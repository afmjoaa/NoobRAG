{"question":"How has miniaturization impacted computer circuitry development, and what encryption challenges does this technological progress create?","answer":"Miniaturization has enabled the development of denser computer circuitry, as predicted in the concept of direct manipulation of individual atoms. This has led to developments like nanoscale machines and microscopes that can see things much smaller than possible with scanning electron microscopes. However, this technological advancement poses significant encryption challenges, as the increasing speed of hardware continues to threaten the security of current cryptographic methods. For instance, older encryption standards like DES have become vulnerable due to these advances, requiring the development of more sophisticated encryption methods and ongoing assessment of cryptographic security measures.","context":["There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom\nThere's Plenty of Room at the Bottom is a lecture given by physicist Richard Feynman at an American Physical Society meeting at Caltech on December 29, 1959. Feynman considered the possibility of direct manipulation of individual atoms as a more powerful form of synthetic chemistry than those used at the time. The talk is considered to be a seminal event in the history of nanotechnology, as it inspired the conceptual beginnings of the field decades later.\nFeynman considered a number of interesting ramifications of a general ability to manipulate matter on an atomic scale. He was particularly interested in the possibilities of denser computer circuitry, and microscopes which could see things much smaller than is possible with scanning electron microscopes. These ideas were later realized by the use of the scanning tunneling microscope, the atomic force microscope and other examples of scanning probe microscopy and storage systems such as Millipede, created by researchers at IBM.\nFeynman also suggested that it should be possible, in principle, to make nanoscale machines that \"arrange the atoms the way we want\", and do chemical synthesis by mechanical manipulation.\nHe also presented the \"weird possibility\" of \"swallowing the doctor,\" an idea which he credited in the essay to his friend and graduate student Albert Hibbs. This concept involved building a tiny, swallowable surgical robot by developing a set of one-quarter-scale manipulator hands slaved to the operator's hands to build one-quarter scale machine tools analogous to those found in any machine shop. This set of small tools would then be used by the small hands to build and operate ten sets of one-sixteenth-scale hands and tools, and so forth, culminating in perhaps a billion tiny factories to achieve massively parallel operations. He uses the analogy of a pantograph as a way of scaling down items. This idea was anticipated in part, down to the microscale, by science fiction author Robert A. Heinlein in his 1942 story Waldo.\nAs the sizes got smaller, one would have to redesign some tools, because the relative strength of various forces would change. Although gravity would become unimportant, surface tension would become more important, Van der Waals attraction would become important, etc. Feynman mentioned these scaling issues during his talk. Nobody has yet attempted to implement this thought experiment, although it has been noted that some types of biological enzymes and enzyme complexes (especially ribosomes) function chemically in a way close to Feynman's vision.\nAt the meeting, Feynman concluded his talk with two challenges, and he offered a prize of $1000 for the first individuals to solve each one. The first challenge involved the construction of a tiny motor, which, to Feynman's surprise, was achieved by November 1960 by William McLellan, a meticulous craftsman, using conventional tools. The motor met the conditions, but did not advance the art. The second challenge involved the possibility of scaling down letters small enough so as to be able to fit the entire Encyclopædia Britannica on the head of a pin, by writing the information from a book page on a surface 1/25,000 smaller in linear scale. In 1985, Tom Newman, a Stanford graduate student, successfully reduced the first paragraph of A Tale of Two Cities by 1/25,000, and collected the second Feynman prize.\nK. Eric Drexler later took the Feynman concept of a billion tiny factories and added the idea that they could make more copies of themselves, via computer control instead of control by a human operator, in his 1986 book Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology.\nAfter Feynman's death, scholars studying the historical development of nanotechnology have concluded that his actual role in catalyzing nanotechnology research was limited, based on recollections from many of the people active in the nascent field in the 1980s and 1990s. Chris Toumey, a cultural anthropologist at the University of South Carolina, has reconstructed the history of the publication and republication of Feynman’s talk, along with the record of citations to “Plenty of Room” in the scientific literature. In Toumey's 2008 article, \"Reading Feynman into Nanotechnology\", he found 11 versions of the publication of “Plenty of Room\", plus two instances of a closely related talk by Feynman, “Infinitesimal Machinery,” which Feynman called “Plenty of Room, Revisited.” Also in Toumey’s references are videotapes of that second talk.\nToumey found that the published versions of Feynman’s talk had a negligible influence in the twenty years after it was first published, as measured by citations in the scientific literature, and not much more influence in the decade after the Scanning Tunneling Microscope was invented in 1981. Subsequently, interest in “Plenty of Room” in the scientific literature greatly increased in the early 1990s. This is probably because the term “nanotechnology” gained serious attention just before that time, following its use by Drexler in his 1986 book, Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology, which cited Feynman, and in a cover article headlined \"Nanotechnology\", published later that year in a mass-circulation science-oriented magazine, OMNI. The journal Nanotechnology was launched in 1989; the famous Eigler-Schweizer experiment, precisely manipulating 35 xenon atoms, was published in Nature in April 1990; and Science had a special issue on nanotechnology in November 1991. These and other developments hint that the retroactive rediscovery of Feynman’s “Plenty of Room” gave nanotechnology a packaged history that provided an early date of December 1959, plus a connection to the charisma and genius of Richard Feynman.\nToumey’s analysis also includes comments from distinguished scientists in nanotechnology who say that “Plenty of Room” did not influence their early work, and in fact most of them had not read it until a later date.\nFeynman's stature as a Nobel laureate and as an iconic figure in 20th century science surely helped advocates of nanotechnology and provided a valuable intellectual link to the past. More concretely, his stature and concept of atomically precise fabrication played a role in securing funding for nanotechnology research, illustrated by President Clinton January 2000 speech calling for a Federal program:\nMy budget supports a major new National Nanotechnology Initiative, worth $500 million. Caltech is no stranger to the idea of nanotechnology the ability to manipulate matter at the atomic and molecular level. Over 40 years ago, Caltech's own Richard Feynman asked, \"What would happen if we could arrange the atoms one by one the way we want them?\"\nFiction byproducts \n- In The Tree of Time, a short story published in 1964, Damon Knight uses the idea of a barrier which has to be constructed atom by atom (a time barrier, in the story).\nSee also \n- Eric, Drexler. \"There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom\".\n- Colin Milburn.

But the widespread use of computers, and the attacks to which they are vulnerable, has expanded the need for secure communications around the globe. This book describes the protection afforded by modern computer cryptographic systems and explains how the pace of modern technology requires continuing attention to the security of those systems.\nThe advent of computers changed a great many things, but not the fundamentals of cryptography. Through stories and pictures, Cryptography Decrypted presents cryptography's evolution into a modern-day science, laying out patterns from the past that are applicable today. It also gives you a thorough understanding of terms that are destined to become as much a part of our language and life as megabyte and Internet. As you begin to think about controlling various aspects of your life using wired or wireless communication, on line all the time, your understanding of cryptography--its benefits and its pitfalls--will make you feel a little more in control of a rapidly changing world.\nBecause rapid advances in the speed of hardware will continue to threaten the security of current cryptographic methods, it's essential that you choose appropriate techniques and perform ongoing assessment if you want to maintain your digital security. You can make such choices and assessments only if you know the basic concepts of cryptography. Cryptography Decrypted offers you that knowledge through visual representation of difficult concepts, an easy-to-use reference for reviewing key cryptographic terminology, and instructive historical information.\nYou need little or no background in cryptography to read this book. Neither does it require technical or math genius. It's designed so that anyone from CIOs to self-taught computer enthusiasts--and everyone in between--can pick up this book without any knowledge of encryption and find it fascinating, understandable, and instructive.\nIf you have some understanding of computer cryptography, Cryptography Decrypted is systematic and comprehensive enough to solidify your knowledge. It provides a simple description of the component parts of secret key and public key cryptography. (Those who already understand and don't wish to cover any more material about secret key cryptography may choose to read only Parts II through IV, bypassing Part I.)\nThroughout the book, we use images to clarify cryptographic terms. After explaining the basic cryptographic components, we describe real-world cryptographic systems, some possible attacks on those systems, and ways to protect your keys.\nThe book provides a historical framework on which to build your understanding of how and why computer cryptography works. After a discussion of how cryptography has evolved into an essential Internet tool, we analyze secret key exchange problems and then explain the evolution of public key cryptography, with its solution to the key exchange problem. Along the way we explain some simple background on the math tricks that make public key cryptography secure. Traditionally, those who have thoroughly understood cryptography have been trained as mathematicians or scientists. Our goal here is to explain computer cryptography with rather little discussion of math. If the esoteric details aren't of immediate concern to you, you can skip Chapter 11 (\"Making Public Keys: Math Tricks\"), Chapter 14 (\"Message Digest Assurances\"), and the appendixes without diminishing your understanding of the basic concepts. Appendix A describes some aspects of public key mathematics, including inverses, primes, the Fermat test, Diffie-Hellman, DSA, elliptic curve, and pseudo-random number generation. Appendix B provides details of IPsec, a security system introduced in Chapter 21.\nIf your computer is connected to or transmits over an electronic network, your data is on the front line. Attackers are getting more competent by the month, and their attacks more intrusive, virulent, and widespread--from Melissa to the Love Bug to the unknown virus that ate your hard drive.\nAlthough few of us leave our valuables unlocked, few of us know how to use cryptographic locks to secure our digital possessions. By the time you finish reading this book, you will.\nMost governments, including those of Canada, China, France, Saudi Arabia, and the United States, consider cryptographic tools to be munitions of war, so it's reasonable to think of potential attacks on your data as a kind of war. Your opponent is anyone who wants to read, modify, or destroy your private documents.\nIn large part, this is a book about the cryptographic keys and methods you use to safeguard your digital possessions. Figure I-1 shows cryptographic keys and the symbols we use to portray them. Part I of this book explains secret keys and secret key methods. Part II describes public and private keys and public key methods. Part III explains how keys are distributed, and Part IV shows how three real-world systems--secure mail, Secure Socket Layer (SSL), and Internet Protocol Security (IPsec)--use cryptographic keys and methods.\n|A Devastating Opponent|\n|In World War II the German Observation Service--Beobachtungs-Dienst, or B-Dienst--was a small group of codebreakers who played a powerful role in the Battle of the Atlantic. B-Dienst uncovered the positions of Allied convoys that German submarines then destroyed, devastating the Allied Atlantic forces from 1941 to 1943. For example, during three days in March 1943, the Germans sank 21 Allied vessels while losing only one submarine. Better communications security and new technologies such as sonar helped the Allies turn the tide.|\nNeed a Quick Read?\n|Section||Chapter(s)||Major Points Covered|\n|Part I: Secret Key||1-4||The difference between cryptographic methods and cryptographic keys.

{"question":"For my advocacy work, I need to understand: What are the key focus areas of advocacy on World Human Rights Day versus International Women's Day in the modern era?","answer":"World Human Rights Day focuses on promoting awareness about fundamental human rights broadly, with medical students and IFMSA members particularly emphasizing the right to health, freedom of opinion and expression, and fighting against discrimination, violence, and corruption. In contrast, International Women's Day's modern advocacy centers specifically on women's rights and challenges, including equal wages, education and training opportunities, occupational advancement, social security conditions, and protection against violence and prostitution. While Human Rights Day takes a comprehensive approach to human rights, International Women's Day specifically addresses women's roles both in society and at home, recognizing their contributions while advocating for concrete improvements in their lives.","context":["December 10th 2012, marks World Human Rights Day, the anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights on Dec. 10, 1948. Today, members of International Federation of Medical Students´ Federation (IFMSA) contribute their voices to support the World Human Rights Day with a goal to promote the awareness about fundamental human rights and its violations.\nIt has been a year like no other for human rights. Human rights have been the center of many global discussions and topics, and remain a vital aspect of our global community. Now, the voices of medical students are being heard in their fights to stand for human rights. Now the medical student has an important role in human rights activism, and this is most certainly the case with the members of the IFMSA. Human Rights Day is an opportunity, every year, for medical students of the IFMSA to celebrate human rights, diversity, and advocate for the full enjoyment of all rights to all people everywhere. These human rights, the rights to freedom of opinion and expression (as highlighted in articles 19 and 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human rights) have been the center to the countless historical changes that have been taking place throughout the world.\nWe, the IFMSA, stand up for human rights, by taking the lead locally and globally. We stand with our fellow medical students around the world who struggle for their rights and freedoms, and to be treated with dignity and respect. Furthermore, we stand by the firm belief in strengthening our security and well being, and by standing against the abuses of human rights which feed into many of the dangers in the world that we confront; be it hatred, violence, conflict, corruption, or discrimination we the IFMSA believe that it is our duty as future physicians to integrate a human rights-based approach to health in our practice. As future health care professionals, it is our duty to advance the right to health in international education, development process, and advocate for health related human rights.\nHuman rights day holds a very important part to medical students, that is because in IFMSA SCORP every year, we celebare this day and take this as a chance for a global campaign to stand together and spread awareness about all human rights. What may seem as an ordinary fact to anyone, may be something that individuals around the world may not even know about. It is this united stance that we take to voice our thoughts to the global community of health care professionals on the importance of human rights, with emphasis on the right to health. Let us not forget, that the enjoyment of the highest attainable stand of health is one of the fundamental rights of every human being.\nOn December 10th, medical students all over the world use their voices by concentrating on raising awareness, building knowledge, skills and raising support for those in need through numerous activities; such as lectures, exhibitions, debates, distribution of information on human rights, movie nights, peer education workshops, charity, and raising awareness. Today, we medical students, salute all those who have suffered so much seeking what is rightfully theirs, and all those people all over the world who in their own way are also saying we have a voice, we have our rights, we want them to be protected and respected. Simply because that is how is should be.\nFares Al Fares, on behalf of human rights action team","International Women's Day\n(Also known as International Working Women's Day)\nInternational Women's Day is observed next on Wednesday, March 8th, 2023 (287 days from today).\nInternational Women's Day is celebrated on March 8 every year, also known as the United Nations Day for Women's Rights and International Peace. International Women's Day has been formalized by the United Nations since 1977. In some countries around the world, March 8 is considered an official, important holiday of the year. This is an opportunity for the whole society to express affection, care and respect for women.\nHistory of International Women's Day\nThe history of March 8 begins at the end of the 19th century, with the movement of American textile workers. On March 8, 1857, to against their harsh and squalid working conditions in New York City, textile workers stood up to fight. Two years later, on March 8, 1859, American women workers in the textile factory who formed the first union were protected and gained some rights.\nAbout 50 years later, on March 8, 1908, 15,000 women marched through the streets of New York demanding higher wages, reduced working hours, and the abolition of child labor. Later, February 28, 1909 was declared International Women’s Day by the Socialist Party of America.\nHowever, on March 8, 1910, at the Women's Conference organized by the Second International (the Socialist International), 100 women delegates from 17 countries demanded the right to vote for women. The President of the Conference, German woman, her name is Clara Zetkin, proposed to choose an international women's day to remember the women who fought all over the world. The conference decided to choose March 8 as International Women's Day, a day to unite women's struggle with the slogans: \"8-hour working day\", \"Equal work\", \"Protecting mothers\" and children\".\nSince then, March 8 every year has become the day of common struggle of working women around the world, a demonstration of the will to fight of women around the world fighting for national independence and democracy, peace and social progress; for the welfare of women and children.\nMeaning of International Women's Day\nIn 365 days of a year, women around the world have their own day to be taken care of by society and compensate for the disadvantages and hardships in life.\nNo one can deny the great role and responsibility of modern women: They are both housewives and social workers, contributing their energies to the development of the country, not only that, they also hold a noble role as a mother, carrying the burden of giving birth to children and raising them to become human. Women today are gradually asserting themselves as beautiful women, not as weak as before.\nIn some countries around the world, International Women's Day 8/3 is considered as the main holiday of the year and is very celebrated. On this day, men give flowers and gifts to the women in their lives such as mothers, wives, girlfriends, etc.\nIn some countries, International Women's Day is celebrated with festivals and parades demanding equal rights with men, on practical issues such as wages, education and training opportunities and promotion in occupation or social security conditions, against prostitution and violence against women…\nObserving International Women's Day\nOn International Women's Day, let's send our love and sincere thanks to the women around us, the resilient, indomitable women who work hard to take care of their families. Women deserve more respect in today's life. Women are often associated with flowers because flowers are often beautiful and fragile like a woman. Give them colorful bouquets, or simply let them rest in the house, leaving the rest for everyone to do. You can participate in observing festivals and parades honoring women in many countries. In some countries, schools or governing bodies will organize activities for women to showcase their talents and recognize them. For example, in Vietnam, on International Women's Day, schools will organize a flower arrangement contest by female teachers.

Raja Ampat's waters contain 1,309 fish species, 537 coral species, and 699 mollusk species in its Cenderawasih Bay marine park. In comparison, the waters around Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Penida have been documented to contain at least 247 species of coral and 562 species of reef fish.","context":["Nusa Lembongan is an island located southeast of Bali, Indonesia at Coordinates: . It is part of a group of three islands, Pulau Penida, of which it is the most famous. This island group in turn is part of the Lesser Sunda Islands.\nAdministratively, the island is part of a subdistrict of Klungkung regency. Nusa Lembongan is one of three small offshore islands which make up a sub-regency of Klungkung, the others being: Nusa Penida and Nusa Ceningan. Nusa Lembongan is the only one of the three islands within the sub-regency to have any tourist infrastructure and is a popular side destination for visitors to Bali.\nNusa Lembongan is approximately 8 square kilometres in size with a permanent population estimated at 5,000. Twelve kilometres of the Badung Strait separates Nusa Lembongan from Bali Island. The island is surrounded by coral reefs with white sand beaches and low limestone cliffs. Nusa Lembongan is separated from Nusa Cenignan by a shallow estuarine channel which is difficult to navigate at low tide. There is a suspension bridge linking Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Ceningan and this takes foot and motorbike traffic only. There are no permanent waterways on Nusa Lembongan.\nThere are three main villages on the island. Jungut Batu and Mushroom Bay are the centres of the tourist-based industry and activities on the island whilst much of the permanent local population resides in Lembongan Village.\nTo the east, the Lombok Strait separates the three islands from Lombok, and marks the biogeographical division between the fauna of the Indomalayan ecozone and the distinctly different fauna of Australasia. The transition is known as the Wallace Line, named after Alfred Russel Wallace, who first proposed a transition zone between these two major biomes.\nThe north-eastern side of the island is flanked by a relatively large area of mangroves totalling some 212 hectares.\nThe economy is largely tourism-based and Nusa Lembongan is the only one of the three neighbouring islands to have any significant tourism-based infrastructure. There is also subsistence agriculture and fishing on the island and a seaweed farming micro-industry.\nMarine conservation is considered extremely important to sustaining future levels of tourism on the island and in February 2009, a local NGO from Nusa Lembongan, facilitated by The Nature Conservancy Coral Triangle Center, opened a community centre on Nusa Lembongan. The waters around Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Penida have at least 247 species of coral and 562 species of reef fish.\n- Government Office of the Regency of Klungkung, http://www.klungkungkab.go.id/main.php?go=profil\n- All about Nusa Lembongan, http://nusalembongannews.blogspot.com/2009/05/news-and-rambles-from-nusa-lembongan.html\n- About Nusa Lembongan, http://www.nusalembonganproperty.com/about_nusa_lembongan.htm\n- Survey and Condition of the Mangrove Forest at Nusa Lembongan and Nusa Ceningan, http://ejournal.unud.ac.id/abstrak/jenis%20tumbuhan.pdf\n- The Jakarta Post, Feb 24th 2009, http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/02/24/residents-lack-tools-monitor-destructive-fishing.html\n- United Nations Fisheries and Aquaculture Department, Production of Seaweed in Indonesia, http://www.fao.org/docrep/field/009/ag155e/AG155E05.htm#ref4.5\n- The Nature Conservancy Coral Triangle Center in Nusa Lembongan, News February 21st 2009, http://www.coraltrianglecenter.org/\n- News from Nusa Lembongan, http://nusalembongannews.blogspot.com/2009/07/visitors-to-nusa-lembongan-doing-their.html\n- The Jakarta Post, July 16th 2009, http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/07/16/baby-sea-turtles-head-a-big-adventure.html\n|Wikimedia Commons has media related to Nusa Lembongan.|\n- Nusa Lembongan travel guide from Wikivoyage","Sometimes the best views of the islands are from underwater. Whether you like to SCUBA dive or snorkel, these islands have some of the most beautiful reefs in the world from exotic fish families to coral formations. Take a look at these 10 exotic locations for an underwater safari.\nLord Howe Island, Australia\nIn the Tasman Sea about 370 miles east of Australia is Lord Howe Island, a group of islands in the middle of the Great Barrier Reef. To maintain their pristine water ecosystem, Lord Howe only permits 400 tourists a time to visit. More than 500 species of fish and 90 varieties of coral call this area home. Try diving at Balls Pyramid, the world’s tallest sea stack, surrounded by marine sanctuaries.\nAnother exclusive spot, Bonaire, is one of the ABC islands in the Caribbean. With Aruba and Curacao, Bonaire forms the Leeward Antilles just north of Venezuela. The island only permits one boat at a time at each of Bonaire’s 100 dive sites. You can walk into the water to dive 1,000 Steps or head to Captain Don’s Reef, named for Don Stewart, a pioneer of sustainable travel here. The waters surrounding Bonaire’s reefs have been protected for the past 30 years.\nRaja Ampat, Indonesia\nAn archipelago of 1,500 islands, cays and shoals surround Raja Ampat in Indonesia’s West Papua province. Within is the Cenderawasih Bay, literally meaning “bird of paradise” is the largest marine park. The diversity of marine life in this area includes 1,309 fish species, 537 coral species and 699 mollusk species. Try diving at one of the dive resorts on Kri Island or snorkeling on Cape Kri, also known as the highway of fish for its enormous schools of fish.\nAbout 500 miles east of the Philippines and 2,000 miles south of Tokyo in the Pacific Ocean is Palau, a nation made up of more than 200 islands. While only eight islands are inhabited, they are located in a single barrier reef. Here you can see more than 1,300 fish species and 700 corals. Among the most fascinating are the mandarinfish and giant tridacna clams.\nAnother Indonesian archipelago, Wakatobi, sits in the southeastern portion of the country and takes its name from the first two letters of the main islands: Wangiwangi Island, Kaledupa, Tomea and Binongko. The region contains the highest coral reef biodiversity in the world. The Collaborative Reef Conservation Program deems that many of the sites in the Coral Triangle can only be visited once per stay. See some of the diverse underwater characters such as a hairy squat lobster at The Zoo site or a creature affectionately called the Oriental Sweetlips on the Magnifica plateau.\nMalaysia’s only oceanic island rises 2,000 feet from the seabed in the Celebes Sea off the east coast of East Malaysia. Coral growing on an extinct volcanic cone form the island. More than 3,000 species of fish and hundreds of coral call this region home. Find schools of chevron barracuda at Barracuda Point as well as green sea turtles. Jacques Cousteau once called Sipadan “an untouched piece of art” 30 years ago.\nThe third largest barrier reef in the world, known locally as the Big Yard, sits off the coast of Andros Island, the largest island in the Bahamas. Andros is really three islands made up of North Andros, Mangrove Cay and South Andros. More than 3,000 species of fish reside here. Look for the sea monster Lucsa who lives in the blue holes underwater, or so the legend goes.\nHawaii’s Forbidden Isle is the smallest of the islands, taking up a mere 70 square miles 17 miles southwest of Kaua’i. Privately owned Niihau allows no tourists, but a two-hour boat ride brings you to the Niihau Arches, where you can find endangered monk seals. Experience it’s raw, untamed vibe.\nThe second largest coral reef in the world is in the Belize Barrier Reef, best accessed from the islands of Belize. The 186-mile long reef sits 1,000 feet offshore in the north and 25 miles in the south. Here you can dive the Lighthouse, Blue Hole and Turneffe. Eight marine reserves, 450 cays and three atolls make up the coral reef here.\nThis dragon-shaped island is filled with white sand beaches and the soft coral capital of the South Pacific. The 30-mile long Namena Barrier Reef off the mile-long island of Namenalala contains a diversified eco-system described by diving publications at one of the best in Fiji."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:39cc90ea-bc15-4c3a-8f88-04a1155b9db2>","<urn:uuid:eefac5e7-2f31-4e17-a596-a1d785057b33>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What similarities exist between addressing mental health stigma in Utah and implementing sustainable practices in cryptocurrency?","answer":"Utah shows signs of being more enlightened about mental health, with people being more willing to seek help and access mental health services due to better employer benefits and reduced stigma. This progressive approach parallels the cryptocurrency industry's efforts to address its challenges, where companies are actively working to reduce their environmental impact through sustainable practices like using renewable energy sources, developing energy-efficient mining equipment, and implementing proof-of-stake consensus mechanisms. In both cases, there's a recognition that addressing these issues head-on - whether it's mental health treatment or environmental sustainability - is crucial for long-term success and societal acceptance.","context":["Utah/Statistical claims/LDS use of antidepressants\nIs the rate of antidepressant use in Utah much higher among Mormons than the general population?\nIt is claimed by some that the rate of antidepressant use is much higher among Mormons than the general population.\n- Is this evidence that participation in the LDS Church is inordinately stressful due to pressure for Mormons to appear \"perfect?\"\nTo see citations to the critical sources for these claims, click here\nWhile Utah does have the highest rate of antidepressant use in the United States, there is no evidence that this is because of stress from the LDS lifestyle and culture. Credible research has shown that LDS women are actually more likely to identify themselves as \"happy\" than non-Mormon women. Religion generally (and the LDS religion specifically) has been repeatedly shown to be either beneficial or neutral for mental health and well-being.\nWithout further research, critics of the Church have no convincing evidence that higher anti-depressant use in Utah is caused by problems or difficulties associated with being a believing, practicing Latter-day Saint.\nPrescription drug use by state or region has been difficult to assess. In 2002 Express Scripts, one of the largest mail-order pharmaceutical providers in the United States, released their Prescription Drug Atlas, which shows prescription drug orders from their individual clients by state. A Los Angeles Times article on the study concluded that\n[A]ntidepressant drugs are prescribed in Utah more often than in any other state, at a rate nearly twice the national average.... Other states with high antidepressant use were Maine and Oregon. Utah's rate of antidepressant use was twice the rate of California and nearly three times the rates in New York and New Jersey, the study showed. \nAre Latter-day Saint women in Utah more depressed?\nWhat the study did not indicate is the reason antidepressant use was higher in Utah than in other states. Critics of the Church were quick to correlate this data with the high rate of LDS Church membership in Utah, thus blaming the Church and Mormon culture for the problem. Kent Ponder Ph.D, a Latter-day Saint, produced an article in which he correlates the use of antidepressants specifically with pressures placed on Mormon women. Ponder concludes:\nThis problem is clearly, closely and definitely linked to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. Approximately 70% of Utahans are Mormons. Jim Jorgenson, director of pharmacy services for the University of Utah, confirmed that Utah has the highest percentage of anti-depressant use, hypothesizing that large families, larger in Utah than in other states, produce greater stress. (Large Utah families are primarily Mormon families).\n- The same LDS Church that works so well for many works very badly for many others, who become chronically depressed, especially women. \nYet the study released by Express Scripts makes no claims as to why some states use more prescription drugs of one type or another. Far from being \"clearly, closely and definitely\" the fault of the LDS Church, Ponder has no evidence whatsoever; he is giving his belief and casting it as a proven fact.\nThe Express Scripts study includes a number of factors that Ponder overlooked in his paper that are helpful in assessing the situation:\n- Utah ranked seventh in total prescriptions overall. This indicates that Utahans are heavier than average users of all prescription medications.\n- Utah also ranked high in use of penicillin, insulin, thyroid hormones, antirheumatics, and anticonvulsants. Is Mormon culture also responsible for higher incidences of infection, diabetes, hypothyroidism, arthritis, and epilepsy?\n- Idaho and Arizona, the two other states in the \"Mormon Corridor\" with large LDS populations, did not rate high in antidepressant use. If LDS culture is responsible for high levels of stress leading to antidepressant use, why didn't those two states rank closer to Utah?\nThere are other possible factors outside the scope of the Express Scripts study that may also play a part here:\n- The results could indicate that Utahans are more enlightened about depression and mental illness and therefore don't stigmatize these conditions. In such a social climate more people are willing to seek help and are prescribed drugs.\n- The results could also indicate that Utah employers offer better mental health benefits than employers in other states, making access to mental health services and medications easier. \n- Utah has a low rate of recreational alcohol use, especially among practicing Mormons who completely abstain from alcoholic beverages. Alcohol is commonly used by adults as an aid to stress relief, a \"lubricant\" for social interactions, and to \"treat\" (unwittingly or not) symptoms of anxiety, depression, and the like. Since many Mormons will not consider alcohol an \"option,\" they could be more likely to seek help from a professional instead of turning to commercially available mood-altering substances.\nAre Mormons more depressed than non-Mormons?\nThe critics' attitude toward members of the Church is nothing new. The same approach was taken by 19th-century critics:\n- In 1858 a writer from Harper's Weekly traveled to Utah and made the observation that the Latter-day Saint lifestyle turned LDS women into \"haggard, weary, slatternly women, with lackluster eyes and wan, shapeless faces, hanging listlessly over their gates, or sitting idly in the sunlight, perhaps nursing their yelling babies—all such women looking alike depressed, degraded, miserable, hopeless, soulless\" (G. L. Bunker and D. Binton, as cited in Judd 1987, p. 150). In 1860, Dr. Robert Bartholomew, the assistant surgeon of the United States Army, visited Utah and described LDS men as having \"an expression of compounded sensuality, cunning suspicion, and a smirking self-conceit.\" While many anecdotal descriptions (such as the ones above), essays (see Burgoyne and Burgoyne 1978), and media specials have discussed the detrimental effects of the LDS lifestyle on mental health (especially that of LDS women), few have any grounding in research evidence. None of the studies included in this analysis that included depression as one of its variables indicated support for an unhealthy relationship between Mormonism and depression. \nShortly after Mr. Ponder released his paper, Brigham Young University sociologist Sherrie Mills Johnson used data from national surveys to show that Mormon women are less likely to be depressed than American women in general. Johnson's conclusions upheld findings of some earlier studies that Mormons have no more depression than the nation's population as a whole. \nA good review of the literature on religion, mental health, and the Latter-day Saints specifically is now available on-line: Daniel K. Judd, \"Religiosity, Mental Health, and the Latter-day Saints: A Preliminary Review of Literature (1923-95),\" in Latter-day Saint Social Life: Social Research on the LDS Church of its Members, edited by James T. Duke, (Religious Studies Center, Brigham Young University, 1998) off-site the abstract of which reads:\n- Analysis of the data indicates that Latter-day Saints who live their lives consistent with their religious beliefs experience greater general well-being and marital and family stability, and less delinquency, depression, anxiety, and substance abuse than those who do not. This review of research also concludes that there is very little support for the assertion made by some that religious belief, practice, or affiliation is antithetical to mental health.... \nIn religious people generally,\n- 59% of studies from 1985–1995 suggest a positive benefit on mental health; another 26% were neutral. \n- \"This most recent analysis of data (1985-95) indicates that high scores on measures of religiosity (activity, attitude, affiliation, and belief) are facilitative of marital and family stability, adjustment, and personal well-being. This most recent analysis also indicates that those who score high on measures of religiosity show the highest positive correlation with measures of mental health. Also, those who score higher on scales of \"intrinsic\" religiosity score better on measures of mental health than those with an \"extrinsic\" religious orientation. There also appears to be little difference in measures of mental pathology with respect to religious affiliation.\" \nThat is, an active inner spiritual life is more protective than merely outward forms of religious observance.\nFor studies involving members of the Church of Jesus Christ specifically:\n- 70% were positive; 24% had neutral effects on mental health (thus, only 6% showed a negative effect); \n- LDS women were less depressed than other women; LDS men were no different from non-LDS men. \nThus, the available research does not support the contention that religious people have more mental health problems than non-religious people, or that being a Latter-day Saint religious person is mentally unhealthy. If anything, being LDS is protective against mental health difficulties, which is in keeping with the general consensus that religion is psychologically beneficial.\nCorrelation or causation?\nIt is easy to find a correlation between two things:\n- Utah has many Mormons and uses more antidepressants than other states.\n- Roosters crow when the sun rises.\n- IV drug abuse has increased as digital computers have become more common.\nHowever, correlations do not necessarily imply causation:\n- The suggestion that religion in general, or the Church of Jesus Christ in particular, causes depression has been examined and found to be false: in the vast majority of studies, religion either has no effect on mental health, or improves it.\n- Roosters do not cause the sun to rise; if anything the reverse is true.\n- IV drug use and the presence of digital computers are not likely related at all--they are two different social phenomena.\nCorrelations are easy to come by. They may suggest causes for further study, but they mean little by themselves. They prove nothing.\nCritics like to point to a correlation between a high LDS population and a high anti-depressant use, and then assume that this is causative. But, they either do not know—or do not want us to know—that the causation which the correlation suggests has been tested, and has not supported the conclusion they wish to draw.\nCritics who use this approach are therefore often guilty of at least one logical fallacy:\nOther evidence about levels of happiness in Utah\nIf we are going to use Utah as a surrogate measure for Mormons (something which may not be proper), we should also consider evidence on the other side of the coin.\nA 2013 paper found that, based upon Twitter metrics, Utah is in the top five most happy states:\n- The happiest 5 states, in order, are: Hawaii, Maine, Nevada, Utah and Vermont. The saddest 5 states, in order, are: Louisiana, Mississippi, Maryland, Delaware and Georgia. \nIf we are to blame the Church for Utah's antidepressant use, then we must also credit the Church for Utah's over-all happiness.\n- Julie Cart, \"Study Finds Utah Leads Nation in Antidepressant Use,\" Los Angeles Times, 20 February 2002, A6.\n- Kent Ponder, Ph.D., \"Mormon Women, Prozac® and Therapy,\" unpublished, 2003.

Cryptocurrency is one of the newer and rapidly evolving industries that has been called out for its high energy consumption and carbon footprint. However, the cryptocurrency sector is also built on innovation, decentralization, and financial democratization. The challenge is to balance these two seemingly opposing goals – sustainability and innovation. In this article, we will explore the environmental concerns of cryptocurrency and ways to mitigate its impact while continuing to promote its benefits.\nRead more: Silvergate Collapse Dragging Down Bitcoin Volume\nCryptocurrency is a digital currency that uses encryption techniques to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds. It is decentralized and operates on a peer-to-peer network that enables secure, fast, and anonymous transactions. Cryptocurrency has gained popularity in recent years, with bitcoin being the most well-known example. However, the process of generating cryptocurrency, known as mining, requires significant computational power, which consumes a massive amount of energy.\nThe amount of energy consumed by cryptocurrency mining has sparked concerns about its environmental impact. According to a 2021 report by the Cambridge Center for Alternative Finance, the annual energy consumption of bitcoin mining alone is estimated to be around 128.84 TWh, which is more than the energy consumption of Argentina. The high energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining has led to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions, as the majority of the energy used comes from non-renewable sources like coal and natural gas.\nThe Environmental Impact of Cryptocurrency\nCryptocurrency mining is a highly energy-intensive process that requires specialized computer equipment and software. The process involves solving complex mathematical problems to verify transactions and add new blocks to the blockchain. The first miner to solve the puzzle is rewarded with a certain amount of cryptocurrency.\nTo mine cryptocurrency, miners need to use powerful computers, which consume a considerable amount of energy. The energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining is a function of the computing power used and the time it takes to solve the problem. As the difficulty of the problem increases, more computing power is required, which leads to a higher energy consumption.\nThe high energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining has a significant impact on the environment. Most of the energy used to power cryptocurrency mining comes from non-renewable sources like coal and natural gas. The combustion of fossil fuels leads to the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which contributes to global warming and climate change. The increase in greenhouse gas emissions from cryptocurrency mining is a concern as it undermines global efforts to reduce carbon emissions.\nMitigating the Environmental Impact of Cryptocurrency\nThe environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining can be mitigated by adopting sustainable practices. Some of the ways to reduce the energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining are:\nUsing renewable energy sources: One of the most effective ways to reduce the environmental impact of cryptocurrency mining is to use renewable energy sources like solar, wind, and hydroelectric power. Some cryptocurrency mining companies are already using renewable energy to power their operations. For example, the cryptocurrency mining company, Square, has committed to becoming carbon neutral by 2030.\nDeveloping energy-efficient mining equipment: Cryptocurrency mining companies can reduce their energy consumption by developing energy-efficient mining equipment. For example, some companies are developing ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) that are designed to consume less energy than traditional computer processors.\nImplementing proof-of-stake consensus mechanism: Another way to reduce the energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining is to implement the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. Proof-of-stake is an alternative to proof-of-work, which is the current consensus mechanism used by most cryptocurrencies. Proof-of-stake does not require miners to solve complex mathematical problems to verify transactions. Instead, it relies on a random selection process to choose a validator who is responsible for verifying transactions. Validators are required to hold a certain amount of cryptocurrency, which acts as a stake. If a validator acts maliciously, their stake is forfeited. The proof-of-stake consensus mechanism is less energy-intensive than proof-of-work, making it a more sustainable alternative.\nCarbon offsetting: Cryptocurrency mining companies can offset their carbon emissions by investing in renewable energy projects or purchasing carbon credits. Carbon offsetting is a way to neutralize the carbon emissions associated with cryptocurrency mining by investing in sustainable projects that reduce carbon emissions.\nBalancing Sustainability and Innovation\nCryptocurrency has the potential to revolutionize the financial industry by providing financial democratization and decentralization. However, this cannot come at the expense of the environment. The challenge is to balance sustainability with innovation. The cryptocurrency industry needs to take responsibility for its environmental impact and take steps to mitigate its carbon footprint. It is essential to recognize that sustainability and innovation are not mutually exclusive goals, but rather complementary.\nSustainability is a key factor in the long-term success of cryptocurrency. As the world becomes more conscious of the environment, consumers are looking for sustainable products and services. The cryptocurrency industry needs to recognize this trend and take steps to reduce its carbon footprint. By adopting sustainable practices, the cryptocurrency industry can attract a more environmentally conscious audience.\nCryptocurrency has the potential to transform the financial industry by providing financial democratization and decentralization. However, the high energy consumption of cryptocurrency mining has sparked concerns about its environmental impact. To balance sustainability and innovation, the cryptocurrency industry needs to take responsibility for its carbon footprint and adopt sustainable practices. By using renewable energy sources, developing energy-efficient mining equipment, implementing proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, and carbon offsetting, the cryptocurrency industry can mitigate its environmental impact. Sustainability is not a trade-off for innovation, but rather a complementary goal that is essential for the long-term success of the cryptocurrency industry."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ca81f0df-8f41-4f3b-98c6-5293585b0df0>","<urn:uuid:16d423b7-32cb-493a-822d-c068233478c4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the censorship experiences of contemporary Iranian writers compare with Forough Farrokhzad's artistic freedom in expressing social criticism?","answer":"Contemporary Iranian writers face severe censorship restrictions, with some waiting months or years for publication permission. For example, writer Mohammad Mohammad-Ali waited over two and a half years to publish 10 books, with only one approved. Censors scrutinize texts for words like 'wine', 'kiss', and 'meditation', and writers must substitute these with 'appropriate' phrases. In contrast, Forough Farrokhzad, in the 1950s and 1960s, was able to openly criticize social conditions, including discrimination against women and dictatorship. She published five volumes of poetry addressing controversial themes and even created a documentary film about lepers that won an international award. However, the current regime has banned her books and prohibited displays of her posters, demonstrating the increasing restrictions on artistic expression in Iran.","context":["Iran's former culture minister, Ataollah Mohajerani, has criticised the country's supreme leader for restricting access to literature after Ayatollah Ali Khamenei publicly attacked \"harmful books\" and likened them to \"poisonous\" drugs.\nIn a meeting with librarians and officials from Iran's book industry on Wednesday, Khamenei spoke out against books \"with a cultural appe arance but with specific political hidden motives.\n\"Not all books are necessarily good and not all of them are unharmful, some books are harmful,\" he said, according to his official website, Khamenei.ir.\nMohajerani who was culture minister until 2000 under the reformist president Mohammad Khatami, said the ayatollah was worried about \"literary, philosophical and social\" books that might raise questions about his legitimacy as the supreme leader. \"I think that he is very much concerned about books that can either implicitly or explicitly target his position as the supreme leader and also his legitimacy.\"\nHe had fallen foul of the ayatollah when he was at the ministry as he favoured greater cultural openness and removed thousands of titles from the lists of banned books. Some analysts believe his lack of deference to the hardline ayatollah was another reason he came under attack from conservative clerics which finally forced him to resign. Numerous publications were closed down after he went. He currently lives in exile in London.\nIn his speech, the 72-year-old Khamenei, whose pronouncements are often interpreted as official guidelines, refused to give more details on which books he deemed \"harmful\". However, titles ranging from uncensored version of Plato's Symposium to Louis-Ferdinand Céline's Journey to the End of the Night and works by James Joyce, Gabriel García Márquez, Kurt Vonnegut and Paulo Coelho have been banned in recent years by Iran's ministry of culture and Islamic guidance which vets all books before publication.\nAccording to Mohajerani, Khamenei is a fan of fiction and closely follows publication of novels and other literary books.\n\"Those responsible in the book industry should not let harmful books enter our book market on the basis that we let them [readers] choose [what they want to read],\" Khamenei told cheering crowds.\n\"Like poisonous, dangerous and addictive drugs which are not available for everyone without restrictions … as a publisher, librarian or an official in the book industry, we don't have the right to make [such books] available to those without knowledge,\" he said. \"We should provide them with healthy and good books.\"\nMohajerani said: \"His comments stem from a traditional clerical mentality that clerics guide people as shepherds guide their sheep, this is a viewpoint that doesn't have any place in today's life.\"\nAlthough Iran's constitution prohibits censorship, publishers are required to submit all books to the cultural ministry where they are usually checked by three separate people charged with censoring words and phrases or labelling them as \"inappropriate\" for publication.\nThe supreme leader's comments come weeks after several writers complained about the time-consuming procedure of book publishing; some said they have waited several months and even years for permission.\nMohammad Mohammad-Ali, a celebrated fiction writer told the semi-official Isna news agency in a recent interview that he had waited for over two and a half years for permission to publish 10 of his books, but only one had so far been approved for publication.\nHassan Homayoun, a journalist and poet who has monitored censorship in Iran has published on his blog a series of comments made by censors.\nAccording to Homayoun, in review of a poetry book, a censor commented that it lacked appropriate rhythm. With regard to a book by Gholam-Hossein Saedi, the censor said it contained sexually-provocative material and was too ambiguous and allegorical. In review of a book written by celebrated writer Mahmoud Dolatabadi, a censor said that it was too depressing.\nCensors go as far as advising writers to substitute certain words with other \"appropriate\" phrases, should they wish their book to be approved.\nIn an interview with the semi-official Ilna news agency, another writer, Mohammad Baghaei Makan, said he was asked to change \"wine\" to \"coffee\" in a text he wrote in which he, ironically, expressed contempt for wine.\nAccording to Ilna, words such as \"kiss\", \"beloved\", \"wine\" ,\"drunk\", \"pork\", \"dance\", \"rape\", \"dog\" and \"meditation\" are among others frequently asked to be substituted.\nShahriar Mandanipour, an Iranian novelist and a victim of censorship in Iran, has written a novel based on his experiences. Censoring an Iranian Love Story, published in 2009, follows the journey of a fictional writer who meets the man responsible for censoring his book.\nIn the face of book censorship in Iran, many celebrated writers such as Mahmoud Dolatabadi and Reza Barahani whose books are banned in Iran have chosen to publish their books in other languages outside the country.","Forough Farrokhzad (December 29, 1934 – February 13, 1967) was the first Iranian poet to promote the culture of women in poetry.\nExpressing her thoughts on discrimination and inequality, Forough described Iranian women’s untold suffering.\nIn a letter dated January 2, 1956, Forough wrote, “My wish is for Iranian women to be free and equal to men. I am fully aware that my sisters in this country suffer from men’s injustices, and I use half of my art to articulate their pain and anguish.”\n“I need poetry above eating and sleeping, something like breathing.”\nForough Farrokhzad was born in Tehran on December 29, 1934. A famous contemporary Iranian poet, she published a collection of five volumes: Captive, Wall, Rebellion, Another Birth, and Let Us Believe in the Dawn of the Cold Season.\nForough’s poetry symbolizes a woman imprisoned by ancient traditions and seeking the light. Her depth and thoughtfulness were perfectly articulated in her work, Another Birth, published in 1963.\nAnother Birth dealt with the social conditions of the time, including dictatorship. In this work, Forough described a lonely woman who was on the verge of a cold season, and therefore seeking light and heat.\nAnd this is I\na woman alone\nat the threshold of a cold season\nat the beginning of understanding\nthe polluted existence of the earth\nand the simple and sad pessimism of the sky\nand the incapacity of these concrete hands.\nFor Forough Farrokhzad, poetry was not for entertainment. Rather, it was a means to achieving a goal. Describing poetry, she said, “It’s a responsibility I feel for myself.” She equated being a poet with being human, saying, “One must be a poet at all times, not just during poetry.”\nBut she believed deeply that she needed to first make and complete herself.\nForough’s brilliance in poetry draws from the human content of her works. After the Shah’s coup d’etat against Iran’s nationalist leader Dr. Mohammad Mossadeq, she called all of Iran a prison. In her poetry, Forough longed for a bright future that was free of oppression and darkness.\nSomeone is coming,\nsomeone is coming,\nsomeone who in his heart is with us,\nin his breathing is with us,\nin his voice is with us,\nsomeone whose coming\ncan’t be stopped\nand handcuffed and thrown in jail…\nForough Farrokhzad’s works have been translated into English, Turkish, Arabic, Chinese, French, Spanish, Japanese, German, and Hebrew.\nCinema as a means of expression\nIn addition to writing poetry, Forough focused on cinema.\nIn 1962, Forough Farrokhzad made the film, “The Dark House,” featuring lepers and their living conditions in a leper colony. The film reflected Forough’s deep emotions about disadvantaged people.\nThe film won the Best Documentary Award at the Oberhausen Film Festival in Germany in the winter of 1963.\n“Cinema is a means of expression for me,” Forough said of her cinematic debut. “If I’ve written poetry all my life, it doesn’t mean that poetry is the only means of expression. I like cinema. I will work in any other field I can. If I can’t write poetry, I’d act in the theater. If I can’t act, I’d make a movie. What’s important is for me to be able to express myself, of course if I have anything to express.”\nThe greatest woman poet of the millennium\n“A thousand years of literary history will recognize Forough as the greatest woman poet,” said Mohammad Reza Shafi’i Kadkani, a contemporary poet. “No intellectual has fought tradition better than Forough did.”\nPen masters equate her artistic value to that of the prominent Iranian poet, Ahmad Shamlou.\nNo article or conversation could do Forough’s work justice. She was one of the greatest contemporary Iranian poets who remembered to fly and achieve unity and light in her poems.\nWhy should I stop?\nI am a descendant of the trees;\nbreathing stale air depresses me;\na bird which died advised me to remember the flight;\nthe ultimate extent of powers is joining\nwith the bright origin of the sun\nand pouring into the understanding of light;\nWhy should I stop?\nTragically, Forough lived for only 32 years. She was killed in a car crash on February 13, 1967.\nForough held the deep belief that love is the only cure for humanity. She wrote:\n“Do goodness then forget it, someday it will grow.”\nThe mullahs’ misogynous and anti-culture regime banned Forough Farrokhzad’s books at the annual book exhibition in Tehran. The regime also prohibited publishers and bookstores from displaying her posters. (The state-run Tabnak website – May 11, 2011)\nIn 2016, Forough Farrokhzad’s home in Tehran’s Darrouss neighborhood was demolished. On November 2, 2016, the state-run Mehr news agency reported that a five-story residential building was being built in place of the home of Forough Farrokhzad."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:06b84e20-e70c-4535-93f3-d31c886fcd40>","<urn:uuid:8d1cadaa-874d-49ce-b750-f3d45c023172>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does environmental pollution impact low-income communities and communities of color differently?","answer":"Research shows that low-income communities and communities of color are more vulnerable to environmental pollution impacts. These communities are more likely to have been burdened by other environmental exposures in the past and/or experience higher rates of psychosocial stress than other communities. The same environmental exposure is more likely to harm health or result in greater harm when it occurs in these populations.","context":["A new mapping analysis by the Natural Resources Defense Council, conducted in close partnership with Chicago community organizations, reinforces what advocates and residents have been calling out for years: the high cumulative vulnerabilities to environmental pollution borne by environmental justice communities in the city.\nThe analysis, conducted by NRDC Science Fellow Yukyan Lam, uses data compiled by U.S. EPA and a methodology developed by academic researchers in conjunction with community groups and state agencies, as explained in more detail below. Mapped against the city’s industrial corridors, the analysis supports the need for land use and public health reforms to address these zones filled with diesel trucks, dusty materials, noxious odors and other environmental hazards, located immediately adjacent to parks and dense residential neighborhoods.\nIn particular, the map calls attention to the cumulative vulnerabilities in Little Village, Pilsen, McKinley/Brighton Park and other nearby Southwest Chicago communities, as well as on the Southeast Side near the Calumet River and Lake Calumet. Communities adjacent to rail yards also show up as highly vulnerable. Unsurprisingly, these communities are largely low-income and communities of color, which research shows compounds their vulnerability to environmental threats.\nOur “cumulative impacts” map of Chicago takes a combined look at environmental conditions along with sociodemographic characteristics that are associated with increased vulnerability to such environmental pollution, comparing the resulting cumulative burden across census block groups. It is a screening tool that brings out disparities and highlights areas in the city that should be targeted for increased environmental monitoring, enhanced enforcement, and land use and public health reform.\nCumulative impacts analysis seeks to look at both environmental and sociodemographic factors because research has shown that the same environmental exposure is more likely to harm health or result in greater harm when it occurs in populations with certain sociodemographic indicators of vulnerability. For instance, young children experience greater personal exposure than adults despite the same level of ambient pollution, as they take in more air relative to their body volume. Seniors are more likely to have pre-existing heart, lung, and other health conditions, making their systems particularly vulnerable to pollution. Low-income communities and communities of color also may be more likely to have been burdened by other environmental exposures in the past and/or to experience higher rates of psychosocial stress than other communities. Looking at environmental and socio-demographic factors together provides a more complete picture than assessing environmental information alone.\nFor this analysis, we relied on data from the 2017 version of EJSCREEN, the U.S. EPA’s environmental justice screening tool. EJSCREEN 2017 collects information from government sources on 11 environmental conditions and 6 population characteristics:\n|Environmental Factors||Population Characteristics|\nWhile EJSCREEN compiles the data we used for our analysis, EJSCREEN itself is limited in its power to look at cumulative impacts. EJSCREEN provides mapping of individual environmental and sociodemographic factors, accompanied by “indices” for each individual environmental factor mapped with only two of the sociodemographic factors, poverty and minority status. In terms of spatial comparisons, EJSCREEN only allows for comparing individual block groups against the state and national levels, not other block groups.\nNRDC’s cumulative impacts analysis, in contrast, is an adapted version of the Environmental Justice Screening Method (EJSM). EJSM was developed by a group of California-based academic researchers in conjunction with community groups and with input from environmental agency officials in that state. Our analysis is based on EJSM, and generates a composite score of 2 to 10 taking into account all 17 EJSCREEN factors for each census block group within Chicago. Higher numbers indicate a higher cumulative burden, as shown by orange-red colors on the map, while lower numbers indicate lower cumulative burdens are shown in blues. More details on the methodology are available here.\nNRDC’s analysis does NOT include health data, as most health data are not available at a fine enough spatial scale to look at block group differences within Chicago. Nor does it purport to assess the relative health risk of living in a given block group, or identify which sources of pollution are the most harmful or which sociodemopgraphic factors render a community the most vulnerable. Even if such health data and risk assessments were available, no scenario of health outcomes would justify the disparate burdens on vulnerable communities indicated by our map.\nEnvironmental Justice Reforms Needed\nNo map is a definitive accounting of real conditions on the ground. The map we have created is intended as a screening tool for further investigation, including going to communities directly to speak with them about their experience of environmental pollution and vulnerabilities, as well as their ideas for making their communities safer and healthier.\nIn other places like Los Angeles, such screening analyses have helped move forward community-based reforms aimed at addressing environmental injustices.\nIn contrast, last summer the Mayor’s office and Chicago City Council re-zoned an industrial area in a wealthier part of the city to encourage high-end commercial and tech development, at the same time incentivizing industrial businesses to relocate to “receiving” industrial corridors like those in Little Village and the Southeast Side.\nNow armed with the cumulative impacts map for the city and examples of reforms from cities like Los Angeles, NRDC stands with our partners at the Little Village Environmental Justice Organization, Southeast Environmental Task Force, Southeast Side Coalition to Ban Petcoke and other members of the Chicago Environmental Justice Network to ask City Council, outgoing Mayor Emanuel, and the city’s soon-to-be-new mayor—what will you do to address these injustices?"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5256114e-28bf-4a25-92c6-20ff38acf7f3>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How was Bobby L. Hill released from Chatham County Jail in 1970?","answer":"Bobby L. Hill was released on Tuesday, October 19, by order of U.S. District Court judge Alexander A. Lawrence. This came after his attorneys filed a petition for habeas corpus in Superior Court and were granted a hearing, though they could not immediately secure a bond for his release.","context":["|Click here to view the item|\n|Creator:||WSB-TV (Television station : Atlanta, Ga.)|\n|Title:||WSB-TV newsfilm clip of a racial demonstration in Savannah, Georgia, 1970 October 16|\n|Date:||1970 Oct. 16|\nIn this WSB newsfilm clip from October 16, 1970, demonstrators in Savannah, Georgia protest the incarceration of Georgia state representative Bobby L. Hill; one of Hill's attorneys comments on his arrest and appeal for release.\nThe clip begins with a shot of a group of African American men walking down the sidewalk; one man in the group waves a red, green and black Pan-African flag on a pole. Next, a Savannah police officer directs street traffic from a motorized tricycle; on the opposite side of the street, a steady crowd of African American pedestrians walk along the sidewalks and crosswalks. Three young African American boys play around by jumping into the camera shot and waving their arms. Next, an unidentified African American attorney speaks to a reporter who is off-camera. The attorney reports that Hill was frisked, handcuffed, then taken to the county jail, where he is currently residing. He says that a motion for an appeal bond is pending with Judge Victor Mulling, the presiding municipal judge who cited Mr. Hill for contempt. The reporter then asks the attorney what his feelings are for Mr. Hill's alleged actions, which involve instructing his defendants that they were free to leave the courtroom without the judge's permission. The attorney responds that it remains to be decided whether or not Mr. Hill actually said such things, and therefore he does not have an opinion to state on the matter.\nOn Thursday, October 15, 1970, Georgia state representative from district ninety-four in Chatham county Bobby L. Hill, a practicing Savannah attorney, was arrested and jailed for contempt of court by Savannah Municipal Court judge Victor H. Mulling. Hill was representing six African American high school students who were arrested after interracial fighting broke out at newly-integrated Savannah High School. No white students were arrested in the incident. In trying the case, Judge Mulling noted that the defendants had not been issued correct warrants, and called a recess in order to reissue them. During this time, Hill allegedly notified his clients that they could not be held on illegal warrants, and were therefore not required to stay in court. As several of the defendants attempted to leave the courtroom, they were stopped by deputies with blackjacks; the sight of this scene caused the entire courtroom to break out in disorder. For his alleged role in the courtroom disturbance, Hill was held in Chatham County Jail for four days. While Hill's attorneys requested his release on bond, several demonstrations were held in protest of his incarceration, including marches on the Chatham County Jail, which attracted hundreds of demonstrators. In defiance of the demonstrations, Judge Mulling refused to rule on the bond motion for Hill. Hill's attorneys filed a petition for habeas corpus in Superior Court; they were granted a hearing, but could not immediately secure a bond for Hill's release. Ultimately, Hill was released on Tuesday, October 19, by order of U.S. District Court judge Alexander A. Lawrence.\nTitle supplied by cataloger.\nThe Civil Rights Digital Library received support from a National Leadership Grant for Libraries awarded to the University of Georgia by the Institute of Museum and Library Services for digital conversion and description of the WSB-TV Newsfilm Collection.\n|Types:||Moving images | News | Unedited footage|\n|Subjects:||Hill, Bobby L.

{"question":"How can I calculate the maximum cable length between an outdoor antenna and a repeater using an i-Repeater device?","answer":"To calculate the maximum cable length using an i-Repeater: 1) Take a yagi antenna, i-repeater, and power source to the roof. 2) Point the Yagi at the nearest suitable tower. 3) Power on the i-repeater and connect the Yagi to the outdoor antenna port. 4) Press 'menu' on the LCD and click on 'dB page' to see the 'Total loss' values. For 2100MHz signals, divide the Total loss dB figure by 0.2 (the loss per meter in SD400 cable) to get the maximum length. For example, if total loss is 16dB at 2100MHz, the maximum cable length would be 16/0.2 = 80 meters.","context":["How do we find out precisely the maximum length of cable you can install between the outdoor antenna and the repeater?\nIn all the Stelladoradus repeater kits we provide a standard 15m length of cable to be installed between the outdoor antenna and the repeater. This is satisfactory for most customers.\nHowever, sometimes it would be useful to install a longer length of cable instead. Perhaps the roof is far away from the area where you would like mobile coverage, and you need to install a long cable. In many professional installations, this is the case.\nNow, we have a method with which you can use to calculate this maximum length more accurately. In many cases, you will find this length to be much greater then 15m.\nThe key tool you will need is an i-Repeater. The i-Repeater has an LCD screen that will tell you the “total loss” figure in dB’s for each frequency. Once you know this, it is easy to calculate maximum cable length.\nGo to the roof with a yagi antenna, an i-repeater, and a power source for the i-repeater.\nPoint the Yagi at the nearest suitable tower.\nPower on the i-repeater and attach the Yagi to the outdoor antenna port.\nOn the LCD, press “menu” and Click on “dB page”. Take a note of the “Total loss” values for each frequency.\nAnalyzing the data:\nThese “total loss ” values are the amount of attenuation the repeater is applying to the signal due to the signal being too strong.\nYou should focus on the highest frequency that you intend to provide in this installation\nIf you are installing an LG repeater (800MHz, 900MHz ), then you only need to focus on 900MHz.\nIf you are installing a GDW system (900,1800,2100mhz), then you will need to focus on 2100MHz.\nRULE: it is more difficult to get the higher frequencies to travel through air and cable.\n2100MHz will be more attenuated in cable than 900MHz, so designing a system that incorporates 2100MHz (or 2600MHz) is going to be more challenging, and you will find your maximum cable length will need to be shorter.\nLooking at the example in the image above, we see a total loss dB of 16dB at 2100MHz.\nThis is a large value for 2100MHz and would be typically be the case in urban areas.\nAs we intend to install a GDW system (W=2100MHz), we need to focus on 2100MHz.\nRULE: There is a loss of 0.2dB per meter at 2100MHz in SD400 cable(standard cable we supply).\nSo we divide our Total loss dB figure by 0.2 to get our maximum cable length: 16 / 0.2 = 80\nSo, we can use an 80m length of cable between the outdoor antenna and the repeater.\n80m is far better then the specified 15m. This is very useful if you need to get the signal deep into a building. (You will probably not need a pre-amp)\nWhat if the db loss value is zero?\nTheoretically, in this case, we should have a zero length piece of cable between the Yagi and the repeater. However, this is not practical, so we have to accept some loss.\nThis is why we specify a 15m cable in our repeater kits, so as to ensure we do not have too much loss in the case of a weak mobile signal outside on the roof of the building.\nWe have a new online repeater design tool.

{"question":"How do macronutrients and micronutrients differ in their required quantities and roles in human nutrition?","answer":"Macronutrients and micronutrients differ significantly in their required amounts and functions. Macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats) are required in large amounts to provide energy for maintaining body functions and daily activities. In fact, most of the estimated 25 tonnes of food consumed in a lifetime falls into the macronutrient category. In contrast, micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) are needed only in small amounts, though they are essential for health and wellbeing. While macronutrients serve as primary energy sources and building blocks, micronutrients play crucial roles in various bodily processes and are mainly obtained from fruits, vegetables, grains, meats, and dairy products.","context":["We all eat food because it provides the fundamental types of materials required to keep our bodies functioning.\nThese materials can be categorised as:\n- macronutrients – carbohydrates, proteins, fats and oils\n- micronutrients – vitamins and minerals\n- dietary fibre – cellulose, pectin and gums\n- dietary water – keeping the body hydrated\n- phytochemicals – biologically active compounds from fruits and vegetables.\nIt has been estimated that an average person consumes 25 tonnes of food within their lifetime, and most of that food sits in the macronutrient category.\nMacronutrients are required in large amounts to provide the energy needed to maintain body functions and carry out the activities of daily life. There are three macronutrients – carbohydrates, proteins and fats.\nMicronutrients are substances such as vitamins and minerals that are necessary dietary components. Although needed in only small amounts, they are essential for health and wellbeing.\nWe look at what vitamins and minerals are and the role that selected examples play in keeping the body in a healthy state, in particular, vitamin C.\nDietary fibre is that portion of the food we eat that is resistant to digestion and absorption in the small intestine.

The questions support an inquiry approach.\nFor explanations of key concepts, see Food function and structure – key terms.\nThis timeline traces the history of scurvy, the discovery of a cure for the disease and the isolation and identification of ascorbic acid known also as vitamin C.","Nutrients. How would you define them? You know they are in food, they’re what makes food “nutritious,” but what does it really mean? How important are they, and how do we know if we’re getting enough?\nNutrient comes from a latin word literally meaning “to feed or nourish”. They are the components of food that help our bodies survive and grow. Nutrients are categorized into macronutrients, the large building blocks of food, and micronutrients, the smaller, but equally important, building blocks.\nThe three primary macronutrients are carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. You might be familiar with these because they are commonly mentioned in different diet trends.\nCarbohydrates are the body’s main source of fuel. They are necessary for the healthy functioning of our brains, hearts, and all other organs. Carbohydrates are further categorized as simple carbohydrates and complex carbohydrates. Simple carbohydrates, such as sugar, are broken down into glucose and absorbed much faster than complex carbohydrates, such as oatmeal. Dietitians recommend trying to make the majority of carbohydrates intake complex carbohydrates.\nProtein has many roles in the body, primarily providing energy, aiding in growth and development while also regulating many processes. Protein plays an important role in building muscle tissue and protein itself is made of building blocks called amino acids. There are nine essential amino acids: Isoleucine, Phenylalanine, Lysine, Leucine, Threonine, Valine, Tryptophan, Methionine, and Histidine. You can commonly get these from animal protein sources, however, it can be harder for vegans and vegetarians to find plant protein sources with all nine essential amino acids.\nFats aid in the absorption of nutrients, play a role in growth and development, and provide energy too. Some vitamins (A,D,E, and K,) require fats for absorption. There are a few different kinds of dietary fats: monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, saturated, and trans fats. Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are “healthy fats” because they can lower cholesterol and risk for heart disease. You can get these healthy fats from foods like fish, nuts, oils, and avocados. Saturated fats have been associated with increased risk for disease and are recommended to be consumed in moderation. Trans fats should be avoided as they are strongly associated with increased disease risk.\nMicronutrients are vitamins and minerals: trace elements in the food and earth that are essential in the processes of our body that allow us to function.

{"question":"What are the differences between weak, mixed, and strong declensions in German grammar?","answer":"The weak declension is used with definite articles and serves as the foundation. Mixed declension occurs with indefinite articles, where German forces echoes of its definite articles into the adjectives and articles. For example, in 'Ein alter man,' the 'r' comes from 'der,' the masculine nominative definite article. Strong declension is used when there's no article at all. German imposes these declension patterns firmly, though there can be some ambiguity in certain cases, particularly with neuter and masculine in genitive case, and feminine in genitive and dative cases.","context":["or, \"NADGe, I soaked in it!\"\nNADGe stands for Nominative, Accusative, Dative, and Genitive. These are the cases German makes use of, though one might argue the Dative is slowly ringing the death knell of the Genitive. Not sure what we mean by \"cases\"? Go read up on wikipedia: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_case\nPut simply, cases describe changes to nouns in your sentences depending on what role they're playing. Here's a dirty little secret about English: we have vestigial case markers that turn up in a few odd places, too:\nAs English speakers, we're more comfortable using word order and prepositional phrases to identify case, but if you cringe when someone uses an 'I' when it should be \"me\", as in \"for you and I,\" then welcome home, friend. This site is for you. If you think me and I should be interchangeable because rhyming! … forget it, you never got this far down the page.\nThe pattern of changing the definite article or the endings on adjectives specifically identifies (in many cases, but not all) whether each noun in the sentence is serving as the subject or direct or indirect object. If you skip these declensions or get them mixed up, people will still probably figure out what you mean, but you won't sound competent. \"The baker sold me to a pretzel\" is pretty clearly wrong from context, even though they'll know what you mean. But what about in this case? \"The old lady suggested the young trainee to the boss\"? Get the roles wrong in that sentence, and confusion reigns. Or rains. Or reins.\nSo here's how to decline…\n…with a definite article (weak declension)\n…with an indefinite article (mixed declension)\n…with no article at all (strong declension)\nBut who talks like that? Who walks around in Germany spouting morphology tables?\nLet's put some meat on them bones.\nwith a definite article (weak declension)\n|masculine||der alte Mann||den alten Mann||dem alten Mann||des alten Mannes\ndes alten Manns\n|neuter||das interessante Buch||das interessante Buch||dem interessanten Buch||des interessante Buches\ndes interessanten Buchs\n|feminine||die großzügige Frau||die großzügige Frau||der großzügigen Frau||der großzügigen Frau|\n|plurals||die schlechten Nachrichten||die schlechten Nachrichten||den schlechten Nachrichten||der schlechten Nachrichten|\nDer alte Mann hat die schlechten Nachrichten des interessanten Buchs der großzügigen Frau weitergegeben.\nOK. Even here it's not really clear if the generous woman is the recipient or the author. So you'll still need context sometimes. Or prepositions to sort of mitigate German's unbridled caseyness. Use the weak declension (the with the definite articles) as the foundation upon which we will build the mixed and strong declension models.\nEin alter man hat keine schlechten Nachrichten eines interessanten Buchs einer großzügigen Frau weitergegeben.\nI think of it as German imposing its will on the words. It really likes weak declension and if you insist on using indefinite expressions, well, then German will force at least some echoes of its definitive articles into the adjectives and articles:\nEin alter man — that 'r' is from der, the masculine nominative definite article.\nhat keine schlechten Nachrichten — that 'e' is from die, the plural accusative definite article.\neines interessanten Buchs — those 'es' and 's' are from des, the neuter genitive definite article.\neiner großzügigen Frau weitergegeben. — that 'er' is from der, the feminine dative definite article. Or is the genitive here, too? Only context can tell you.\nThese rules are really firm. There is potential for ambiguity, since\n- neuter and masculine decline the same way in the genitive — so the gender isn't obvious if you don't already know it, and\n- feminine declines the same way in the genitive and dative —so you don't know, apart from context, whether the feminine word is an indirect object or acting as a possession of another element in the sentence, and\n- weak declension of plurals in the Dative form looks just like the Accusative form of masculine — which is tricky only in situations where the Dative plural looks the same as the Accusative masculine form (it already ends in \"n\" and isn't umlautable) and the verb could take a direct object or an indirect object. Certainly context will help here, too.\nBut apart from these edge cases , with a solid footing on the NADGe, you can identify permutations that can never be (and therefore avoid them) and deduce genders of unknown words. And pulling that off in casual conversation makes you sound like you know what you're talking about, giving the Germans less inclination to interrupt you and switch to English, thereby depriving you of your chance to practice."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:02a32d8b-4b5b-46d8-86e6-79a45925f5d3>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm learning about music history. How different were the styles of Jimmie Rodgers and the Carter Family, who both started recording country music in the 1920s?","answer":"Jimmie Rodgers and the Carter Family had quite distinct styles despite both being early country music stars. The Carter Family focused on folk music from the British Isles, church music, and harmonious singing, with A.P. Carter collecting folk songs and performing them with his wife Sarah and sister-in-law Maybelle using instruments like guitar and autoharp. In contrast, Jimmie Rodgers developed his characteristic sound by blending traditional work songs, blues, hobo music, and cowboy songs with his trademark 'Blue Yodel.' Rodgers learned his blues techniques from African American railroad workers and created a unique style that incorporated yodeling, which involves rapid changes between chest and head voice registers. His first hit record 'Blue Yodel' sold nearly half a million copies in 1927 and sparked a national craze for yodeling in the United States.","context":["Wednesday, November 18, 2015\nYodeling had its origins in the call from mountain to mountain, the communication from Alp to Alp. It is a form of singing that involves singing with repeated changes in pitch from the chest register to the head register without using words that mean anything. It was in mountainous and inaccessible regions that natural yodeling communication forms developed in order to communicate from one hill to the other or to bring in the cows.\nAlpine yodeling was a longtime rural tradition in Europe, and became popular in the 1830s as an entertainment in theaters and music halls. In the United States, traveling minstrels were yodeling in the 1800s and in 1920 the Victor Recording Company listed 17 yodels in their catalog. Music historians credit the first country recording to include yodeling to Riley Puckett in 1924.\nIn 1928, blending Alpine yodeling with traditional work, blues, hobo, and cowboy music, Jimmie Rodgers released his recording \"Blue Yodel No. 1\". Rodger's Blue Yodel created an instant national craze for yodeling in the United States and, according to a black musician who lived near Rodgers in Mississippi, everyone, both black and white alike, began to copy Rodgers. The popularity lasted through the 1940s, but by the 1950s it became rare to hear yodeling in Country or Western music.\nHuman voices have at least two distinct vocal registers, called the \"head\" and \"chest\" voices. Most people can sing tones within a certain range of lower pitches in their chest voice and tones within a certain range of higher pitch in their head voice. Falsetto is an \"unsupported\" register forcing vocal cords in a higher pitch without any head or chest voice air support. Experienced singers can control their voices in this range, easily switching between registers. Yodeling is a version of this technique in which a singer might change register several times in only a few seconds and at a high volume. Repeated alternation between registers at a singer's passaggio pitch range produces a very distinctive sound.\nBart Plantenga, author of Yodel-Ay-Ee-Oooo: The Secret History of Yodeling Around the World, explains the technique: It is thought that yodeling was first introduced to the United States by German immigrants in Pennsylvania in the early 1800s. As the new settlers traveled south through the Appalachian Mountains and beyond into the Deep South they came into contact with Scots-Irish immigrants, Scandinavians (practitioners of a unique yodeling called kölning), and other nationalities including African slaves who communicated with \"field hollers\"...a long, loud, musical shout, rising and falling and breaking into falsetto.\nIn 1839, the Tyrolese Minstrels toured the United States and started an American craze for Alpine music. During the 1840s, dozens of German, Swiss, and Austrian singing groups crisscrossed the country entertaining audiences with a combination of singing, yodeling, and Alpine harmony. The success of the European groups led to the formation of many American family singing groups as well. The most popular was the Hutchison Family Singers who toured, singing harmony and yodeling. Minstrel shows parodied the Hutchison's yodeling with their own, calling it \"Tyrolesian business\".\nIn 1853, Christy's Minstrels mocked the Hutchinson Family singing We Come From the Hills With Tyrolean Echo. Other traveling American minstrels were yodeling in the United States as well. Recordings of yodelers were made in 1892 and in 1920 the Victor Recording Company listed 17 yodels in their catalog, many of them by George Watson, the most successful yodeler of the time. In 1897 Watson recorded the song, \"Sleep, Baby, Sleep\" which was later recorded in 1927 by Riley Puckett as the second yodeling record ever made (the first was Rock All Our Babies to Sleep).\nSleep Baby Sleep was also the first song ever recorded by Jimmie Rodgers, the man would eventually come to be known as the father of both country music and American yodeling when he combined the yodel with southern African-American blues. By the 1880s the minstrel show had been replaced by Vaudeville and American Burlesque. By around 1905, more than 20 years before Jimmie Rodgers introduced his blue yodel, African Americans were touring the country singing and yodeling.\nThe most noted yodelers of that time were Monroe Tabor, known as The Yodeling Bellboy, though he was not a bellboy. Known as The Jolly Hendersons, Beulah Henderson toured with her husband Billy from 1905 through 1910. Billed as \"The Classy Colored Comedy Pair\", Beulah was featured as \"America's only Colored Lady Yodeler\". Black performer Charles Anderson began touring with a vaudeville show in 1909, singing a combination of blues and yodeling. In 1923 and 1924 Anderson recorded eight sides for the Okeh label which gave a summary account of his vaudeville repertoire during the previous decade. Five of the recorded songs were yodels.\nAnother famous early yodeler was The Singing Brakeman Jimmie Rodgers, who recorded dozens of popular songs in the late 1920s and early 1930s. While working on the railroad he learned blues techniques from African American gandy dancers, and eventually created his characteristic sound - a blend of traditional work, blues, hobo, and cowboy songs and his trademark \"Blue Yodel.\" According to a black musician who lived near Rodgers in Mississippi, everyone, both black and white alike, began to copy Rodgers.\nJack Guthrie, the cousin of Woody Guthrie, performed in the thirties and early forties. Known as \"Oklahoma's Yodeling Cowboy\", he developed a style of singing and yodeling influenced by his idol, Jimmie Rodgers, and his experiences as a bucking-horse rider and rodeo performer. Hank Snow was one of the great country legends of the 1950s, but he had actually been singing in Canada for years where he was known as \"The Yodeling Ranger\". He admired Jimmie Rodgers as well, and learned to yodel by listening to his records.\nThe DeZurik Sisters were two of the first women to become stars on both the National Barn Dance and the Grand Ole Opry, largely a result of their original yodeling style. Singing cowboy Roy Rogers yodeled, as did his box office competitor Gene Autry.\nYodeler Bill Haley of Bill Haley and the Comets has one of the strangest histories of all. Bill Haley zoomed to fame as the \"King of Rock and Roll\" when his song \"Rock Around the Clock\" was featured in the popular film Blackboard Jungle. But it is little-known that Haley and his band had been around for years doing Western swing music with Haley featured as a yodeler. At one point in the 1940s, Bill Haley was even awarded Indiana State Yodeling Champion for his skill, perhaps something that his skillful manager Colonel Tom Parker felt not important to mention to his screaming teenage rock 'n' roll fans.\nSlim Whitman performed for over 60 years. Whitman avoided the \"down on yer luck\" songs, preferring instead to sing laid-back romantic melodies about simple life and love. Critics dubbed his musical style \"countrypolitan,\" due to its fusion of country music and a more sophisticated crooner vocal style.\nWant to learn how to yodel?

It developed in the southeastern states of the USA as a mix of folk music from the British Isles, church music and African American blues. It was played on instruments like acoustic guitar, mandolin, autoharp, fiddle and the banjo. Old-time music was first recorded in the 1920s, with recordings of the Carter Family becoming the most popular. A. P. Carter collected folk songs and also wrote new songs, and he sang them in harmony with his guitar-playing sister-in-law Maybelle and his wife Sarah, who also played autoharp. Songs like Can The Circle Be Unbroken (By and By) and Wildwood Flower became hit records, and the Carter Family became the first stars of country music.\nJimmie Rodgers, another of country music's earliest stars, was recorded at the same recording sessions as the Carters. Jimmie was taught how to play guitar and sing blues and work chants by African Americans in railroad gangs in which he worked. He also heard old-time music and folk songs and combined all these styles in his own songs. He often used a vocal technique called yodelling, and his first hit record, Blue Yodel, sold nearly half a million copies in 1927.\nCountry Music 1930 - 1960\nBefore television, American families often sat together and listened to the radio. One of the most popular programs was a live country-music variety show called the \"Grand Ole Opry\". It was broadcast from Nashville, Tennessee, which had become the centre of the country-music business. Listeners heard old-time music as well as another style called Western music. This style often had horse-like clip-clop rhythms and songs about lovesick cowboys and gun-fighting outlaws. Western music became popular in the 1930s and 40s when singing cowboys began appearing in Hollywood cowboy movies called \"Westerns\". Singing cowboys like Gene Autry and Roy Rogers became huge country-music stars, and Nashville executives decided the cowboy image was better for country music than the hillbilly image of old-time music. They renamed the genre \"Country and Western music\" and began dressing their musicians in cowboy clothes.\nMeanwhile, a style of Western dance music called Western swing became popular in Texas, Oklahoma and California. Western swing bands used amplified instruments like pedal steel guitar to create music loud enough to be heard in large dance halls. Their music was a lively mix of Western country music and swing jazz, and one of the most popular bands was Bob Wills and The Texas Playboys. Another style called rockabilly developed when Western swing bands began playing R&B songs as well as country songs. When singers like Elvis Presley heard this new mix of country music and R&B, they formed rockabilly bands with acoustic guitar, electric guitar, stand-up bass and drums. Elvis had several rockabilly hits early in his career, as did Carl Perkins, Roy Orbison and Johnny Cash. Cash became one of country music's biggest artists in the 60s when he combined the sounds of rockabilly with those of honky tonk. He soon became known as the \"man in black\" because he wore black clothes instead of cowboy clothes, as did Roy Orbison who wore dark sunglasses as well to complete his look.\nHonky tonk music first developed in the 1940s in working-class honky tonk bars near the oil fields of Texas. Honky tonk bands usually included acoustic guitar, pedal steel guitar, fiddle, stand-up bass and drums, and honky tonk songs were often about loneliness, love, heartbreak and pain. Working-class people could relate to these songs, especially those of country music's greatest singer-songwriter, Hank Williams. Hank drank too much, had a difficult relationship with his wife Audrey, and died at 29. But in his short, troubled life he wrote hundreds of beautiful, powerful songs, many of which have become country-music standards like Lovesick Blues, Cold, Cold Heart and I Saw The Light. Other important artists include Ernest Tubb, Lefty Frizzell and Jean Shepard. The honky tonk sound has often been revived when country music has become too commercial and fans want a more authentic sound.\nAnother style called bluegrass developed in the early 1950s. It was a revival of old-time country music led by Bill Monroe and the Blue Grass Boys. In the 70s, the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band became popular, and since the mid-80s the most successful bluegrass artist has been Alison Krauss.\nLater Country Music\nIn the mid-1950s, record companies in Nashville were losing sales to rock and roll and soul artists who topped the charts. To compete, Nashville producers created a new style that would appeal to white adults who didn't like rock and roll or soul, but didn't usually buy country records either. They found singers with smooth voices and had them sing sweet ballads over orchestral strings and choirs. Authentic country instruments like fiddle, guitar and banjo weren't often used, and the plan worked. Sales of records from Nashville companies soon began to increase, especially for artists like Jim Reeves and Patsy Cline.\nBut many artists weren't happy about what Nashville was doing to country music, and in the early 60s these artists developed a new style that combined the authentic country-music sounds of honky tonk with the rebellious attitude of rockabilly. Merle Haggard, Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings and Kris Kristofferson were some of the most important artists in what's now called outlaw country, and many people loved their music. Songs like Johnny Cash's Ring of Fire, Merle Haggard's Mama Tried and Kris Kristofferson's Sunday Mornin' Comin' Down became huge hits, and country music was saved once again.\nAnother style called country rock began to develop in the mid-60s. Gram Parsons created some of the earliest country rock when he added rock and roll piano, rock guitar and elements of folk rock to his band's country-music sound. The style developed further when Gram worked with the Byrds and then the Flying Burrito Brothers. Bob Dylan also began mixing elements of country music into his folk rock sound in the mid-60s. Dylan had been writing poetic folk songs since the early 60's, especially protest songs like Blowin' in the Wind and A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall. When he switched from acoustic to electric guitar in 1965, his sound moved closer to rock. But he didn't make a real country-rock album until 1969 when he recorded the album Nashville Skyline with country musicians like Johnny Cash. In the 70s, artists like New Riders of the Purple Sage, Emmylou Harris, Linda Ronstadt and Neil Young developed the style further.\nAnother style that appeared in the 60s was country pop. In the early 60s, former rockabilly singer Roy Orbison began producing some of the best pop records ever made by a country-music artist. Orbison's voice was one of the most emotionally powerful in all of popular music, and he had a major influence on many later artists. In the late 60s and early 70s country pop artists like Glen Campbell, Dolly Parton and Kenny Rogers had many hit records, and female artists like Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, Carrie Underwood and Taylor Swift have been successful more recently.\nCountry music styles, artists and albums\n- Old-time Music: The Carter Family -

Two of the films being shown this evening are The Yakuza and Ryan’s Daughter. The former is one of the disappointingly few TCM premieres this month. (See TCM’s Robert Mitchum movie schedule further below.)\nDespite his film noir background, Robert Mitchum was a somewhat unusual choice to star in The Yakuza (1975), a crime thriller set in the Japanese underworld. Ryan’s Daughter or no, Mitchum hadn’t been a box office draw in quite some time; in the mid-1970s, one would have expected a Warner Bros. release directed by Sydney Pollack – who had recently handled the likes of Jane Fonda, Barbra Streisand, and Robert Redford – to star someone like Jack Nicholson or Al Pacino or Dustin Hoffman. But Robert Mitchum it was.\nIn fact, as found in Lee Server’s Robert Mitchum: “Baby, I Don’t Care,” Mitchum – with director approval – was cast after Lee Marvin turned down the role and before Pollack was hired. Robert Aldrich was supposed to handle the proceedings (he and Marvin had worked together on The Dirty Dozen), but Mitchum nixed the idea.* He selected the Jeremiah Johnson and The Way We Were director instead.\nFour-time Japanese Academy Award winner Ken Takakura, who has been described as the Japanese Humphrey Bogart, was Mitchum’s co-star, while Eiji Okada, Emmanuelle Riva’s romantic interest in Alain Resnais’ Hiroshima Mon Amour (1959) and the star of Hiroshi Teshigahara’s Woman in the Dunes (1964), landed a supporting role.\nAs mentioned in the Mitchum biography, upon his arrival in Japan in January 1974 the Hollywood star held a small press conference during which he told local journalists, “Remember Pearl Harbor.”\nIt’s unclear whether the Japanese journalists found that humorous or if they replied back, “Remember Hiroshima and Nagasaki.” (Seventy years ago earlier this month.)\nMitchum also threw tantrums during the shoot – “I want out. I really want out. Perhaps the only way they will believe me is if I pack my bags and get out of here tomorrow. … Greta Garbo did it. …” – and had to deal with autograph hunters calling him “Kirk Douglas-san.”†\nWith a screenplay by Paul Schrader (Taxi Driver) and Yakuza-experienced Leonard Schrader (Kiss of the Spider Woman), later revised by credited co-screenwriter Robert Towne (Chinatown), The Yakuza should have been if not a box office hit, then at least a critically acclaimed effort.\nAt the time of its release, Pollack’s film was neither. In later years, The Yakuza has developed a cult following, though it remains little known outside the circle of gangster film aficionados.\nAbout working with Robert Mitchum, Sydney Pollack would later say: “I found him to be like a very, very powerful and lazy horse. He wants to walk as slow as possible and get away with doing as little as possible. You used to really have to push him. He won’t offer the full emotional nature of a performance, at least he didn’t for me, until you went after him a little bit.”\n* According to several online sources (I was unable to trace their original source), Robert Mitchum didn’t want to work with Robert Aldrich again, as he remembered his experience with the director during the making of The Angry Hills (1959). Besides The Dirty Dozen, Aldrich is best known for the Bette Davis-Joan Crawford star vehicle What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?.\n† Robert Mitchum and Sydney Pollack quotes, “Kirk Douglas-san” via Robert Mitchum: “Baby, I Don’t Care.” Server’s sources for these two particular bits of information aren’t explicitly divulged in the book, but in that segment he quotes extensively The Yakuza assistant director Michael Moore.\nBack in the 1940s and early 1950s, David Lean was known for several first-rate intimate dramas – e.g., This Happy Breed, Brief Encounter, The Passionate Friends, Hobson’s Choice – featuring top-notch performances by the likes of Ann Todd (Lean’s wife from 1949-1957), Celia Johnson, Claude Rains, Charles Laughton, and John Mills. What a difference a multiple Oscar winner like The Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) makes.\nFollowing that hugely successful, big-budget Anglo-American release, Lean never looked back. First, there was the even more mammoth Lawrence of Arabia (1962) and then the leviathanesque Doctor Zhivago (1965); both were enormous international hits.\n‘Madame Bovary’ reboot\nNext in line was an intimate drama – a Madame Bovary reboot written by Robert Bolt (Lawrence of Arabia, A Man for All Seasons) – filmed as if it were another bloated epic: Ryan’s Daughter (1970).\nLean’s ham-fisted approach and the film’s inordinate length are both major handicaps to the delicate, complex story about love, betrayal, and social pressure in British-occupied Ireland at the time of World War I. Admittedly, these issues were hardly new in a David Lean film as they had also plagued Doctor Zhivago and, to a lesser extent, Lawrence of Arabia – both of which earned multiple Academy Award nominations, including Best Picture and Best Director. Lawrence of Arabia, in fact, came out on top in both categories in addition to five others, and is considered by many one of the greatest movies ever made.\nSarah Miles, Robert Mitchum at their best\nRyan’s Daughter, for its part, is saved from a fate worse than death by a solid second half and a first-rate cast:\n- Robert Bolt’s wife Sarah Miles, one of the most remarkable (and most underused) British actresses of the ’60s (The Servant, Blow-Up), delivers what may well be the most complex performance of her career. Miles was nominated for the Best Actress Oscar, but lost to Glenda Jackson in Ken Russell’s Women in Love.\n- Robert Mitchum (instead of original choice Paul Scofield), whom I generally find much more effective as “soft” or “weak” men than as cynical tough guys. Hired for $870,000, Mitchum plays the older, sedate husband of Sarah Miles, who has been having an affair with young and handsome British soldier Christopher Jones. I should add that the film’s director and its male lead did not get along. And that Mitchum’s behavior toward Sarah Miles – as described in one of her autobiographies – could have gotten him sued for sexual harassment today. (Widespread rumors notwithstanding, Miles has asserted she did not have an affair with her co-star.)\n- Veteran John Mills, who had previously worked with Lean in In Which We Serve (1942), This Happy Breed (1944), Great Expectations (1946) and Hobson’s Choice (1954). Mills fully deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his portrayal of the local “village idiot” – a performance some find offensive.\nChristopher Jones looks the part of the handsome British officer (written for Marlon Brando), but apparently didn’t sound it; his voice was dubbed by Stanley Holloway’s son, Julian Holloway – who possibly would have had to dub Brando as well.\nIn later years, Jones blamed his less than effective performance on his personal life, claiming he was having an affair with Sharon Tate, who was going to leave Roman Polanski for him. Tate was murdered in Aug. 1969, while Ryan’s Daughter was in production.\nAlthough a box office success in the U.K. and the U.S., the costly Ryan’s Daughter had a tough time earning its money back. The film won only two Oscars: John Mills’ and Best Cinematography for Freddie Young.\nBesides Sarah Miles’, its only other nomination was for Best Sound.\nSix films, five Best Director Oscar nods\nDavid Lean’s last six films earned him five Best Director Academy Award nominations. Two of these resulted in victories: The Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia. The one movie for which Lean was bypassed by the Academy’s Directors Branch? Ryan’s Daughter.\nThe five nominees that year, by the way, were a mix of traditional and unconventional filmmakers:\n- Robert Altman for MASH.\n- Federico Fellini for Fellini Satyricon.\n- Winner Franklin J. Schaffner for Patton.\n- Arthur Hiller for Love Story.\n- Ken Russell for Women in Love.\nFor the record, David Lean’s three other latter-career Best Director Oscar nominations were for the aforementioned Doctor Zhivago, Summertime (1955), and, my favorite among his psychological epics, A Passage to India (1984).\nLean had been previously nominated in that category for Brief Encounter (1946) and Great Expectations (1947).\nRobert Mitchum movies: TCM schedule (PT)\n6:15 AM THE SUNDOWNERS (1960).

{"question":"How do the Electricity Infrastructure Investment Act and the Oven Mountain project contribute differently to NSW's transition from coal to renewable energy?","answer":"The Electricity Infrastructure Investment Act 2020 provides the legal and policy framework by establishing renewable energy zones (REZs) and attracting $32 billion in private investment by 2030. It coordinates investment in new generation, storage, and network infrastructure as NSW transitions from coal power stations. Meanwhile, the Oven Mountain project is a specific 600MW/7200MWh pumped hydro facility that would provide large-scale storage capabilities within the New England REZ. The project would help stabilize the grid by pumping water uphill when renewable generation is high and releasing it through turbines when generation drops, supporting the integration of wind and solar power.","context":["The Electricity Infrastructure Investment Act 2020 (NSW) (the Act), described as the most ambitious energy plan in the country, has been passed by both houses of the NSW Parliament and received assent on 3 December 2020.\nThe purpose of the Act is to co-ordinate investment in new generation, storage and network infrastructure in NSW. The Act gives effect to the NSW Government’s Electricity Infrastructure Roadmap, which sets out the policy framework for investment to deliver a modern electricity system and maintain an affordable, reliable, clean and sustainable electricity supply in NSW as the State transitions from coal to renewable generated power.\nThe Act represents a fundamental shift in policy towards the encouragement of renewable energy projects in NSW and is targeted at reducing investment risk and providing industry and investors with the certainty they need in relation to new energy infrastructure.\nIt is projected that the “whole-of-system approach” under the Act will attract $32 billion of private sector investment by 2030 and secure NSW’s future as an “energy superpower”.\nWhy was the Act required?\nA large portion of the existing infrastructure which provides NSW’s energy supply is nearing the end of its technical life, with four of the five coal-fired power stations in the State being scheduled to close in the next 15 years, starting from 2023. These power stations must be replaced by new energy infrastructure before they are closed to avoid substantial price rises.\nIt has been recognised that NSW has some of the best renewable energy and pumped hydro resources in the world. However, the view of the NSW Government is that the State has not been able to take advantage of these resources due to congestion in the transmission system, which resulted in limited capacity to connect new generation. Further, it was identified that there was no clear pathway under the existing regulatory and market framework for co-ordinated investment across different types of energy infrastructure to deliver the necessary investment at the scale and in the timeframe required.\nThe framework under the Act has therefore sought to alleviate these issues, opening up the opportunity for the renewables sector to invest in energy generation and storage in order to meet the future energy needs of NSW.\nThe framework in the Act for investment in generation, storage and network infrastructure includes the following main components:\n- monitoring an energy security target for electricity supply each year;\n- “renewable energy zones” (REZs) in specified geographical areas of NSW that are made up of particular generation, storage and network infrastructure;\n- construction and operation of network infrastructure in NSW (including in REZs);\n- cost recovery in respect of the construction and operation of network infrastructure;\n- derivative arrangements for persons who construct and operate generation, storage and firming infrastructure; and\n- contributions from distribution network service providers.\nCertain provisions in the Act commenced by proclamation on 9 December 2020, with the remaining provisions to commence on 1 May 2021 and 1 July 2021.\nRenewable Energy Zones\nThe central feature of the Act is the establishment of a process under which the Minister can declare a geographical area of the State a REZ and specify the generation, storage or network infrastructure that will be implemented in that zone.\nThe main function of a REZ is to enable the coordinated development of new grid infrastructure in energy rich areas to connect multiple generators in the same location. This approach is considered to create economies of scale, which could reduce generation costs, and will provide opportunities for early planning and community engagement.\nThere are 5 initial REZs declared in the Act, namely:\n- Central-West Orana;\n- New England;\n- South West; and\n- Hunter-Central Coast.\nThe Minister can also declare REZs on application, which enables the delivery of non-governmental led REZs. A declaration will involve a consideration of planning, environmental and heritage matters, as well as the views of the local community in the proposed REZ.\nThe Act gives power to the Minister to declare “access schemes” that operate in REZs. An access scheme authorises (or prohibits) access to, and the use of, specified network infrastructure by operators of generation and storage infrastructure within a REZ.\nThese access schemes are intended to support investment in the network and provide investors with comfort that their project will be authorised to access a stable grid connection.\nThe declaration of an access scheme may specify how access rights are to be conferred on participants and the fees payable. The fees under the scheme are envisaged to be applied towards the cost of the network infrastructure required to enable the REZ and for distribution to funds set up for the benefit of communities within the REZ.\nThe Minister may only amend a declaration in the very limited circumstances set out in the Act and may only repeal a declaration if there are no participants in the access scheme or in accordance with its terms.\nElectricity Infrastructure Investment Safeguard\nThe Act establishes an “electricity infrastructure investment safeguard” that includes:\n- legislative objectives set out in the Act for each type of new infrastructure (i.e. generation, long-duration storage and firming);\n- a process for the consumer trustee appointed under the Act to plan the development pathway to construct each type of new infrastructure; and\n- the ability for the consumer trustee to award “long term energy supply agreements” (LTES Agreements) through a competitive tender process, if the consumer trustee determines that such agreements are required to meet the development pathway.\nThe LTES Agreement is a derivative agreement under which long term energy supply operators (LTES Operators) will construct and operate infrastructure for eligible renewables and storage projects in return for periodic options to exercise financial derivative arrangements.\nThe intention of the LTES Agreement is to provide certainty to investors that the project can earn an agreed minimum level of revenue from selling its services to the electricity market and to provide a financial incentive for the development of projects to be accelerated so that they can be brought online quickly, which will enable a swifter build-out of REZs.\nElectricity Infrastructure Fund\nThe Act requires the scheme financial vehicle which is a party to the LTES Agreement to establish an “electricity infrastructure fund” to receive payments and cover the financial liabilities of the scheme financial vehicle and operations of the consumer trustee and regulator. Distribution network services providers are required to pay a specified contribution to the fund determined by the regulator each year. The fees payable by participants in access schemes are also required to be paid into the fund.\nEnergy Security Targets\nThe Act establishes an “energy security target” which is a mechanism to determine how much firm capacity is needed in NSW in the medium to long term to ensure the electricity system remains reliable. The energy security target under the Act is equivalent to the maximum demand experienced in NSW every 10 years, plus a reserve margin. An energy security target monitor will be appointed to calculate annual energy security targets and monitor whether or not the energy security target will be met in the next 10 years.\nConsiderations for Projects\n- Prohibitions – There is a risk that projects located in REZs which do not have a development consent under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW) for the proposed infrastructure could be prohibited from being connected to network infrastructure in a REZ. This can occur if the infrastructure planner under the Act (Energy Corporation of NSW) considers that there is significant opposition to the project from the local community. Developers should therefore consider engagement strategies with stakeholders as early as possible and spend time genuinely engaging with communities to build and maintain local support for the project.\n- Compliance – There are offences in the Act for failure to comply with its provisions, including for providing false and misleading information to the entities appointed under the Act. Penalty notices can be issued and financial penalties imposed for breaches of certain provisions in the Act. Fines under the Act apply to businesses, individuals and network operators. Parties involved in the energy sector must therefore be aware of their obligations and liabilities under the Act.\n- Incentives – Developers should consider the impact of the Act on their business, including how to structure their proposed projects and tenders in order to maximise the potential benefits to revenue that could flow from the financial derivative arrangements under the proposed LETS Agreements.\nFor further information, please contact Adela Smith or Tim Kennedy.","Oven Mountain pumped hydro planned for future renewable energy zone\nThe Oven Mountain pumped hydro project could help to unlock the potential of the New England renewable energy zone.\nARENA is providing $951,000 in funding for the Oven Mountain Pumped Hydro project to explore how a 600MW/7200MWh storage facility could benefit the renewable energy zone being developed in northern New South Wales.\nA site situated between Armidale and Kempsey has been selected for its unique topography. First considered for a pumped hydro facility in the 1990s, the site features two natural granite reservoirs separated by a height differential of 600 metres, located approximately 2.5 kilometres apart.\nThe natural formations would allow water to be pumped up to the higher reservoir when solar and wind generation are high, then be released through a turbine to produce electricity when generation drops or demand rises.\nThe $2.2 million study will explore how the large storage facility could support the network in an area that has potential to become a hub for renewable generation.\nThe project will include an assessment of how the new energy storage could improve system strength and unlock constraints in the network. That could not only allow more wind and solar farms to be connected, but also reduce the marginal loss factors that are affecting revenues for existing renewable generators.\nMore storage needed as energy transition advances\nBuilding more storage to address these challenges will be vital as more renewable energy comes online and traditional generators are retired.\nAccording to an ‘Insights” paper released by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO) in mid 2019, more than 15 GW of storage will need to be in place by 2040. This storage will be needed to achieve the vision AEMO is working towards through its Integrated Systems Plan, which forecasts Australia’s generation to be dominated by large scale solar PV and wind within two decades.\nWhile there are a range of energy storage technologies emerging, pumped hydro is predicted to play a major role due to its capacity to supply large amounts of energy over a long duration.\nThe Oven Mountain project is one of a number of energy storage projects to receive ARENA support, under its focus on integrating renewables into the electricity network.\nARENA CEO Darren Miller said the study will provide knowledge about the role pumped hydro can play in the development of renewable energy zones.\n“Pumped hydro projects like Oven Mountain can play a key role in the provision of firming up and balancing the grid as increased levels of variable renewable energy generation such as wind and solar come online,” Mr Miller said.\n“Renewable Energy Zones like New England are sunny and windy areas with natural renewable energy resources, but they may be in weak areas of the grid. Pumped hydro can provide system security services like frequency and voltage support and it can provide bulk energy storage to help meet the evening peak,” he said.\nWhile the technology that underpins pumped hydro is not new, there are only a handful of sites operating around Australia.\nTo help make pumped hydro storage commercially viable as the transition to renewable energy advances, ARENA has supported the Snowy 2.0 feasibility study, Tasmania’s plan to become the ‘battery of the nation’, and the feasibility assessment of repurposing an old gold mine in North Queensland.\nBig names back Oven Mountain study\nAlinta Energy is partnering on the Oven Mountain study, which will be supported by consultants Lloyd’s Register, SMEC and EY.\nExecutive Director of Merchant Energy at Alinta, Ken Woolley, said “What we really like about this project is its potential to pair with low cost renewables to help us deliver more affordable and reliable energy for our customers,” Woolley said.\nIn 2017 the project was awarded a grant through the NSW Government’s Emerging Energy Program, which supports the development of innovative, large-scale electricity and storage projects.\nOven Mountain Pumped Storage Director Dr Jeremy Moon said the New England renewable energy zone is strategically positioned near the border of Queensland and New South Wales.\n“Pumped hydro technology evolution can support Australia’s generation transition. With its natural high hydrological head over a distance of around two kilometres, the Oven Mountain site allows for highly responsive synchronous machines to provide grid stability services that have traditionally been provided by fossil fuel generation.”\n“We are excited for the opportunity to work with ARENA to demonstrate how pumped hydro can provide large scale storage and support the New England Renewable Energy Zone, networks, system security and increasing levels of low cost, dispatchable power,” he said."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5759420c-dab5-409e-85aa-b949979fc8d4>","<urn:uuid:04d7cbb7-a73c-4426-9177-a202824b5c37>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As an art history student, I'm curious about both the physical creation process of Orthodox icons and their spiritual significance in churches. Could you explain how they're made and what they symbolize?","answer":"Orthodox icons are created through an elaborate process that begins with carefully selected wood (cypress in Greece, birch and oak in Russia). The wood is stored for 5-6 years to remove moisture, then treated with gesso (chalk). A draughtsman sketches the outline in charcoal, which is then painted over in black. The background and clothing are painted first, followed by gold ornamentation and finally the faces, which require the most precise skill. The icon is finished with a linseed or olive oil varnish. Spiritually, icons serve multiple purposes in Orthodox churches: they embellish the church's beauty, instruct members in doctrine, remind the faithful of their beliefs, and most importantly, serve as a conduit for prayer and worship. They are arranged in churches to create a symbolic microcosm of the universe, representing the plan of eternal salvation. The iconostasis (icon screen) in particular features Christ, the Virgin Mary, and John the Baptist, with the faithful giving these icons 'honorable reverence' during services through rituals like censing and kissing the icons.","context":["Our Planned Iconography Project\nWhen Prince Vladimir the Great (Saint Vladimir of Kiev) was seeking a religion for his people, the pagan Kievan Rus, he sent emissaries to study and report on the religious traditions of all his neighbor countries.\nWhen the emissaries returned from Constantinople, and described the Orthodox worship at the great cathedral of Hagia Sophia, they are reported to have said, \"We no longer knew whether we were in heaven or on earth,\" and of the beauty of the church, \"we know not how to tell of it.\"\nWe know longer knew whether we were in heaven or on earth. The visitor to an Orthodox church, on stepping inside, should ideally feel transported into a new world, one that affirms in the most forceful way that the beauty of God's creation is a manifestation of His glory and His love for mankind. The iconography that traditionally adorns the interior of an Orthodox church plays a major role in this affirmation.\nIcons have also traditionally played an educative role in the Orthodox church, conveying pictorially the lessons conveyed verbally in the Gospels—art that is \"a vehicle of the Gospel teaching,\" in the words of Leonid Ouspensky (\"The Meaning and Language of Icons\").\nAnd perhaps most importantly, on a theological level, Orthodox icons—especially icons of Christ—are statements affirming the Incarnation: \"The undepictable Word of the Father became depictable when He took flesh of you, O Theotokos\" (Kontakion for the Sunday of Orthodoxy).\nIt is with these traditions in mind that we have embarked on a major project to begin our iconography at St. Demetrios. The first phase of iconography will include the bust icon of the Platytera and infant Christ and two Angels, on the north side will be the tradition feast of the Nativity of Jesus Christ, and on the south side will be the Resurrection of Jesus Christ. Above the Platytera will be the Madylion (The Holy Napkin) depicting the face of Jesus Christ). Below the Platytera, will be the six Hierarchs, all of whom were present at the First Ecumenical Council in Nicea. We will also include 8 new full-body saints on the iconostasis all according to Holy Tradition.\nWith the blessing of His Eminence Metropolitan Isaiah, our iconographer is Leonidas Diamontopoulos. He has been working on the icons in his studio in Greece, and will come to Fort Worth to oversee their installation this month. These icons included show some of the icons \"in progress\" at Mr. Diamontopoulos's studio.\nThis first phase of the project—the installation of icons in the altar area and the iconostasis is scheduled to be begin late this month to be complete in October. The scaffolding is already up and our very own Gus Galanis is preparing the walls for the installation.\nWe are receiving some concept prints for phase two and three of our project. These next phases will plan for iconography in the nave of the church to include icons of the Life of Jesus Christ, the Feast of Mary the Theotokos and full body icons of Saints. We will discuss in more detail with Mr. Diamontopoulos when he is here. I will share this information as it becomes available.\nHow can you participate?\nWe are deeply grateful for the donations we have received to make this project possible. If you would like to participate, there are still opportunities to give. We would like to have all our parish family participate in this effort in some way, together returning to our Church the blessings and gifts we have received from the Lord. Please consider:\nGiving individually - You may choose to donate a Feast of Christ (ie Baptism of Christ, Jan 6) or a full-body saint, as an individual or as a family.\nGiving as a group - You may choose to donate a Feast of Christ or a full-body Saint icon as a group or an organization, a group of people, a family group, etc.\nMaking a general donation - If you are unable to make a donation for one specific Icon, you are encouraged to make any size donation to the General Icon Fund. This will help cover additional expenses attached to the preparations and installation of the icons.\nIf you would like to learn more about the iconography project and to give to the Iconography Fund, please speak with me or e-mail me email@example.com.\nIt is with great joy that we present to you our renditions for the beautification of our beloved church.\nPhase one will begin this fall, with the installation of new Byzantine Style Icons for the Iconostasis, to include Gold Leaf icons of Jesus Christ, the Theotokos, St. John the Baptist, St. Demetrios the Great Martyr, St. George the Great Martyr, St. Barbara the Great Martyr, and The Holy Archangles, Gabriel and Michael. Additional, the Beautiful Gate will display the Icon of the Annunciation of the Theotokos.\nBehind the Iconostasis, the beautiful icon known by its Greek name of “Platytera Ton Ouranon”; Translated from the Greek: \"[She who is] \"More Spacious than the Heavens\", or simply, Πλατυτέρα will be installed. It is the icon found in most Orthodox churches in the very prominent position - high in the front apse over the Altar table just above the mercy seat of old, and is often of such scale that it overwhelms and overshadows all other icons in the Church. Our liturgical texts proclaim the following: \"He whom not even the universe could contain was contained within the womb of a virgin, making her more spacious than the Heavens,” and “Who for us men, and our salvation, came down from heaven, was incarnate by the Holy Spirit and the Virgin Mary and became man.” Mary, the Theotokos and Mother of our God, becomes the unique person through whom God takes flesh and becomes Man thereby permitting mankind the promise of divinity and eternal life. The metaphors that are used throughout the Holy Bible to refer to her central role in God's Divine Economy are many:\nThe Theotokos is often called an Ark, for the Glory of God settled on her, just as the Glory of God descended on the Mercy Seat of the Old Testament Ark of the Covenant (Ex. 25:10-22).\nJust as Aaron's Rod sprouted miraculously in the Old Testament, so too, the Theotokos has budded forth the Flower of Immortality, Christ our God (Num. 17:1-11).\nOn Mt. Sinai, Moses saw the Bush that was burning, but was not consumed. So too, the Theotokos bore the fire of Divinity, but was not consumed (Ex. 3:1-6).\nThe Holy Great Martyr Demetrios\nSt. John the Babtist and Forerunner\nThe Holy Great Martyr Barbara\nThe Holy Great Martyr George the Trophy Bearer\nThe Holy Archangle Michael\nHoly archangle Gabriel\nThe Platytera and Hierarchs Πλατυτέρα των Ουρανών “More Spacious than the Heavens”\nDescription: The Platytera with Christ Child flanked by two reverant angels\nAngels at the mercy seat of Christ, glorifying Him. Seraphim: Prophet Elias had reported that the Seraphim above Christ, sing praises to God and unite the Divine Liturgy on earth with the Divine Liturgy of Heaven. Infant Christ, depicts Him as a naked baby on the Holy Altar and symbolizes the transubstantiation of the consecrated bread into Body and of the wine into Blood. It's the moment of the partition of the Consecrated Bread.\nSix Hierarchs of the 1st Ecumenical Council\nSt. Nicholas the Wonderworker, St. Athanasias, St. Basil the Great, St. John Chrysostom, St. Gregory the Theologian and St. Spyridon\nSt. Maximos the Confessor:\nThe Church is the image of the immaterial and of the sensory worlds– of the spiritual and the physical man. The Sanctuary is the symbol of the first, the nave– the symbol of the second. At the same time both these parts constitute an indivisible whole, in which the first enlightens and feeds the second, so that the latter becomes a sensory expression of the former. This correlation re-establishes the order of the universe violated by the transgression (of man). The Church is the earthly heaven where God, Who is above heaven dwells and abides, and it is more glorious than the tabernacle of witness. It is foreshadowed in the patriarchs, is based on the Apostles… it is foretold by the prophets, adorned by the hierarch, sanctified by the martyrs, and its high Altar stands firmly founded on their remains.\nSt. Symeon of Thesalonika :\nIt represents what is on earth, what is in heaven and what is above the heavens. The narthex corresponds to earth, the church to heaven and the Holy Sanctuary to what is above heaven. All the icons are arranged in accordance with this symbolism. It is a definite system corresponding to the part of the building where a particular image is placed.\nThe iconostasis has a symbolic meaning as well. The Holy Fathers liken it to the boundary between two worlds: the divine and human, the permanent and the transitory. The Columns represent the firmament, the, dividing the spiritual from the sensory. The horizontal beam, denotes the union through love between the heavenly and earthly. The Iconostasis, also unites the two worlds, the divine and human.","The Icon of the Eastern Orthodox Church – Research Paper\nObjectively speaking, an icon is a two-dimensional work of art found in the Eastern Orthodox religion, often portraying religious figures such as Jesus Christ, the Virgin Mary, and various saints. Obviously, icons (sometimes spelled ikons) are revered in this tradition, but their precise significance is often hard to understand.\nThe very concept of religious images is, in fact, a broad area of concern, one that did not begin even with Christianity (Gerhard 8).\nHowever, the case within this specific tradition is a very unique one. In Eastern Orthodoxy, icons are religious works of art, which, although possessing a long history and complexity of manufacture, are centrally concerned with portraying a symbolic message and serving as a tool of worship rather than exhibiting any aesthetic value.\nThe origin of religious concern for representative images does not lie with the Eastern Orthodox faith, nor did it begin with Christianity at all. The Mosaic law of Judaism contained a tenet which read, “Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth” (Exodus 20:4). Although the English translation appears quite clear, in ancient Judaism, this commandment was a constant subject of argumentation, as many interpreted the word “image” as closer to “idol” than any literal image (9).\nThe developing Christian world, however, was nurtured in a land influenced by more than Jewish tradition. The Greek attitude toward images and even image worship was quite favorable. Paintings and statues of their mythical gods and heroes covered classical Greece, while even Rome adopted the Greek imagery into the culture of its own people (12). In addition, the Syrian civilization introduced to the Mediterranean world its own artistic style of frontal poses and large facial features (Cavarnos 14). Israel, the birthplace and location of the ministry of Jesus, was the cradle of Christianity and was centrally Jewish, which usually rejected images unconditionally. However, Christianity was quickly becoming an expanding church, and its increasing acceptance forced Christians throughout the Old World to evaluate their stand on representative images (Gerhard 14).\nAmong the Orthodox tradition, there exists a legend of the first icon, which began with Christ. John Stuart explains:\nTradition has it that Abgar, King of Edessa, who was afflicted with leprosy, heard tell that Christ could restore him to health. He accordingly sent one Ananias as an ambassador to Palestine with instructions to find Our Lord and return with him to Edessa. When Ananias finally caught up with him, Christ was addressing a great throng of people. Being unable to approach nearer, Ananias began to sketch the face of Christ, although needless to say, with very little success. But Christ was aware of what Ananias was doing. When he had dismissed the crowds, he took a piece of linen; soaking it in water, he pressed it firmly to his face and then handed it to Ananias. When the latter had taken the towel into his hands, he saw that Christ’s features were clearly imprinted upon it.\nChrist declined to go to Edessa but promised to send a disciple after his death. And Edessa was to become, in fact, the first Christian state. Meanwhile, Ananias was instructed to take the towel to King Abgar, as a substitute for Christ’s presence. (31)\nEventually, with the increasing influx of complete Mediterranean culture in the Christian world, images gained greater acceptance. In the Byzantine area (the region around Constantinople named for the old name of the city, Byzantium), the Christian imagery was mostly affected by the Hellenistic (Greek and Roman) and Syrian culture (Cavarnos 14).\nThe central Hellenistic influence in Christian iconography was the art of mosaics. Early Christians used this technique to decorate the walls, floors, domes, etc of their churches. Syrian art effectively gave rise to the use of frescoes in Christian churches. The third type of icon—the panel icon—is the most widely used in Russia and most other regions of the Orthodox faith. It consists of a picture painted on a chalk-covered wooden panel treated with an egg solution, or tempera (17).\nThe actual process of creating a panel icon is very complex. First, the icon-maker must go search for the correct type of wood. Cypress was used in Greece; birch and oak were often sought after in Russia, as well as was a good, sturdy pine from Siberia (Gerhard 208). After carving the panel into the correct size and shape with an axe or two-handed plane, it is stored away to remove its moisture. This process normally takes five or six years. After this period, gesso, or chalk, is ground onto its surface to prepare the panel for the next step. This step involves the draughtsman, who sketches the basic outline of the picture in charcoal. When this is completed, he removes the charcoal and paints the outline in a black-colored paint. After the fundamental outline of the image is complete, the surface is gilded with an egg-paste mixture to prepare it for the actual pigmented paint (Stuart 42).\nOn the icon, the first sections painted are the background (such as buildings and nature) and the clothing of the subjects involved. Normally, gold ornamentation follows, which involves painting on sticky resin followed by the application of light gold sheets, after which the sheets are polished. Next, the icon-painter begins painting the subjects’ faces. These comprise the most precise skill on the part of the painter, who must endow the faces with the very spirit and life force of the subject in the picture. A layer of varnish, normally comprised of linseed or olive oil is applied. Finally, it is transported to a church for a blessing (Gerhard 210). The icon is then complete.\nThe Byzantine art style is fundamentally different from the classic western style of realistic sketches and Renaissance-type paintings. The icon painter, as a member of this Byzantine tradition, approaches art with symbols in mind, rather than a realistic concept of some natural object (Stuart 25). Much like a Chinese calligrapher wanting to depict a tree in a work of writing composes a specific character meaning “tree,” rather than drawing any actual tree that he may see or conceptualize, the icon painter creates specific symbolic paintings that illustrate the various religious ideas wishing to be expressed.\nTruly, iconography is more concerned with symbolism than physical appearances. The object of an icon is to capture the spirit and meaning of what the image is trying to portray. Constantine Cavarnos maintains that “True iconography is intended to take us beyond anatomy and the three-dimensional world of matter to a realm that is immaterial, spaceless, timeless—the realm of the spirit, of eternity. And hence the forms and colors are not those that one customarily observes around him, but have something unworldly about them” (38). Indeed, these metaphors elicit associations and can give an extended message than what is possible in a work concerned with physical beauty and perspective exactness.\nIt is of importance to note that the colors used in an icon are metaphorical rather than actual; icon colors often do not follow the color patterns in nature. Rather than making sure all the colors are in harmony with natural appearance, the icon painter will seek a harmony with the spiritual message in his art. Colors are very important for this harmony; each color symbolizes an aspect of the icon and gives a special meaning. For instance, deep red and royal purple are symbolic of the blood of Christ and are often used for the shoes of royal figures. Blue represents heaven and the ethereal. The greens and browns are usually used in familiar manners, representing the earth and vegetation—a reminder of our existence on this earth. From scarlet red comes vigor and vitality, a color used for the blood of martyrs and the cloak of St. George. Orange-red symbolizes the purification of the spirit. White suggests purity and colors the garments of Christ and his angels (28).\nTo give a specific example of the abstract nature of icon art, the faces of the characters depicted always are turned facing the viewer—the person giving their respects and their prayers. This rule holds true regardless of the character’s perspective position in their environment (Upensky 60). In fact, not only are the heads facing the viewer, the important figures in the image have their entire body turned outward in this manner. The rest, the less important, are normally subject to the laws of three-dimensional perspectives. Additionally, where those significant figures are generally depicted as stationary, the rest are again interacting with their environment and are often moving (65).\nSuperceding the hassle over the concern of the icon complying with the “hows” of natural laws and perspectives is the concern of why the natural laws work. This question of “why?” has always been a consideration for Byzantine religious artists. They do not comply with the classic paintings—those that depict photographically accurate settings; again, icons portray the religious nature and symbolism of their scenes (Stuart 36). A naturalistic painting may show Saint Peter as tall and powerful, completely in perspective with his environment, but an icon will depict him in an unrealistic-looking but completely symbolic and explanatory setting.\nIcons may be placed in any location, such as a home or shop, but the central location where they are situated is, of course, the church. When one enters an Orthodox church, immediately noticeable is the iconostasis—a giant screen, composed of wood or marble, that supports the panel icons. On top of the iconostasis is a large cross with the figure of the crucified Christ. In Eastern Orthodoxy, there is great significance given to the Virgin Mary and John the Baptist, whose icons are placed on the iconostasis to the right and left of Christ (Cavarnos 23). In most church buildings, icons cover most of the interior. As mentioned before, each icon portrays a religious message. When all the icons are displayed, the composite of the images inside the church gives the building an entirely new symbolism. The church is, in effect, a microcosm for the universe, where the iconographic messages reveal the universal plan of eternal salvation (Stuart 38).\nDuring church services, the icons are ritually given respect. The deacon of the church wields a censer and directs it toward the icons. This indicates to the congregation that they are to contemplate the icons and understand that the saints painted on the icons are participating in the service in a similar manner as the worshippers themselves (33).\nIcons in the Eastern Orthodox tradition serve several primary purposes. Most apparent to outsiders is their aesthetic value. They embellish and amplify the beauty of a church. Secondly, they instruct their faithful members in matters of doctrine, many times employing symbols that effectively surpass written doctrine (Cavarnos 30). Icons also remind these members of their faith. Their powerful message serves to remind and awaken the faith of the members of the church. In almost every instance, a saint or holy figure is portrayed on the icon. This serves to set an example for the members of the Eastern Orthodox faith. The righteous individual on the icon gives them a model with which to pattern their lives. This person on the image causes the member to be stirred up in faith and righteous zeal (32).\nSurpassing all other purposes, the icon is a conduit for prayer and worship (Stuart 29). Each member of the congregation is allowed to light a candle, come to an icon, and make the sign of the cross. They then will reverence the icon with a kiss and say a prayer (Ugolnik 45). The Eastern Orthodox Church makes it very clear, however, that its members are not worshipping the icon, but giving it “honorable reverence.” Worship is due only to God, and the icon is a medium through which that worship may be expressed (Cavarnos 33).\nThis worship is the ultimate fulfillment of Byzantine iconography. Even with its extensive history and stunning methods of artistry, the sacredness of the icon surpasses all aesthetic and external value. The symbolism of the holy icon is truly the center of Eastern Orthodox worship. It allows its members to transcend their visible physical reality and enter into the ultimate reality, where spiritual truth is juxtaposed with material truth (Stuart 39). It allows one to comprehend the mutual dependence of matter and spirit and truly gives a perspective of far greater significance than the visible temporal universe that one is commonly allowed.\nCavarnos, Constantine.

{"question":"I'm researching fiber durability in different climates. What are the maintenance characteristics and environmental responses of both wool and acrylic yarns when exposed to various conditions?","answer":"Wool and acrylic yarns respond very differently to environmental conditions. Wool, particularly varieties like Southdown, can withstand warm and damp conditions but may felt over time, which can affect its elasticity. When exposed to rough conditions or abrasion, some wools may develop holes. In contrast, acrylic yarn is more resilient to certain environmental factors - it won't be damaged by moths or mildew, and it won't felt or shrink when machine washed. However, acrylic has specific limitations: it doesn't breathe like natural fibers and can feel clammy in warm climates. Additionally, unlike wool which burns, acrylic melts when exposed to heat, requiring caution when used in certain applications.","context":["Lots of people enter the world of spinning with the aim of spinning for socks...\nThen they fall down the rabbit hole and discover just how many things go in to making a good sock yarn. Before you even get in to fibre choice, there's the issue of number of plies (more is better), wether to go classic 3-ply, or modern chain ply (tests seem to show there's very little difference), or even to use opposing plies.\nA good sock yarn needs to have bounce and memory. Otherwise the ribbing at the top bags out, and your socks fall down. It needs to withstand lots of friction, and needs to be able to put up with getting warm and damp. Those are of course conditions for felting. Some people are ok with their socks felting, which is fine providing that doesn't make them shrink. It also removes some of that elasticity. So I prefer a fibre that resists felting.\nIf you want to go pure wool, then Southdown is a really good bet. It resists felting, and has great elasticity. However, it's not great at resisting abrasion. If you have rough feet, or rough patches in your footwear you will get holes.\nAs well as Southdown I always used to offer a Superwash BFL & Nylon blend. This was great, because the superwash treatment resists felting, and it was hardwearing from the nylon. However, it was actually very similar to the Superwash BFL & Ramie base that I adore. So last summer I started experimenting. I still wanted a really machine-washable option (you can put Southdown in the machine, but I wanted a superwash treated fibre, that people could also use for garments). It also needed to be resist to abrasion, and have more bounce than the Superwash BFL.\nAnd the final result... Two swatches. One went through a machine wash pinned to my jeans pocket. The other was unwashed. The stitches still move, and the size remained un-changed. It's a delight to dye as well.\nI'm still using British wool, which was important to me. But it's slightly more coarse than BFL (but for your feet that's really not an issue), and is lovely and bouncy. You could still use this fibre for jumpers, cardigans, gloves and hats, it's definitely not Herdwick!\nThe Cheviot Hills are in the border area between Scotland and England, and remind me so much of my own bit of Wales.\nBy Cheviot_ewe_with_lamb.jpg: Donald Macleod from Stornoway, Scotlandderivative work: Coycan (Cheviot_ewe_with_lamb.jpg) [CC BY 2.0 (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/2.0)], via Wikimedia Commons\nThe sheep that live in the area are hardy, living on the hills all year round. They have a lovely bulky fleece, with a 3D crimp that makes the fibre bouncey, and hard wearing. The staple length is 4-5 inches, which makes it excellent for worsted spinning, just what you want from a sock yarn.\nTo add to the strength I've kept the nylon component. It really does help stop holes developing. To help with the dyeing, because Cheviot is a chalky fibre that can be a bit of a pain to hand dye, and to allow me to dye the eye-socking colours some love in their socks I've added some tussah silk.\nI did a small batch for the online shop a few weeks ago, and also had some for sale at Wonderwool.

It is readily available and comes in an array of weights, colors and textures. Acrylic yarn is easy to work with and moderately priced compared with other yarns.\nAcrylic fiber has been in production in the United States since 1950 when DuPont introduced Orlon. Acrylic is a synthetic fiber that has a a chemical base of 85 to 90 percent vinyl cyanide. The remaining percentage determines the unique characteristics of the particular brand of fiber. Now, acrylic fiber is produced all over the world, and is used in clothing manufacturing as well as for craft yarn.\nAcrylic yarn wears better than wool and has good elasticity. However, acrylic is not as strong as other synthetics such as nylon and polyester. Garments knitted from acrylic yarn is light and soft, and wicks away moisture. In addition, they will not be eaten by moths or suffer from mildew damage.\nAlthough acrylic yarn looks like wool, the fiber will not felt or shrink when machine washed. The easy-care nature of acrylic yarn makes it a good choice for items thatl need frequent washing, such as children's sweaters and hats. It is also lighter than fibers such as cotton, so an afghan knitted with acrylic yarn will be warm without being heavy.\nLike all synthetic fibers, acrylic does not burn, it melts. Caution is needed when choosing acrylic yarn for kitchen items and for baby clothes. Acrylic does not breath like natural fibers, so in warm climates it may feel clammy to wear acrylic garments.\nYarn manufacturers often blend acrylic fiber with natural fibers. When added to cotton or other plant-based fiber, the resulting yarn is lighter and stronger. Acrylic blended with protein fibers like wool creates a yarn that is machine washable. Sock knitters appreciate the strength that acrylic adds to sock yarn. Many novelty yarns, such as ribbon or boucle are blends of several synthetic fibers.\n- Photo Credit yarn 3 image by Jeffrey Sinnock from Fotolia.com\nWhat Is a Staple Yarn?\nStaple, or spun, yarn is produced from short-length fibers called staple.

{"question":"What is the relationship between gamma rays and Einstein's E=MC^2 equation in both nuclear power generation and space phenomena?","answer":"Einstein's E=MC^2 equation demonstrates how a small amount of mass can be converted into enormous amounts of energy in both nuclear power generation and cosmic events. In nuclear power, this principle explains why just a pound of uranium contains as much energy as about 3 million tons of coal. In space, extraordinarily high-energy gamma rays, such as those generated by black holes, can actually create matter - specifically pairs of electrons and their antimatter counterparts (positrons). This matter creation demonstrates the conversion between energy and mass described by Einstein's equation. Gamma ray bursts in space are the most powerful explosions known, capable of releasing as much energy as our sun would emit during its entire 10 billion year lifetime in just milliseconds to minutes.","context":["I watched Diehard last weekend and it was entertaining; huzzah explosions and all that. I only had one issue with the movie and that was the complete misunderstanding of nuclear energy. My instinctual anger at horrible physics was related to one scene in the movie, it wasn't even 30 seconds long, yet there was still soo much misinformation.\nThe plot of the die hard movie revolved the idea that Chernobyl was a man made accident (it was) which was brought about by illegal weapons merchants getting greedy selling reactor byproducts or fuels (it wasn't). There was a warehouse containing weapons grade uranium 235 which, would simply not happen as a reactor byproduct or a fuel, and even this didn't set off my bad science alert. I'm more than willing to accept some fudging of accuracy for the merits of storytelling. I got pissed off when they entered the warehouse containing said uranium and determined the radiation had been pooling for decades, and they had a spray to neutralize it. Those two statements actually angered me.\nNuclear fuels and waste products are relatively safe. You don't want to put them in your pillow and sleep on them every night but handling them is not some sort of life threatening risk. Diehard even accurately depicted this, however they had to clean up \"pooled\" radiation. Radiation isn't a gas or a liquid. It simply can't, ever or under any circumstances pool. Radio-nuclides don't become more dangerous over time. Radiation radiates, until it hits something and is absorbed.\n|Yep not really great against radiation|\nIt's pretty simple, and yet someone felt they needed to address this issue write a script, develop a technology and CGI the cleaning of the radiation for something that simply wasn't even a major plot point. They even said the fuel is stable and there are no major short term exposure risks. They took off their protective suits. Maybe I'm perseverating, but to me, Hollywood acts like it's some sort of intellectual mecca, yet no one on a big budget movie said hey this is dumb. The fact that they filmed the clip, which again wasn't a critical plot point at all, and then dumped it on the public is more indicative of a fundamental misunderstanding of nuclear physics in the general populace.\nAlpha Radiation: Alpha radiation is the same thing as a helium nucleus its large and that's why it can be stopped by paper. Not really a threat to anyone.\nNeutron Radiation: Neutron radiation is essentially only produced during a nuclear reaction, its barrier requirements are very high and it essentially disappears when a reactor is shut down.\nBeta Radiation: Beta radiation comes in two forms beta + and beta-. This is simply an electron or the oppositely charged component called a positron. It is readily stopped by stuff that's thicker than a piece of paper and beta emitting material is usually trapped in the pipes circulating around a reactor.\nGamma radiation: Gamma radiation is essentially light, its light that we can't see but its just light. It's emitted from particles and in the reactor. overwhelmingly gamma radiation is what people are referring to as radiation in a nuclear plant.\nFrom this synopsis you should be able to get that the only two types of radiation we worry about is beta and gamma, the others only exist when the reactor is running or are essentially nonthreatening. Beta emitters are produced as some of the fuel degrades or byproducts escape into the water. In a nuclear plant beta radiation is safely contained in pipes. The only time it becomes a threat is when work has to be completed, assuming proper procedures are followed (they are or you get fired) the exposure and risk is minimal. The only radiation truly worth tracking is gamma exposure.\nBoth beta and gamma radiation are produced from radio-nuclides breaking down into more stable component's. nuclides that break down are called radioactive. If you just said aha that's why radiation levels couldn't have been worse after fifty years you get a gold star. As more of a nuclide breaks down there is less remaining, so radiation levels drop. The way we measure the activity of decomposing material is through half lives. A half life simply put is the period of time required for you to have half of the starting radioactive material.\n|Uranium is all natural so it must be safe :-P|\nSo how dangerous is the material, well that depends on the half life and the amount of time elapsed. Because Uranium 235 has a half life of about 703 million years its not all that dangerous. The statement \"A candle that burns twice as bright burns half as long\" is a solid analogy. Radio-nuclides that have really short half lives are dangerous but not for a very long time. There are some radioactive materials which decay into more radioactive materials before becoming stable but these are uncommon.\nSo what makes an element radioactive? Well in short it's the number of neutrons an element has (protons and electrons define what the element is). The total number of protons and neutrons determines the atomic mass of an element. The different atomic masses are what we call isotopes which is is the difference when talking about Uranium 235 vs. say the more common Uranium 238. The difference between these two isotopes is 3 neutrons and that difference makes uranium 235 more prone to undergo fission in a nuclear reaction. We can say that Uranium 235 is more fissile than Uranium 238.\n|Nuclear Energy: think of the amount of nuclear energy derived being equal to the difference between your staring element and final element|\nSo how do we get Uranium 235, well hydrogen and other elements undergo fusion in stars but that essentially only forms iron. When stars supernova the released energy forces fusion to higher elements. Then as time goes on the unstable elements decay leaving the more stable ones behind. Uranium 235 may have the impressive half life of 703.8 million years but Uranium 238 has a half life of almost 4.5 billion. This leaves us with a relative abundance of about .72% Uranium 235.\nWe like Uranium 235 though, its easier to use so we have to .... enrich the uranium sample. How do you do that? Primarily through diffusion. In short because Uranium 235 is less massive than Uranium 238 it moves faster. So if you turn the uranium into a gas or a liquid through chemical processes then attach this to a really really long tube or series of tubes the Uranium 235 and Uranium 238 will flow at different rates. Considering were talking about a 3 neutron difference this process is needless to say fairly expensive.\n|Lot's of tubes and a really long time|\nHow do we know the limitations and that rectors wont go boom? Well that has to do with the measurable concept of criticality. Criticality is a fancy way of saying whether a nuclear reaction is slowing, speeding up or maintaining speed. The definition of criticality is essentially dividing the current generation of free neutrons by the previous generation. if the value is 1 the reactor is running critical, if the value is greater than 1 the reactor is running super-critical and if the value is less than one it is running sub-critical. Yes reactors run critical or super-critical all the time and no one dies (unlike the movies). When the control rods are withdrawn from the fuel cells the reactor will run super-critical until it becomes critical.\nSo when we are looking to blow crap up we know that we need the number or unrestricted neutrons to essentially remain critical while the rest of the material explodes. the less refined the material the more of it is needed to maintain this unrestricted fission.The mass of material needed to maintain the number of neutrons generated is known as the... critical mass. At a 6% concentration of Uranium 235 the mass required to sustain a nuclear blast is infinite. This doesn't just mean that reactors won't go boom, it means they physically can not.\nIt also means the Diehard explanation for Chernobyl is a bit flaky, if the bad guy was buying weapons grade uranium to run as fuel then the operators would have simply adjusted the reactor to run critical, no boom. If he was trying to run the reactor to produce Uranium 235... well he cant. The original concerns were for reactors producing plutonium which would still require enrichment to be weapons usable. This would have again collapsed the entire story. Like I said it was a story telling device so I tried to merely grimace. It would also mean that in order for the plot to have happened socialist governments have to be the most corrupt bribe taking ...oh wait never mind.\nSo what did happen at Chernobyl, or Fukushima? and what is a meltdown? Nuclear plants and reactors are inherently safe. In fact you either have to try to cause them to fail or there needs to be an act of god. This actually explains both Chernobyl and Fukushima but only vaguely. The only weakness to a nuclear reactor is its coolant supply. See nuclear reactions release a lot of energy, literally shit loads of it. Even with the control rods in there is still some latent heat and reactions occurring. As such cooling water must always be supplied to the reactor even during shut down. Even the spent fuel has a cooling system. A lack of cooling over a prolonged period of time will start to raise temperatures significantly. If things get too hot parts fail.\nSee Chernobyl was a byproduct of Russian engineering which is an oxymoron like military intelligence. It was also a generation 1 reactor built as a publicity stunt by the soviet empire. In short it was almost doomed to fail. Chernobyl had no form of containment, there was no cement dome or pressure seals or really any safeguards in case of equipment failure. But even that oversight wasn't as dumb as the reactor operators deciding to run a drill around coolant failure procedures... by actually shutting down the coolant. Im guessing USSR school fire drills must have consisted of lighting the school on fire.\nBy the time they decided to restore cooling the plant had failed, the components had gotten hot enough to start producing flammable gasses. This exploded breaching their lack of containment with a variety of radioactive salts and byproducts. So that's kind of a bad problem, whats worse is it happened behind the iron curtain and information and aid was refused by the soviets. All in all the total death count was.. 31 people. That's it the largest nuclear disaster in the history of mankind killed 31 people. There are other estimates which are higher but 31 is the only actual number of solidly recorded deaths.\nThe next big nuclear disaster is Fukushima, which resulted after a massive earthquake and tsunami basically destroyed all power and utilities transmission to the plant. As a result of not being able to maintain pumping capabilities the reactor overheated and ... oh ya there was containment. Only one of the reactors breached containment. and the release was not all that bad. 0 people died in the incident. Most incident reports and even a lawsuit are alleging that the government and a lack of a questioning attitude are to blame for Fukushima. Fukushima was another publicity nuclear powerplant, attempting to show the world the glory of Japan.\nSo what does that mean for us? Well we learned a lot from these two disasters. modern plants are being designed with automatic redundancies and gravity based cooling systems. Because of current design modification plants are able to be produced almost 80% cheaper than in previous years even with extra redundancy systems. The Westinghouse AP1000 is so well designed that we are actually seeing nuclear plants constructed again after a halt in production for almost 30 years in the US. Like I said nuclear plants are insanely safe and they generate crap load of power. Nuclear power is the safest source in terms of deaths per trillion kilowatt hours with 90, wind comes in second with 150. Its also got the smallest carbon footprint for those who care.\nI have explained how radiation works, and how it's not dangerous. I also explained how nuclear plants are inherently safe and how some of the terminology should be applied to them. What I haven't covered is where the energy comes from. That's important because its the easiest way to explain why nuclear power will always beat out wind and solar. We started walking down the nuclear road after Einstein's famous equation E=MC^2. For those who don't read math it states that the energy that can be produced from a given mass is the same as that mass multiplied by the square of the speed of light. The speed of light is a big number so squaring that means that only a little bit of mass is needed to make that change. you can find estimates around to try to get an idea of how much energy is in uranium but a pound of uranium contains as much energy as about 3 million tons of coal.\nI'd rather not show the math for a fission reaction because fusion is simply easier and demonstrates the same principle. First lets look at a hydrogen from a periodic table.\nWere going to use 2 kilogram moles of deuterium to produce 1 kilogram mole of Helium. a kilogram weighs about 2.5 pounds so this is about 5 pounds of stuff. A mole basically is the atomic mass of something in the units I want to measure. It ensure a relatively consistent number of atoms for the reaction so I'm starting with 4.028 kg of deuterium and through fusion producing 4.002602 kg of Helium. so the math is 4.028 kg-4.002602 kg=.025398 kilograms of mass lost. not a whole hell of a lot of mass lost but all of it and I mean every bit of it is converted to energy. So pulling out Einsteins formula .025398*8.98755179*10^16 m^2/s^2, or 2.28*10^15 watts.\nThat's a shitload of energy but really doesn't mean jack to me. That's a number bigger than my comprehension so how long would that amount of energy power a 100 watt light bulb. so we take our value divide it by 100W*24 hours/day* 365days/yr.\n(.025398*c^2)/(100*24*365)=2.6*10^9 years so our 5 pounds of stuff is capable of powering a lightbulb for 2.6 billion years. Granted the max efficiency is gonna be somewhere around say 40% so that 5 pounds of stuff will realistically only power that light bulb for around a billion years. Lets leave it at a shitload of energy.\nOf course that's fusion but fission reactor potential energy isn't that much different even if it was off by a factor of 100 its still crap loads of energy. That energy abundance is why we don't realistically have to worry about running out of energy and why we have plenty of time to figure out fusion. Uranium isnt the only fissile element, while its currently used in modern reactors there are other technologies available.\nCurrently research is resuming on molten salt and thorium reactors as the generation 4 technology. These reactor types were abandoned due to political pressure but they are actually safer and more abundant than current uranium reactors (fun fact uranium is more abundant than silver). Assuming a switch to these technologies it would mean that meltdowns would be even less likely to occur if not impossible.\nFun fact modern nuclear power costs are around 6-7cents per kilowatt hour coal and natural gas is about 3-5cents and wind and solar run around 12-20cents per kilowatt hour depending on the technology. with gen IV reactors looking to be cost comparable to coal i think we can kiss wind and solar goodbye..... without political intervention.","Gamma rays are blamed for making Bruce Banner the Incredible Hulk. But what are gamma rays and what can they really do?\nGamma rays are the highest energy form of light. The rainbow of visible light that we are most familiar with is just part of a far broader spectrum of light, the electromagnetic spectrum. Past the red end of the rainbow, where wavelengths get longer, are infrared rays, microwaves and radio waves, while beyond violet lie the shorter wavelengths of ultraviolet rays, X-rays and, finally, gamma rays.\nA gamma ray packs at least 10,000 times more energy than a visible light ray. Unlike the Incredible Hulk, gamma rays are not green — lying as they do beyond the visible spectrum, gamma rays have no color at all that we can describe.\nExactly how Bruce Banner survives his transformation is unclear.\nJust as high doses of X-rays are typically lethal, so too would an explosion of gamma rays kill the average person.\nGamma rays can knock electrons around like a bowling ball would bowling pins. These charged particles can then disrupt any chemical bond they come across, wreaking havoc on the delicate chemical machinery of the cell and generating molecular fragments that can act as toxins.\nTo put it gently, a gamma bomb in the real world would not turn Bruce Banner into the Incredible Hulk. Rather, it would likely quickly turn him into a corpse dead from radiation sickness, if not incinerating him instantly.\nStill, gamma rays can have medical applications — a medical device known as the gamma knife can kill tumors by aiming gamma rays at a patient's brain.\nWhen Bruce Banner becomes the Incredible Hulk, his body swells with muscles seemingly from out of nowhere. Intriguingly, gamma rays can be so powerful that they can actually create matter. This is because, as Einstein's formula E = mc2 explains, energy can get converted to matter, and vice versa. Extraordinarily high-energy gamma rays, such as ones that black holes can generate, can yield pairs of electrons and their antimatter counterparts, known as positrons. (Whether the Incredible Hulk uses gamma rays to violate the law of conservation of matter and grow is another question.)\nGamma rays in space\nGamma rays are created under some of the most violent events in the universe, such as the death of stars. The Gamma-Ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST), set to launch June 11, will be the first gamma-ray observatory to survey the entire sky every day with unprecedented sensitivity, and the hope is that it will open a dramatic new window onto the cosmos. (GLAST will receive a new name once in orbit, chosen from some 12,000 suggestions given by the general public around the world, and the name \"Hulk\" did come up.)\nIn particular, GLAST could shed light on mysterious gamma ray bursts, which can unleash as much energy as our sun during its entire 10 billion year lifetime in anywhere from milliseconds to a minute or more. Just as the Incredible Hulk \"is the strongest one there is,\" as he says himself, so too are gamma ray bursts the most powerful explosions known.\nIndeed, just as the Incredible Hulk is strong enough to destroy the entire planet, so too can a gamma ray burst kill life on this world. A \"death star\" was recently discovered that might one day explode with a gamma ray burst directed straight at us — although it might readily miss."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:08aa7f47-2074-41d1-9b43-0e6001f3e6a6>","<urn:uuid:9cfe7e76-c3ea-4e6d-9488-bd1a8d9ee6c2>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which came first: Bearden's Profile series exhibitions or the Modern Art stamps featuring American artists?","answer":"Bearden's Profile series exhibitions came first. The Profile series was exhibited at the Cordier & Ekstrom Gallery in New York with Part I shown in 1979 and Part II in 1981. The Modern Art in America stamps, which featured various American artists' works from 1912-1931, were issued much later in 2013 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Armory Show.","context":["“Something Over Something Else”: Romare Bearden’s Profile Series\nClosing February 2, 2020\nIn 1978, Romare Bearden (American, 1911–1988) launched an autobiographical project organized by the decades of his life. The Profile series begins with Bearden’s earliest memories as a boy in North Carolina in the 1910s and concludes with his life as a young artist in Harlem in the early 1940s.\nThis exhibition draws its title from the 1977 New Yorker article that spurred Bearden to create the Profile series. Authored by Calvin Tomkins for the magazine’s “Profiles” section, the biographical essay, “Putting Something over Something Else,” was titled after Bearden’s own words describing the creative process. The experience of being interviewed for this article, and recounting moments stretching back to childhood, inspired Bearden to create his own word-and-picture elaborations on the decades of his life.\nBearden exhibited the Profile series at the Cordier & Ekstrom Gallery in New York—Part I in 1979 and Part II in 1981. For each collage, Bearden and his friend Albert Murray, an author and critic, co-wrote titles and short statements about people and places from Bearden’s past. When first exhibiting the works, Bearden hand-wrote these captions onto the gallery walls next to each collage, giving the “feeling of traveling through a personal diary,” as one reviewer described it.\nWe often understand our past as a series of events strung together, with beginnings, climactic moments, and conclusions. Bearden offers an alternative. With Profile, memories become singular events: a funeral, a comedy show, a neighbor gardening, a train ride at sunset. Bearden layers these separate moments, one on top of another, creating a collage, rather than a story, of his life.\n“Something Over Something Else”: Romare Bearden’s Profile Series is the first reassembling of the Profile exhibitions. A majority of works in the series are brought together in their original order and exhibited with the text as Bearden first intended.\nOnce it was mid September again, it was back to Miss Pinkney and books, black boards, rulers and fingernail inspection.\nSchool Bell Time, 1978\nKingsborough Community College —The City University of New York\nBorn in 1911, Bearden spent his early childhood in the Charlotte, North Carolina, homeplace of his paternal grandparents. After moving with his parents to Harlem, Bearden often returned South for visits. In Profile/Part I, the artist drew on memories from these years in Mecklenburg County.\nI can still smell the flowers she used to give us and still taste the blackberries.\nMaudell Sleet’s Magic Garden, 1978\nCollection of Pearson C. Cummin III and Linda Forrest Cummin\nPart I of the series begins, in Bearden’s words, at “about [age] six,” when “memory starts.” He offers impressions of daily life: the first day of school, his friend Liza, people on front porches, daily labor in the cotton fields at the edge of town. The accompanying titles and texts fill out the stories told in pictures: the taste of berries from a garden, church sermons and baptisms, musicians in the streets.\nYou could tell not only what train it was but also who the engineer was by the sound of the whistle.\nDaybreak Express, 1978\nCourtesy of the McConnell Family Trust\nThe pictures in this series are small, made deliberately so to convey the experience of an adult revisiting his childhood haunts, which Bearden did for the first time in 1976. “Although in your imagination everything looks so big to you when you’re a child,” he remarked, “when you go back you find that it’s only two or three strides, that it ain’t that big. So I felt more comfortable doing these things small.”\nThe mills went 24 hours a day with three 8-hour shifts.\nPittsburgh Memories, Mill Hand’s Lunch Bucket, 1978\nCincinnati Art Museum, museum purchase, the Edwin and Virginia Irwin Memorial and the John J. Emery Endowment\nAs a child, Bearden often made summer visits to his maternal grandmother in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. In 1927, Bearden left Harlem for Pittsburgh to attend high school, living with his grandmother in the boardinghouse she ran in the city’s East Liberty neighborhood. Like the Mecklenberg County collages, the four works that make up the Pittsburgh Memories section in Part I show domestic interiors and community gatherings.\nThe sporting people were allowed to come but they had to stand on the far right.\nPittsburgh Memories, Farewell Eugene, 1978\nIn Farewell Eugene, the final work in Part I, Bearden pays homage to his friend with a memory of his funeral. The picture shows a gathering of church people and “sporting people” (for Eugene’s mother lived in a bordello), in addition to Bearden’s grandmother, who had taken Eugene in during the final months of his life. Eugene’s pigeons, which he had asked Bearden to release, fly overhead.\nThe trains in the stories she told always ran North.\nPepper Jelly Lady, 1981\nCollection of Joy and Larry Silverstein\nBearden presented Part II of Profile in the spring of 1981. The scale of works in this series is larger, the materials more varied, and the works fewer. Part II opens with a retrospective glance at Mecklenburg County and then jumps to Manhattan, where the artist is influenced by new scenes and people in his early adulthood.\nHe was my favorite of all the comedians. What Johnny Hudgins could do through mime on an empty stage helped show me how worlds were created on an empty canvas.\nJohnny Hudgins Comes On, 1981\nSeavest Collection of Contemporary Realism, White Plains, NY\nThe music scenes of 1920s and ’30s New York depicted here are particularly noteworthy, including theaters, a rehearsal hall, and Barron’s, where jazz musicians could hold down the house piano only for as long as they held the Harlem virtuosos’ attention.\nEvery Friday Licia used to come to my studio to model for me upstairs above the Apollo Theater.\nArtist with Painting and Model, 1981\nHigh Museum of Art, Atlanta, purchased with funds from Alfred Austell Thornton in memory of Leila Austell Thornton and Albert Edward Thornton, Sr., and Sarah Miller Venable and William Hoyt Venable, Margaret and Terry Stent Endowment for the Acquisition of American Art, David C.

Sivan and Jeff Hines, Brenda and Larry Thompson, and a gift to honor Howard Elkins from the Docents of the High Museum of Art, 2014.66\nAs in Part I, in this series Bearden shares his point of view but rarely a picture of himself—with one exception. Artist with Painting & Model shows Bearden at about age thirty, standing in his Harlem studio above the Apollo Theater, surrounded by his many muses: a model, reproductions of African and European artworks, references to jazz compositions, and (with his arm draped proudly atop it) his own work from this time, featured prominently upon the easel.\n“I really think the art of painting is the art of putting something over something else.” —Romare Bearden\nBorn in in Charlotte, North Carolina in 1911, Bearden spent his early childhood living with his mother and father in the home of his paternal grandparents. After his parents relocated to Harlem, he returned for visits.\nAs a child, Bearden often visited his maternal grandmother in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, during the summers. In 1927, Bearden left Harlem for Pittsburgh to attend high school, living with his grandmother in the boardinghouse she ran in the city’s East Liberty neighborhood.\nBearden’s early adult life was spent in Harlem where he was influenced greatly by the music halls, the working girls, and famous acts at the Lafayette Theater.

The U.S. Postal Service will commemorate the occasion with the issuance of the Modern Art in America stamp sheet.\nThis gorgeous pane of self-adhesive Forever® stamps features a dozen masterpieces created between 1912 and 1931. For design purposes and to preserve the horizontal or vertical orientation of the artworks, the stamp sizes vary.\nStuart Davis’s vibrant depictions of contemporary commercial objects made him an important precursor of the later Pop artists. His oil-on-canvas painting, House and Street (1931), presents two views of a street in New York, forcing the viewer to be in two places at once.\nCharles Demuth, a leading watercolorist of his era, created memorable “poster portraits” of several of his friends, including the poet William Carlos Williams, the subject of the work I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold (1928), in oil, graphite, ink, and gold leaf on paperboard.\nAaron Douglas was the most important visual artist to emerge from the Harlem Renaissance. The gouache-on-paper painting, The Prodigal Son (1927), was created in a modernist style that has been described as “Afro-Cubism.”\nArthur Dove was one of modern art’s earliest abstract painters and was probably the first American artist to paint a totally abstract canvas. Dove was interested in attempting to duplicate sound as colors and shapes. The oil-on-canvas painting, Fog Horns (1929), suggests the peal of foghorns at sea.\nMarcel Duchamp, an important forerunner of the Pop art and conceptual art movements, outraged and disturbed many viewers by irreverently flouting artistic convention. His oil-on-canvas painting, Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2 (1912), was the most talked-about work at the Armory Show of 1913.\nMarsden Hartley was one of America’s greatest modernist painters. His oil-on-canvas work, Painting, Number 5 (1914-15), is an abstract composite portrait of Karl von Freyburg, a young German officer who was killed in World War I.\nJohn Marin was the preeminent watercolorist of his era. He transformed the medium by experimenting with abstraction, such as in his watercolor-on-paper painting, Sunset, Maine Coast (1919).\nGerald Murphy produced only about a dozen works in less than ten years as a practicing artist, yet today he is recognized as a significant painter whose work prefigured the Pop art of the 1960s. The oil-on-canvas painting, Razor (1924), typifies Murphy’s work in its detailed depiction of commonplace objects.\nGeorgia O’Keeffe was one of the foremost painters of the 20th century. Widely known for her close-up flower paintings, O’Keeffe also famously painted urban and desert landscapes, including this oil-on-canvas painting, Black Mesa Landscape, New Mexico / Out Back of Marie’s II (1930).\nMan Ray was associated with some of the most important artistic movements of the 20th century—chief among them Dadaism and Surrealism—and is best known for his photography. His gelatin-silver print, Noire et Blanche (1926), is from a series of photographs juxtaposing a woman’s face with a Baule mask (or a replica) from West Africa.\nCharles Sheeler explored the balance between abstraction and realism in his photographs and paintings, which often depicted aspects of the mechanized modern world. By titling this oil-on-canvas painting American Landscape (1930), Sheeler explored the relationship between rural traditions and his modern subject matter.\nJoseph Stella, America’s first Futurist painter, is remembered for his multiple images of the Brooklyn Bridge and other iconic New York scenes. The oil-on-canvas painting, Brooklyn Bridge (1919-1920), has been read as a comment on the tension between technological achievement and the spiritual dimension implicit in any human endeavor.\nThe Modern Art in America stamp sheet will be issued in 2013.

{"question":"Between Roger Hornsby and Betty Robinson, who achieved more impressive statistical accomplishments in their respective sports?","answer":"Roger Hornsby achieved more impressive statistical accomplishments. He finished his career as the second-greatest hitter ever with a .358 batting average (second only to Ty Cobb), posted the fifth-best OPS+ of all time at 175, and eighth-best career OBP at .434. He also won seven batting titles and had four seasons with an OPS+ of at least 200. While Betty Robinson's achievements were groundbreaking as the first female Olympic 100 Meter Dash Gold Medalist in 1928 at age 16 and she tied the world record several times, Hornsby's career statistics place him among the all-time greatest players in baseball history.","context":["It's almost disappointing that I'm beginning my discussion...\nIt's almost disappointing that I'm beginning my discussion on the 1926 Cardinals with second baseman Roger Hornsby. While he still had a few good seasons left in the tank, Hornsby was near the end of a fantastic career when the Cardinals finally won their first World Series. Just the year before, in 1925, Hornsby won his sixth consecutive batting title (which I believe is still a National League record) by hitting .403. On top of that, he led the league in RBIS (143) and homeruns (39) to winthe second triple crown of his career.\nOh! Needing to positively update the overarching appearance for my own site. Opinions on the look at http://bedbugscalgary.ca? Sincerely an honest bed bug treatment service in Calgary if necessary within the general Alberta area. Send an opinion. With thanks!\nSimilar to players like Ty Cobb, it's hard to determine which season was Hornsby's best. In 1922, he won the triple crown and hit a career best 42 homeruns. In 1924, he hit a career high .424 and also set a career highwith a .507 OBP. And then in 1925, his third season above the .400 mark, he set career highs in slugging (.756) and OPS (1.245). In 1925, Hornsby also took over the managerial reigns from Branch Rickey part way through the season so it's fitting that the Cardinals won it all in Hornsby's first full season as skipper.\n1926 was definitely an off year for Hornsby. For the first time nine years, Hornsby wasn't in the top four in hitting. His OPS+ of 124 was his lowest season total ever unless you count his rookie season (1915) when he logged only 57 at bats. It was also the first time since 1915 that Hornsby didn't lead the Cardinals in OPS. Ironically, even in this off year, Hornsby finished eight in the National League in runs (96) and sixth in RBIs (93).\nDespite the Cardinals winning the World Series, Hornsby's story doesn't have a happy ending with the Cardinals. In December of 1926, the Cardinals traded Hornsby to the New York Giants for Frankie Frisch and Jimmy Ring. Ring went 0-4 in 27 innings for the Cardinals in 1927 and was traded after the season but Frisch was a major player on both the 1931 and 1934 World Series championship teams and managed the team from 1933 through 1938.\nHornsby wasn't quite done putting up great numbers after being traded by the Cardinals. He had a great 1927 season for the Giants (league leading OPS+ of 175 and second in hitting with .361) but was traded after the season to the Boston Braves. In 1928 he won his seventh and final batting title and notched his fourth and final season with at least an OPS+ of 200 (it was exactly 200 in 1928). Like the previous two seasons, Hornsby was again traded in the off season, this time to the Chicago Cubs.\nThat 1929 season was another historic one. He was voted the MVP for the second time in his career and belted 39 home runs. He also set a career high in runs scored with 156. He stuck with the Cubs through 1932, but after 1929, he never played more then 100 games in a season. He even made a final appearance with the Cardinals in 1932 even if it was for only 83 at bats.\nHornsby finished his career as the second greatest hitter ever with a .358 batting average. Only Ty Cobb had a higher mark. Hornsby's OPS+ of 175 is the fifth best mark of all time and his career OBP of .434 is the eighth best mark ever. In Bill James' Historical Baseball Abstract, Hornsby was chosen as the third greatest second baseman ever. Only Joe Morgan and Eddie Collins ranked higher but Hornsby's 1922 season is considered as the greatest season ever by a second baseman.\nKudos followers! I just texted my co-worker I would certainly reference their great ladder rack shops, http://www.texastruckracks.com through a site post.

Unquestionably an outstanding pest control services. I really love a wonderful proposal!\nhttp://www.imagelaundry.ca - Many thanks for your late-night work Brayan.\nPosted in Pets Post Date 02/25/2017","A Brief History\nOn March 22, 1997, figure skater Tara Lipinski, age 14, became the youngest skater ever to win a World Championship. (Okay, she was actually 14 years and 9 months old for you nitpickers.) Prior to her history making performance at the World competition, Tara had won the United States National Championship and in 1998 would go on to win the Gold Medal at the Winter Olympic Games. Lipinski is only 1 of many young athletes who have excelled beyond their seemingly tender years, and today we list 10 such young athletic stars that strike us as particularly worth noting. Many teens have made their way into the Major Leagues of baseball and have competed as Olympic athletes, but some sports have limited the age of professionals to a minimum of 18 years old, making really, really young stars impossible. Some young athletes have even lied about their age in order to compete at a higher level. So many are worth mentioning! As always, feel free to mention other notable people that should be on this list.\nQuestion for Students (and others): Who is your favorite young athletic star? Please let us know in the comments section below this article.\n1. Tara Lipiniski, World Champion Ice Skater, age 14.\nOf Polish heritage (you may have guessed from her last name), Lipinski was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 1982. Her early childhood was in New Jersey before her family moved to Texas, and then to Detroit where she could better train for figure skating. She actually started her ice skating career at the age of 6, though even before then became a roller-skater. In addition to her 1997 National and World Titles, Lipinski won the coveted Gold Medal at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan, as well as the 1996-1997 Grand Prix Gold Medal (Ladies’ Singles) in Hamilton, Ontario, and the 1997-1998 Grand Prix Gold Medal at Munich (Ladies’ Singles). After having to withdraw from the 1998 World Championships due to an infection occurred from having molars extracted, Lipinski turned professional. (See our article “10 Major Accomplishments by Young People” for more youthful achievements.)\n2. Joe Nuxhall, Major League Baseball Pitcher, age 15.\nIn 1944, while most American able bodied men were in the military service during World War II, this teen aged prodigy made his major league debut as a left handed pitcher at the tender age of 15, the youngest major leaguer ever. Joe was no flash in the pan as his career with the Cincinnati Reds lasted until 1966, although interrupted by stops in Kansas City and Los Angeles. Along the way he managed to set the team record for pitching appearances (pitching in 484 games) and compiled a record of 135 wins and 115 1osses with an ERA of .390. Joe’s career in the major leagues lasted only the one game in 1944, until he worked his way back up to the “Big Show” in 1952. After his retirement as a player in 1966, Nuxhall went into broadcasting, a second career that lasted until his death in 2007 at the age of 79. Nuxhall was a product of Hamilton, Ohio. Joe Nuxhall was a 2 time National League All Star and is an inductee to the Cincinnati Reds Hall of Fame.\n(Special Mention: Bob Feller of the Cleveland Indians, perhaps the greatest pitcher of all time, who made his debut with the Tribe in 1936 at the age of 17. Feller went on to a terrific major league career, a career with 4 of his best years taken out of the middle by his voluntary service in the US Navy during the war, serving aboard the battleship USS Alabama. Feller ended his career with a then record 3 no-hitters and a still record 12 1-hitters. In fact, the next nearest pitcher on the list since 1900 has only 6 1-hitters! Who knows what Feller may have done in his prime had he not been interrupted by war service.)\n3. Marjorie Gestring, Olympic Gold Medal Diver, age 13.\nA product of the Golden State (California), Gestring was born in 1922, and before she even turned 14 she had won an Olympic Gold Medal at the 1936 Berlin Summer Olympics in the 3 meter diving competition. At that time, Marjorie was the youngest Olympian ever to win a Gold Medal, and remains the second youngest to this date. Gestring added 3 National titles to her trove of awards, and in 1940, with World War II in progress, the US Olympic Committee awarded her an Olympic Gold Medal even though the Games were not held that year due to the war. Attempting a competitive comeback in 1948, Marjorie failed to make the US Olympic team. South Korean speed skater\nSpecial Mention: Kim Yun-mi broke Gestring’s age record at the 1994 Winter Olympics when she took the Gold Medal in the 3000 meter relay, a feat she repeated at the 1998 Winter Olympics.\n4. Nadia Comăneci, Olympic Gold Medal Gymnast, age 14.\nBorn in Onești, Romania in 1961, Nadia took the 1976 Summer Olympics and the world by storm by winning 3 Olympic Gold Medals in Gymnastics before she had turned 15 years old. Not only that, Nadia became the first ever Olympic gymnast to score a perfect 10 at an Olympic competition. For good measure she came back at the 1980 Olympic Games and won 2 additional Olympic Gold Medals. In all, Nadia earned 9 Olympic Medals, and won the hearts of millions of people across the world, greatly enhancing the popularity of the sport of gymnastics. Her official retirement ceremony took place in Bucharest in 1984. Nadia has lived in the United States since 1989, with her husband, US Olympic gymnast Bart Connor.\nSpecial Mention: Prior to Nadia’s groundbreaking performance in 1976, Soviet gymnast Olga Korbut was the darling of the gymnastics world when she won 3 Olympic Gold Medals in ladies Gymnastics in 1972 (Team, Balance Beam, and Floor) at the age of 17.\n5. Betty Robinson, Olympic Gold Medal 100 meter Dash, age 16.\nThe 1928 Summer Olympic Games in Amsterdam would be the debut of the Women’s 100 Meter Dash competition, and a 16 year old girl from Riverdale, Illinois (born 1911) would become the first ever female Olympic 100 Meter Dash Gold Medalist. She also won a Silver Medal at the Amsterdam Olympics in 1928 in the Women’s 4 X 100 meter relay, and won another Gold Medal at the 1936 Berlin Olympics, again in the 4 X 100 meter relay. Amazingly, Betty’s first ever race was in March of 1928, and at her second race ever she tied the 100 Meter Dash world record for women! Her Olympic Gold Medal 100 meter dash was only her 3rd race in competition, and she again tied the Women’s World Record in that event. She attended Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois. A victim in a serious plane crash in 1931, Betty was reportedly taken to the coroner’s office where a startled coroner found the injured girl was still alive, but later information proved that story to be mistaken. Unable to walk normally for the next 2 years, she of course missed out on the 1932 Olympics, but made her comeback in 1936 to earn that second Gold Medal. She went on a long life, dying in 1999 at the age of 87.\n6. Lexi Thompson, Women’s US Open Golf Qualifier, age 12.\nNot surprisingly still an amateur golfer at the age of 12, Lexi became the youngest ever golfer to qualify for the Women’s US Open golf tournament in 2007, and remember, although she was an amateur, she was competing against the best professionals and amateurs in the world for a spot on tournament roster! Lexi turned professional in 2010 at the age of 15, and in 2011 she became the youngest ever winner of a professional women’s golf tournament LPGA) at the age of 16. Thompson also became the youngest winner of a Ladies European golf tournament event in 2011, and at the age of 19 won her first major tournament, the 2014 Kraft Nabisco Championship, at the time the second youngest female major tournament winner. She is still playing golf at the advanced age of 24! Lexi is a native of Coral Springs, Florida, and stands 6 feet tall.\n7. Bob Mathias, Olympic Gold Medal Decathlon, age 17.\nBorn in Tulare, California in 1930, Mathias became the “World’s Greatest Athlete” by winning the 1948 Olympic Decathlon at the London Olympics at the age of 17, an incredible feat. Bob matched his remarkable performance of 1948 by winning the 1952 Olympic Gold Medal in Decathlon at the 1952 Olympic Games in Helsinki. Bob’s 1952 performance was so dominating that he set a World Record in the Decathlon for margin of victory. Mathias later served for 8 years as a US Representative to Congress from California and held other government service jobs. He died of cancer at the age of 76 in 2006. Mathias attended Stanford University and even played 2 years of college football.\n8. Wilfred Benítez, World Champion Boxer (Junior Welterweight Division), age 17.\nBoxing is a brutal, very brutal sport. People get killed from injuries incurred in the boxing ring every so often, so the feat of becoming a World Champion boxer at the age of 17 (apologies to Stevie Nicks) is remarkable. Born in Puerto Rico in 1958, Wilfred turned professional at the incredibly young age of 15! Benitez piled up 25 wins and 0 losses by the time in 1976 when he got his first shot at the Welterweight title, facing champion Antonio Cervantes. A 15 round battle ensued, and at the end Benitez became the youngest ever professional boxing champion. He went on to a stellar career, marked by notable bouts with Thomas Hearns, Sugar Ray Leonard, and Roberto Duran. His career record stood at 53 wins, 8 losses, and 1 draw when he retired in 1990. His nickname was “El Radar.”\n9. Mike Tyson, World Champion Boxer (Heavyweight Division), age 20.\nIron Mike Tyson has had a checkered life in and outside the ring, marred by allegations of domestic violence, possible juvenile felonies, and biting a chunk of ear out of Evander Holyfield during a Championship bout! Still, what he accomplished by gaining the Heavyweight Boxing Championship at the age of 20 in 1986 against Champ Trevor Berbick is truly amazing. Tyson had amassed 27 professional victories in the ring in 1985 and 1986 prior to winning the Heavyweight Belt, a daunting number of professional fights in only a little more than one year! An arrest for rape in 1991 resulted in a conviction for that crime in 1992, and a 3 year stretch in prison during what should have been the prime of his career. Tyson is forever branded by the US Federal Government as a “Sex Offender.”\n10. Al Kaline, American League Batting Champion, age 20.\nKaline joined the Detroit Tigers at the age of 18 in 1953, bypassing the minor league development phase. In his third year of major league baseball, he stunned the American League by winning the Batting Championship with a batting average of .340, becoming the youngest player to win a major league batting title. Not since Ty Cobb in 1907 had a 20 year old won a batting title in the major leagues, though Kaline edged out Cobb in age. Al Kaline went on to a stellar career, posting a .297 lifetime batting average, smacking 3007 hits, and slamming 399 home runs while appearing in 18 All Star Games and winning 10 Gold Glove Awards.\nYour readership is much appreciated!\nFor more information, please see…\nGelman, Steve.

{"question":"What are the structural components of a sandblast chamber, and what ventilation requirements are mandated for these facilities?","answer":"A sandblast chamber consists of several key components: the blast booth enclosure where the blasting occurs, a dust collector for removing airborne particles, a blast nozzle for directing abrasive particles, and an air compressor for providing pressure. Regarding ventilation, OSHA regulation 1910.94(a)(1)(viii) requires mechanical ventilation systems for removing contaminated air. These systems must include multiple elements: an enclosure or hood, ductwork, dust collecting equipment, an exhauster, and a discharge stack. The ventilation system is crucial for maintaining air quality and worker safety during sandblasting operations.","context":["A sandblast chamber is a controlled environment where the abrasive media is controlled, recovered, cleaned, and reused several times. The booths are designed to protect the workers from the harmful effects of sandblasting and contain the debris created by the sandblasting process. Sandblast booths are an essential part of the manufacturing process for many industries and effectively reduce worker exposure to harmful dust and debris.\nA sandblast chamber is where the sandblasting takes place. It is usually made of steel and has a door that allows workers to enter and exit. The booth also has ventilation to remove dust generated by such a process.\nBenefits Of Sandblast Chambers\nReuse Of Abrasive Media\nSandblasting is a process in which abrasive media are blasted at high velocity against a surface to clean or roughen it. The benefits of sandblasting chambers are numerous, but one of the most important is the recovery and reusing of abrasive media.\nIn a sandblaster, the dust is created in the same area where the operation occurs. By keeping the containment area free of dust and other airborne contaminants, you can ensure a safe and healthy workplace for everyone involved. Thus helping to keep the area clean and increasing the visibility of the sandblaster.\nIt makes them ideal for businesses that need to blast large, challenging objects. Chambers with this type of construction can also withstand high pressure and temperatures, making them perfect for companies that need to work at high speeds.\nSandblast booths can accommodate multiple projects and applications. However, using different media types should be avoided in the same booth to prevent cross-contamination. It is good to go if one uses the same abrasive media.\nOperators appreciate the safety of sandblasting chambers, as they are not exposed to the sandblasting process’s noise and dust. This is because they wear proper gear and air-breathing helmets. The controlled environment of the room also allows operators to work more efficiently and with greater precision. They also provide a space for sandblasting, preventing damage to nearby surfaces.\nComponents Of A Sandblasting Booth\nBlast Booth Enclosure\nThe blast room is the heart of the sandblasting booth. It is where the abrasive material is blasted onto the surface of the workpiece. It is designed to contain all of the debris created by the blasting process. The debris is then eliminated from the contaminated room via an effective ventilation system.\nThe dust collector removes airborne dust particles created by the blasting process. The type of dust collector used will dependupon the size of the booth. You must get the right size of booth suitable for the parts. Getting an overly-sized collector might add up to the project’s overall cost. The most common type of dust collector is a cartridge-style dust collector.\nThe most important part of this booth is the blast nozzle. This part of the pressure blaster directs the stream of abrasive particles at the workpiece. The blast nozzle must be appropriately aligned with the workpiece to ensure that the stream of abrasives hits the workpiece squarely.\nAnother critical component is the air compressor. It provides the air pressure needed to operate the pressure blaster.\nSandblast chambers are a great way to cleanse dirt, grime, and other particles from different surfaces. They are also effective in removing rust and other debris. You can use these chambers for metal, glass, and plastic materials. Wear appropriate safety gear for sandblasting chambers, such as respirators that cover your entire face. If you are considering buying chambers, do some research. Several high-quality custom-engineered booths are available from reputed suppliers.","Avoid Silicosis from Abrasive Sand Blasting\nQuick Tips #384\nAbrasive sand blasting is a common practice for workers who fabricate products made of metal. Sand blasting is used to remove rust or to clean metal surfaces of oils. Industries that rely on this sand blasting on a daily basis include painters who work on large structures like bridges, granite monument makers, foundries and shipbuilders.\nOne downside to the use of sand blasting is the media used; silica. The term \"silica\" broadly refers to the mineral compound silicon dioxide (SiO2). Although silica can be crystalline or amorphous in form, crystalline silica is more hazardous to employees. It is most commonly found in the form of quartz, but it is also found in substances such as cristobalite, tridymite and tripoli. Breathing crystalline silica dust poses an industrial hazard and can lead to severe health problems and even death.\nExposure to silica or crystalline silica can cause silicosis and a host of other illnesses. Silicosis is one of the world's oldest known occupational diseases, with reports of employees contracting the disease dating back to ancient Greece. OSHA regulates silica under the General Industry, Construction and Shipyard standards. Air sampling, ventilation, personal protective equipment, respirator usage, silica substitutes, blasting cabinets and room design are hazards addressed by OSHA within these standards.\nOSHA has a list of preferred solutions to help protect workers from exposure to silica during abrasive blasting. The most preferred method is to use a silica substitute. Next on OSHA’s list is implementing engineering controls such as ventilation, followed by improving work practices. OSHA’s final line of defense is the use of personal protective equipment such as respirators. For more on silica exposure and silicosis see our Quick Tips #354.\nWhen using silica in the workplace, the first action that needs to be completed is to see what, if any, protective measures need to be taken. To make this determination, collecting and measuring the concentration of silica in the air will need to be done. Once collected, the sample is sent to a laboratory for analysis. The results of this analysis will determine if better ventilation and/or a change in work practices or respiratory protection is needed. If it is required, OSHA advises that respiratory protection would be the last line of defense for choices of protection.\nTypically, air monitoring is done by an Industrial Hygienist. If there is not an Industrial Hygienist or safety professional available on your worksite, you may find on your own or consult the insurance carrier for your facility for a recommendation. Collecting an air sample is done using a sampling pump and filter cassettes. The pump will pull air from around the workers breathing zone and it will collect in the filter cassette. The person doing the sandblasting work and possibly the nearest workers, who may be exposed, would wear the pump and the cassette. After an eight hour work shift the cassettes will be collected and sent to a laboratory for analysis.\nWhen analyzing the silica content of the cassettes collected from your workplace, the lab will need to know the contents of the sample collected. For instance, the percentage of quartz, cristobalite, tridymite and respirable dust specific to your worksite needs to be taken into account to calculate the permissible exposure limit (PEL). The different percentages can change what the PEL is for your workplace. The make-up of the silica being used can be found in the SDS or product label.\nOSHA has a helpful calculator on its website called Advisor Genius which will let you input your numbers and information and come up with three different result types; PEL (calculated permissible limit for dust to which the worker may be exposed), Exposure (the actual amount of dust in your work environment) and Severity (this number tells you if you are above or below the limit). The permissible exposure limits for crystalline silica for General Industry, Construction and Maritime are all the same and can be found in OSHA regulation 1910.1000 Table Z-3. The limits listed for all the types of silica are 3mg/m3.\nAbrasive sand blasting is where the most severe cases of silicosis can occur. Many of these cases occur because the sand blasting is performed at outside locations where engineering controls, such as ventilation or dust collection, are not possible. The workers in these situations (and abrasive sandblasting in general) may benefit from using silica substitutes. Some of the possible substitutes are:\n|Aluminum Oxide||Glass Beads||Steel Grit|\n|Aluminum Shot||Melamine Plastic||Steel Shot|\n|Ambient Polycarbonate||Novaculite||Urea Plastic|\n|Apricot Pits||Polycarbonate||Walnut Shells|\n|Corn Cobs||Silicon Carbide||Wheat Grain|\n|Cryogenic Polycarbonate||Stainless Cast Shot||White Aluminum Oxide|\n|Emery||Stainless Cut Wire||Zircon|\nThe advantages of using a silica substitute outweigh using silica in abrasive sandblasting. Any health issues and healthcare costs related to silica would greatly reduced or eliminated. The time and cost of implementing and maintaining engineering controls would also be eliminated. The disadvantages are that the substitutes may not be as hard as a silica product; therefore, more of the substitute may need to be used to achieve the same result. It may also be more expensive. However, with more than two dozen substitute types available, there should be one product that will get your needed job done.\nEngineering Controls & Ventilation\nOSHA regulation 1910.94(a)(1)(viii) requires mechanical ventilation for the removal of contaminated air where abrasive sand blasting and silica use takes place. In protecting employees from contaminated air, engineering controls such as ventilation should be the first choice, after sourcing silica substitutes. This can be accomplished through a number of options. OSHA describes a ventilation system in 1910.94(a)(1)(viii) Exhaust Ventilation System. A system for removing contaminated air from a space, comprising two or more of the following elements (a) enclosure or hood, (b) duct work, (c) dust collecting equipment, (d) exhauster and (e) discharge stack.\nThere are a variety of ways that sandblasting can be accomplished. The most common types of sandblasting performed are in blasting rooms, cabinets or in open air. A blasting room is an enclosed room where the operator works inside the area, moving around freely with respiratory protection or supplied air with equipment such as an accepted blasting helmet. Sandblasting in a blasting room ( Fig. 1 below), is generally performed where larger pieces need to be sand blasted. Cabinet sandblasting (Fig. 2 below), another common application, is generally performed in an enclosed cabinet where the operator stands outside the cabinet and operates a sand blast nozzle through openings in the cabinet wall. Gloves usually extend into the cabinet and the silica dust is evacuated to a dust collection and ventilation system. Where a room or cabinet enclosure is not feasible, due to size or logistics, abrasive sandblasting is done in an outdoor location. The ventilation needed is dependent on each situation. OSHA standard 1910.94 (a)(4)(i) gives the requirements on the construction, installation and inspection requirements for abrasive blasting ventilation as set forth by the American National Standard Institute (ANSI) which is specified by OSHA.\nRespiratory Protection & PPE Respirators\nThere are only 4 types of respiratory protection that are suitable and National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) approved for abrasive blasting. These types are:\n- Continuous-flow respirator with a loose fitting hood and an APF* of 25\n- Continuous-flow respirator with a tight-fitting hood and an APF of 50\n- Positive pressure respirator with a tight- fitting half-mask face piece and an APF of 1000\n- Pressure-demand or positive-pressure respirator containing a tight-fitting face piece and an APF of 2000\n* APF = assigned protection factor from NIOSH\nAir purifying respirators and powered air purifying respirators (PAPR’s) are not recommended for abrasive blasting operations but they may be suitable for auxiliary work, such as clean-up operations.\nIn very limited situations, the 29 CFR 1910.94(a)(5)(ii)(b) interpretation only provides for limited deviation, such as a breakdown in the air supply or when the abrasive blasting respirator is temporarily unavailable. Only then can a dust filter respirator can be used as interim protection. If it does not provide additional face and eye protection supplementary equipment will be needed. This is in accordance with the OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.94 (a)(5)(v)(b).\nWhether it be General Industry 29 CFR 1910, Construction 29 CFR 1926 or Shipyard 29 CFR 1915 standards, all these OSHA standards have PPE requirements that need to be followed. The requirements may also intertwine with each other such as the shipyard PPE standard 1915 referring to the 1910 standard for respiratory protection. All three industry standards are similar in their PPE requirements also. The following is an example of the requirements from the shipbuilding 1915 standard for PPE.\nWorkers performing abrasive blasting should wear:\n- A protective helmet (if the respirator design does not provide this protection and there is potential for head injury); (1915.155)\n- Heavy canvas or leather gloves and aprons (or equivalent protection) to protect from the impact of abrasives; (1915.34(c)(3)(iv))\n- Safety shoes or boots; (1915.156)\n- Hearing protectors to reduce noise levels below the OSHA PEL’s; (1910.95)\nAn example of typical PPE worn by a worker when performing abrasive blasting is shown in Fig.3.\nAbrasive blasting can create a host of safety factors, considerations and necessary protections when it comes to employees in any industry in which it is performed. To help keep employees who are performing abrasive blasting and those in the areas around them safe, NIOSH has a list of recommendations. They recommend:\n- Using a silica substitute and that silica only be used as a last resort.\n- Exhaust systems and other dust controls be used as the primary means of protection.\n- Supplemental NIOSH approved respirators be used when engineering controls cannot prevent exposures below the recommended limits.\n- Environmental monitoring be conducted in all sandblasting operations to help insure employees are not overexposed and receive the proper PPE.\n- If silica sand is used, only the highest level NIOSH approved respiratory protection, such as positive pressure or pressure- demand hood or full facepiece should be used.\n- Respirators should be properly fitted according to the manufacturer’s instructions, NIOSH guidelines and the OSHA standard 29 CFR 1910.134.\nFollowing OSHA regulations and NIOSH recommendations will help keep those performing abrasive blasting (and those that are in and around the operation) safe and healthy.\nSources for Information:\nFind even more information you can use to help make informed decisions about the regulatory issues you face in your workplace every day.

{"question":"I need help understanding infant formula carbohydrate sources and their environmental impact - which ingredients are considered most and least desirable, while also considering sustainability factors?","answer":"In infant formulas, lactose is considered the most desirable 'clean' carbohydrate source, being the preferred option in 100% lactose-based formulas like Bobbie, Enfamil's Enspire, and Similac's Pure Bliss. Corn syrup solids, while different from high-fructose corn syrup, are increasingly avoided by consumers. Brown rice syrup is falling out of favor due to potential arsenic concerns, and maltodextrin is often viewed as highly processed. From a sustainability perspective, ingredients like palm oil are particularly problematic, as palm oil production leads to deforestation of tropical rainforests and threatens endangered species. This environmental impact has led many manufacturers to switch to alternative oils like safflower, soy, or coconut oil. The industry is increasingly focused on both ingredient quality and environmental sustainability, with many companies seeking certification from organizations like the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO).","context":["April 2021 Issue\nInfant Nutrition: New Infant Formula Innovations\nBy Diana K. Rice, RD, LD, CLEC\nVol. 23, No. 4, P. 16\nCompanies are meeting consumer demand for more healthful ingredients and ‘cleaner’ formulations.\nWhile it’s widely recognized that breastmilk is the ideal food for infants, more than 80% of infants will receive some formula, either exclusively or in combination with breastmilk.1,2\nGone are the days of mixing evaporated milk and Karo syrup in home kitchens, a popular method of feeding babies in the 1950s. The American infant formula industry is regulated by the FDA, which sets standards for nutrient composition, allowable ingredients, and manufacturing processes for today’s commercially available formulas. Formulas must meet certain levels of each of the macro- and micronutrients deemed critical for infant nutrition. Standard formulas are made from nonfat cow’s milk with additional sources of fat and carbohydrates to closely mimic the nutrient composition of breastmilk.\nHistorically, consumers often frowned upon infant formulas, believing they were made with low-quality ingredients. But as consumer demand for food products made with higher-quality ingredients has soared over the past several years, manufacturers began producing a wider variety of infant formulas in various categories to meet the moment of greater health consciousness. Similac was the first mainstream company to introduce organic and GMO-free infant formulas in 2006 and 2015, respectively.3,4 Now, nearly every major infant formula maker offers these options. Other recent innovations include formulas made with A2 beta-casein and those that meet both the FDA’s and European Commission’s safety standards. And as consumers continued to meticulously read ingredient labels, boutique brands, such as Happy Baby and Bobbie, and the larger companies, Similac and Enfamil, began advertising what isn’t in their formulas, particularly palm oil and corn syrup solids.\nThese innovations have made it easier for families that can’t or don’t want to breast-feed to choose infant formula. “In the present moment, I think we’re finally seeing a push toward ‘informed is best,’ with families wanting to know and understand what the data really say about breast-feeding benefits and formula-feeding risks,” says Mallory Whitmore, MEd, certified infant feeding technician at The Formula Mom, LLC, in Franklin, Tennessee. “There’s both a growing sense of self-assuredness and bodily autonomy,” she says. “This is empowering families to make feeding choices based not on what’s recommended across the board but instead based on what makes sense for them.”\nStill, many families that choose formula have the same high standards for the product as they do for other foods they consume, if not higher because formula is their infant’s sole nutrition source. And formula manufacturers are eagerly meeting these standards, especially for the segment of the population willing to spend sometimes as much as three times the cost of store-brand formulas for these benefits. What follows is a discussion on some of the latest infant formula product innovations in a variety of categories.\nOrganic and Non-GMO\nIncreased consumer demand for organic and GMO-free food products has spurred the organic and GMO-free infant formula segment—and the market is booming. The global organic infant formula market is projected to reach $7.75 billion by 2023.5 Demand for organic is so high that even Walmart’s Parent’s Choice and Amazon’s Mama Bear formulas have jumped into the game, competing with Similac’s two organic options. Specialty brands, including Happy Baby, Earth’s Best, and brand-new player Bobbie also tout organic infant formula products.\nAny formula with a USDA Organic certification also must be free of GMO ingredients. But many formulas that lack the USDA Organic designation still prominently advertise their GMO-free status, including Similac’s Pro-Advance and Pro-Sensitive options as well as some of the nonorganic house brands from Walmart, Target, Amazon, and Costco’s Kirkland line.\nDespite these claims, the question is, “Are these formulas any more healthful for babies?” According to Crystal Karges, MS, RDN, IBCLC, maternal child health specialist at Crystal Karges Nutrition in San Diego, “Organic formula may be a more appropriate option for babies with compromised immune systems or underlying health conditions, as it can help decrease [health risks] that may be associated with pesticide exposure. But this doesn’t make organic formula nutritionally superior to standard infant formula.”\nAs for GMOs, the USDA maintains that GMO foods are just as safe and healthful as their non-GMO counterparts. Consumer opinions vary concerning this, so having a variety of options on the market to meet consumer preferences is beneficial.\nEuropean Style Formula\nOver the past several years, a strong trend emerged involving the importation of infant formulas produced in Europe. European formula brands such as HiPP, Holle, and Lebenswert aren’t selling their products in the United States, but individual Americans and third-party vendors are going to great lengths to procure it for infants in the United States.\nWhy would they do this when plenty of safe, FDA-approved formulas are available in the United States? “Parents are drawn to European formulas because they perceive them to be higher-quality or ‘cleaner’ than formulas available in the US,” Whitmore says. “The European Commission has stricter guidelines than the FDA, including prohibitions on the use of corn syrup, corn syrup solids, and GMOs, and specific guidelines and limits for the use of sucrose. For some parents, the benefits of these stricter regulations, requirements, and allowances outweigh the risks of importing.”\nHowever, importing and selling European formula in the United States is illegal. Another risk is that the foreign instruction labels can lead to parents improperly mixing the formula, which can present a danger to infants.\nBobbie Organic Infant Formula, a product that launched in the United States in January 2021, aims to meet the demand for European formula while also safely meeting FDA standards. “We couldn’t understand why, as modern working mothers who wanted the best for our babies, we were turning to a black market of European formula to feel okay about our feeding choices,” says Sarah Hardy, chief operating officer and cofounder of Bobbie.\nCurrently, Bobbie is the only FDA-approved formula that also meets the nutrition standards of the European Commission, but Similac’s Pure Bliss cites “European crafted nutrition” in its marketing messages, a reference to the product’s grass-fed milk and DHA content, which are more common in European products.\nIn the past 12 months, Similac, Gerber, and Enfamil each introduced infant formulas made with only A2 beta-casein. These three products are the first of their kind to hit the American market and are an extension of the larger trend of consumers seeking A2 milk products as a way to enjoy cow’s milk without gastrointestinal distress.\nResearch suggests that of the two types of beta-casein present in cow’s milk, A1 and A2, the A1 protein may be responsible for symptoms such as gas and constipation in children and adults. Notably, A2-based products (including but not limited to infant formulas) are more popular in Europe and Australia than they are in the United States, although the primary manufacturer of A2 milk in the United States, The a2 Milk Company, recently has enjoyed a 91% jump in US revenue from 2019 to 2020, demonstrating a growing US interest in these products.6\nTo date, infants suffering from gastrointestinal distress usually are given formulas free of lactose or those made with hydrolyzed proteins, so the addition of A2 formulas to the American market theoretically gives parents of infants with tummy troubles another option. Technically, however, no research has evaluated the effect of A2-based formulas on digestive distress in infants, although studies to do so currently are underway.\nFree From Corn Syrup and Palm Oil\nIn keeping with the trend toward “clean” ingredients, consumers also are increasingly seeking infant formulas that don’t contain palm oil as a fat source or corn syrup solids as a carbohydrate source.\nMany parents want to avoid palm oil because of concerns over deforestation related to palm oil’s production.7 They question whether palm oil is a healthful choice for infants and take issue with palm olein oil, the form used in infant formulas that may lead to constipation.8 Other research suggests it inhibits calcium absorption in infants’ intestines.9,10 For these reasons, Similac and Bobbie don’t use palm oil in any of their products, and instead use safflower, soy, or coconut oil.\nWith regard to corn syrup, it’s important to know that corn syrup solids aren’t the same as high-fructose corn syrup (HFCS), an ingredient that many consumers avoid. Corn syrup is derived from corn and composed of long chains of glucose linked together. “This provides necessary carbohydrate energy for the infant,” says Brian Liddell, DO, FAAP, a board-certified pediatrician with The Doctor and The Dietitian, a Boise, Idaho–based company that offers feeding advice to families. “HFCS is different,” he continues. “It has been processed such that some of the glucose has been converted to fructose.” But HFCS isn’t an ingredient used in any infant formula.\nStill, consumers see the words “corn syrup” on an ingredient label and are more likely to put the product back on the shelf. Brown rice syrup also is falling out of favor among consumers due to concerns it may contain unsafe levels of arsenic. Maltodextrin has a reputation for being highly processed, which leaves lactose as the preferred “clean” carbohydrate source in infant formulas. One hundred percent lactose-based formulas are more common in Europe, but FDA-approved options that exclusively rely on lactose include Bobbie, Enfamil’s Enspire, Similac’s Pure Bliss, and Happy Baby’s nonsensitive options.\nSoy formulas can’t rely on lactose as their carbohydrate source, so sweeteners often are added—which sometimes are off-putting to parents. “One of the big questions I get about soy formulas is why they contain added sweeteners, like corn and brown rice syrup,” says Alex Caspero, MA, RD, cofounder of Plant-Based Juniors in St. Louis. “Many of my parents are hoping to find a formula that doesn’t contain these, but the reality is that soy formulas must contain added sweeteners so they’re closer to [the nutritional composition of] human milk. Soy doesn’t contain enough carbohydrate or fat and therefore must be supplemented with additional sweeteners and oils.”\nIn addition to the new innovations in infant formulas, parents are turning to beverages marketed as toddler formulas for their infants. Technically, toddler formulas are products marketed for children aged nine months or older, and they don’t meet the FDA’s standards for infant formulas intended for babies aged 0 through 9 months. They’re marketed as a nutritional stepping stone for children who may not be ready for cow’s or plant-based milk, but most experts agree that while they’re safe for toddlers to consume, they aren’t necessary. “An otherwise healthy child does not need or benefit from the consumption of a toddler formula,” Liddell says. “Because toddler formulas tend to contain more sodium, fat, and sugar than infant formulas, they should not be given to infants under 9 months old. In addition, infant formulas are strictly regulated by the FDA, but the same requirements do not apply to toddler formulas. So often, their composition varies greatly from product to product.”\nUltimately, the growing number of FDA-approved infant formulas is a benefit to American families. But it’s important to help parents differentiate between what’s trendy and what will benefit their infant’s health and to steer them away from questionable products such as imported European formulas and toddler formulas for infants.\nOf course, the right option among the various FDA-approved formulas for infants will vary from baby to baby. “Whenever I’m asked about my favorite formula, my response is always, ‘whatever your baby accepts and that is accessible and affordable for you,’” Caspero says. “There are plenty of options out there, and I think the biggest thing to focus on is access and what’s best for the baby.”\n— Diana K.

To cope with the worlds’ demands for vegetable oils and to minimise negative effects for the environment and its people, palm oil must be produced in a sustainable way.\nScroll down for information on how you can shop sustainably this Christmas\nTwycross Zoo’s Palm Oil Policy\nSince 2016, the team here at Twycross Zoo has been conducting palm oil audits to ensure the products we purchase contain certified sustainable palm oil (CSPO) by the round table of sustainable palm oil (RSPO). Whenever available we aim to purchase products containing identity preserved, segregated or at least mass-balanced CSPO. Suppliers’ commitments to CSPO are reviewed each year to ensure that they are in line with our policy requirements, and if necessary, we will change suppliers to meet the palm oil policy.\nMany species like the critically-endangered Bornean orang utans are affected by deforestation to make way for palm oil plantations. As part of the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria’s (EAZA) European Endangered Species Programme (EEP) for Bornean orang-utans which aim to conserve a genetically healthy population of the species in captivity. We have had great success with our two most recent babies Basuki and Kayan, both born in 2017. For more information on Twycross zoo’s palm oil policy click here.\nHow can you shop sustainably this Christmas\nRecent EU legislation changes mean “palm oil” must be listed on every product sold in the UK, some of which will state if the palm oil is sustainably sourced or not.\nCheck your products for their palm oil content and favour products with sustainably sourced palm oil over not sustainably sourced.\nIf your favourite product or brand does not state if the item contains sustainable palm oil, you should contact them to find out. Facebook and Twitter are great for communicating with companies, but email and letters also work great for this!\nLook for these labels on products:\nEnsures products are made with certified palm oil. Palm oil has been produced in a socially and environmentally responsible way.\nGreen Palm Label\nIndicates products in support of the transition to certified palm oil.\nDid you know approximately 19% of worldwide global palm oil is RSPO certified – consumers choosing products/brands which use sustainable palm oil will force other companies and suppliers to switch to sustainable palm oil.\nProducts & Brands that use Sustainable Palm Oil\nDo you know any other brands using sustainble palm oil?

{"question":"How does elastic scattering differ from absorption in light-matter interaction?","answer":"In elastic scattering, when light interacts with a molecule, the molecule almost immediately (on a femtosecond or shorter time scale) returns to its original internal energy state by re-emitting radiation of the same energy as the absorbed radiation, though possibly in a different direction. It can be thought of as light simply changing direction without energy exchange. In contrast, absorption involves the annihilation of light, leaving the atom or molecule in an excited state with higher internal energy, and this absorbed radiant energy may be converted into thermal or chemical energy.","context":["The SRTE: Heuristic Development\nThis page presents a heuristic or qualitative derivation of the the scalar radiative transfer equation (SRTE). The end results (Eqs. (9), (10), or (12)) are correct, but the steps of the derivation are physically incorrect because polarization is ignored. In addition, the derivation of this page gives no way to estimate the errors that result from ignoring polarization. Nevertheless, this form of the derivation of the SRTE is found is almost every textbook and it does serve as a useful way to remember the various physical processes that contribute to light propagation in an absorbing and scattering medium like the ocean or atmosphere. This derivation is also of historical interest because it shows how the founding fathers of radiative transfer theory proceeded in order to obtain a governing equation (e.g., Preisendorfer (1965), page 65) before the link between fundamental physics and radiative transfer theory was ﬁrmly established.\nThe Level 2 pages beginning at The General Vector Radiative Transfer Equation outline the steps of a physically rigorous derivation of various levels of RTEs, ending with the SRTE seen below.\nTo the extent that polarization can be ignored, the SRTE expresses conservation of energy written for a collimated beam of radiance traveling through an absorbing, scattering and emitting medium. We thus begin by considering the various processes that can occur when light interacts with an atom or molecule.\nThe light (electromagnetic radiation) may be annihilated, leaving the atom or molecule in an excited state with higher internal (electronic, vibrational, or rotational) energy. All or part of the absorbed radiant energy may be subsequently converted into thermal (kinetic) or chemical energy (manifested, for example, in the formation of new chemical compounds during photosynthesis). The annihilation of the light and conversion of its energy into a nonradiant form is called absorption. (See The Physics of Absorption page for further discussion of the quantum mechanics of absorption processes.) If the molecule almost immediately (on a femtosecond () or shorter time scale) returns to its original internal energy state by re-emitting radiation of the same energy as the absorbed radiation (but probably traveling in a diﬀerent direction from the original radiation), the process is called elastic scattering. Because of the extremely short time required for these events, elastic scattering can reasonably be thought of as the light interacting with the molecule and simply “changing direction” without an exchange of energy with the scattering molecule.\nThe excited molecule also may emit radiation of lower energy (longer wavelength) than the incident radiation. The molecule thus remains in an intermediate excited state and may at a later time emit new radiation and return to its original state, or the retained energy may be converted to thermal or chemical energy. Indeed, if the molecule is initially in an excited state, it may absorb the incident light and then emit light of greater energy (shorter wavelength) than the absorbed light, thereby returning to a lower energy state. In either case the scattered (emitted) radiation has a diﬀerent wavelength than the incident (absorbed) radiation, and the processes is called inelastic scattering. One important example of this process in the ocean is Raman scattering by water molecules. Fluorescence is an absorption and re-emission process that occurs on a time scale of to . If the re-emission requires longer than about , the process is usually called phosphorescence. The physical and chemical processes that lead to the vastly diﬀerent times scales of Raman scattering vs. ﬂuorescence vs. phosphorescence are much diﬀerent. The distinctions between the very short time scale of Raman “scattering” versus the longer time scale of ﬂuorescence “absorption and re-emission” do not concern us in the derivation of the time-independent RTE. However, the terminology has evolved somewhat diﬀerently, e.g., Raman scattering usually refers to “incident” and “scattered” wavelengths, whereas ﬂuorescence usually refers to “excitation” and “emission” wavelengths.\nThe reverse process to absorption is also possible, as when chemical energy is converted into light; this process is called emission. An example of this is bioluminescence, in which an organism converts part of the energy from a chemical reaction into light.\nIn order to formulate the RTE, it is convenient to imagine the total light ﬁeld as many beams of electromagnetic radiation of various wavelengths coursing in all directions through each point of a water body. We then consider a single one of these beams, which is traveling in some direction and has wavelength . This beam and the processes aﬀecting it are illustrated in Fig. 1.\nNow think of all the ways in which that beam’s energy can be decreased or increased. Bearing in mind the preceding comments, the following six processes are both necessary and suﬃcient to write down an energy balance equation for a beam of light on the phenomenological level:\n- Process 1\n- loss of energy from the beam through annihilation of the light and conversion of radiant energy to nonradiant energy (absorption)\n- Process 2\n- loss of energy from the beam through scattering to other directions without change in wavelength (elastic scattering)\n- Process 3\n- loss of energy from the beam through scattering (perhaps to other directions) with change in wavelength (inelastic scattering)\n- Process 4\n- gain of energy by the beam through scattering from other directions without change in wavelength (elastic scattering)\n- Process 5\n- gain of energy by the beam through scattering (perhaps from other directions) with a change in wavelength (inelastic scattering)\n- Process 6\n- gain of energy by the beam through creation of light by conversion of nonradiant energy into radiant energy (emission)\nNext we must mathematically express how these six processes change the radiance as the beam travels a short distance in passing through a small volume of water, which is represented by the blue rectangle of Fig. 1.\nProcesses 1 and 3. It is reasonable to assume that the change in radiance while traveling distance due to absorption is proportional to the incident radiance, i.e., the more incident radiance there is, the more is lost to absorption. Thus we can write\nHere denotes the change in between and . The minus sign is necessary because the radiance decreases (energy is disappearing, so is negative) along . Referring back to Eq. (1) on the Inherent Optical Properties page, it is easy to see that the present Eq. (1) is just the deﬁnition of the absorption coeﬃcient written as a change in radiance over distance , rather than as a change in absorptance. Thus the proportionality constant in Eq. (1) is just the absorption coeﬃcient as deﬁned on the IOP page. Note that absorption at the wavelength of interest accounts both for energy converted to non-radiant form (absorption) and for energy that disappears from wavelength and re-appears at a diﬀerent wavelength (inelastic scattering). Either process leads to a loss of energy from the beam at wavelength .\nProcess 2. In a similar fashion, the loss due to elastic scattering out of the beam direction into all other directions can be written as\nwhere is the scattering coeﬃcient as deﬁned on the IOP page.\nProcess 4. This process accounts for elastic scattering from all other directions into the beam direction . Figure 2 shows Fig. 1 redrawn to illustrate scattering along path length from one direction into the direction of interest. These incident and ﬁnal directions correspond to scattering angle as shown in Fig. 2.\nRecalling from Eq. (2) of the IOP page that one deﬁnition of the volume scattering function is scattered intensity per unit incident irradiance per unit volume, we can write\nHere is the intensity exiting the scattering volume at location in direction . All of this intensity is created along by scattering from direction into , so = . The incident irradiance is computed on a surface normal to the incident beam direction, as illustrated by the dotted lines in Fig. 2. We can rewrite as the incident radiance times the solid angle of the incident beam:\nNext recall from the Geometrical Radiometry page that intensity is radiance times area. Thus the intensity created by scattering along pathlength and exiting the scattering volume over an area can be written as\nwhere is the radiance created by scattering along and exiting the scattering volume over a surface area . Using Eqs. (4) and (5) in (3) and writing the scattering volume as gives\nThis equation gives the contribution to by scattering from one particular direction . However, ambient radiance may be passing through the scattering volume from all directions. We can sum up the contributions to from all directions by integrating the right hand side of Eq. (6) over all directions,\nwhere we have written the element of solid angle in terms the angles using Eq. (6) from the Geometry page.\nProcesses 5 and 6. Process 5 accounts for radiance created along pathlength in direction at wavelength by inelastic scattering from other all other wavelengths . Each such process, such as Raman scattering by water molecules or ﬂuorescence by chlorophyll or CDOM molecules, requires a separate mathematical formulation to specify how radiance is absorbed from an incident beam at wavelength and converted to the wavelength of interest.\nProcess 6 accounts for radiance created de novo by emission, e.g. by bioluminescence, and each emission process again requires a separate formulation to deﬁne how the light is emitted as a function of location, direction, and wavelength. Those detailed formulations can be complex and will be treated elsewhere (pages under development). For the moment, we can simply include a generic source function that represents creation of radiance along pathlength in direction at wavelength by any inelastic scattering or emission process. Thus we write just\nwithout specifying the mathematical form of the source function S.\nWe can now sum of the various contributions to the changes in L along . We can also take the conceptual limit of and write\nThe net change in radiance due to all six radiative processes is the sum of the right hand sides of Eqs. (1), (2) , (7), and (8). We thus obtain an equation relating the changes in radiance with distance along a given beam direction to the optical properties of the medium and the ambient radiance in other directions:\nThis is one form of the SRTE, written for changes in radiance along the beam path.\nIn oceanography, it is usually convenient to use a coordinate system with the depth being normal to the mean sea surface and positive downward. Thus depth is a more convenient spatial coordinate than location along the beam path. Changes in are related to changes in as shown in Fig. 1: . Using this in Eq. (9), assuming that the ocean is horizontally homogeneous, and recalling that , we get\nThis equation expresses location as geometric depth and the IOPs in terms of the beam attenuation and the volume scattering function .\nOther forms of the RTE are often used. The nondimensional optical depth is deﬁned by\nDividing Eq. (10) by and using (11) gives the SRTE written in terms of optical depth. It is also common to use as the polar angle variable. Recalling Eq. (7) of the Volume Scattering Function page, we can factor the volume scattering function into the scattering coeﬃcient times the scattering phase function . Finally, recalling the deﬁnition of the albedo of single scattering , we can re-write Eq. (??) as\nThis equation now shows all quantities as a function of optical depth.\nForm (12) of the SRTE yields an important observation: In source-free () waters, any two water bodies having the same single-scattering albedo , phase function , and boundary conditions (including incident radiances) will have the same radiance distribution at a given optical depth. This is why optical depth, albedo of single scattering, and phase function are often the preferred variables in radiative transfer theory. Note, for example, that doubling the absorption and scattering coeﬃcients and leaves unchanged, so that the radiance remains the same for a given optical depth. However, the geometric depth corresponding to a given optical depth will diﬀerent after such a change in the IOPs.\nWe can convert geometric depth to optical depth, or vice versa, by integrating Eq. (11):\nNote that the optical depth corresponding to a given geometric depth is usually diﬀerent for diﬀerent wavelengths, because the beam attenuation depends on wavelength. This is inconvenient for oceanographic work, so Eq. (10) is usually the preferred form of the SRTE for oceanography.\nWe have now derived the SRTE in a form adequate for much oceanographic work. Technically, the SRTE is a linear integrodiﬀerential equation because it involves both an integral and a derivative of the unknown radiance. This makes solving the equation for given IOPs and boundary conditions quite diﬃcult. Fortunately, the radiance appears only to the ﬁrst power. Nevertheless, there are almost no analytic (i.e., pencil and paper) solutions of the SRTE except for trivial special cases, such as non-scattering waters. Sophisticated numerical methods therefore must be employed to solve the SRTE for realistic oceanic conditions.\nAs mentioned at the start, the development on this page has been for unpolarized light. In a sense, this is always incorrect because polarization is an inherent property of electromagnetic waves (light in particular). Even if the incident beam is unpolarized, scattering (either by particles within the water or by reﬂection and transmission by the air-water surface) induces polarization. Thus underwater radiance in a particular direction is usually at least partially polarized. Nevertheless, the unpolarized, or scalar RTE (SRTE), derived here gives suﬃciently accurate solutions for many (but not all) oceanographic applications. There are three main reasons for the utility of the SRTE in underwater optics:\n- The particles responsible for scattering within the ocean are usually much larger than the wavelength of light. Polarization by scattering is greatest for particles much smaller than the wavelength (for example, Rayleigh scattering by water molecules). The larger the particle, the less polarization is induced by scattering of unpolarized sun light.\n- Multiple scattering is almost always signiﬁcant underwater. Multiple scattering tends to depolarized the radiance, i.e., reduce the overall degree of polarization induced by single scattering events.\n- Irradiances are often the radiometric quantity of interest. Irradiances are computed from integration of the radiance over direction, which tends to average out diﬀerent polarizations in diﬀerent directions.\nHowever, if very accurate results are needed (e.g., radiance with an error of less than 10% in a given direvction), or if the state of polarization itself is of interest, then a polarized or vector RTE (VRTE), must be used. The VRTE is more complicated than the SRTE developed here. The Level 2 page on The VRTE develops the VRTE in a form suitable for oceanography."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d34c5b13-42d2-42cd-84a9-8b51a7c39c93>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences in microbial diversity research approaches between Antarctic lakes and urban river systems?","answer":"In Antarctic lakes, researchers focus on taking sediment cores to study both present-day microorganisms and reconstruct past climates through microfossils and biochemical markers left by cyanobacteria, with some cores dating back 120,000 years. In contrast, urban river systems like the Nanfei River are studied by analyzing current surface sediment samples using high-throughput sequencing technology, focusing on how different land uses (urban, suburban, industrial, rural) affect bacterial community structures. The river studies emphasize measuring specific parameters like pH, CEC, TOC, DOC, and various nitrogen forms to understand their influence on bacterial communities, while Antarctic research emphasizes temporal changes and adaptation to extreme conditions.","context":["Elie Verleyen: Antarctica Through the Microscope\nFormer InBev-Baillet Latour laureate Elie Verleyn returned to Antarctica this year to do some work for BELDIVA (Belgian Microbial Diversity Project in Antarctica). Biologists are trying to get a better picture of the microbial diversity in the region and how this diversity might change as the climate warms.\nWhat are your objectives this season with the BELDIVA project?\nBELDIVA is a biodiversity project aimed at studying the microorganisms in different habitats in the vicinity of the PEA station. This season we had three main objectives:\n- Sample the open-top chambers we installed close to PEA and replace data loggers, which have been measuring temperature and humidity since January 2011.\n- Replace temperature data loggers in water from cryoconite holes near Utsteinen Nunatak.\n- Sample contemporary microbial communities in lakes and extract sediment cores.\nWhat are open-top chambers and what are you studying with them?\nWe installed a number of open-top chambers two years ago on areas of exposed rock and soil in different regions around the station. Open top chambers are mini-greenhouses used to experimentally increase the temperature of a small area of the soil in order to mimic future climate warming and see how the microbial communities change in response. During the austral summer, temperatures in these open-top chambers can be up to 5-10°C higher than the surrounding terrain.\nEvery year we collect the temperature and humidity data loggers, which were placed inside the open top chambers for an entire seasonal cycle, and take samples to be analyzed in the lab back at Ghent University and the University of Liège to see how the microbial communities are being affected by the very localized change in climate.\nZorigto Namsaraev, who had been working on the BELDIVA project in previous years, set up the open top chambers two years ago. How long will you leave them there?\nWe plan to leave them there for five years at least. Every year we'll take regular samples and see what kind of results we get during the five years the project is running. However the conditions must be good for sampling. For example, when the open top chambers are covered with snow – as was the case with some of them this year – it is impossible to sample microbial biofilms.\nWe can also leave the open top chambers in place even longer. Whether or not we'll be able to come back regularly to take samples will depend on financing, which comes from BELSPO.\nWhy did you choose to put the open-top chambers in the places you put them?\nThe locations were chosen based on their exposure to sun, the kind of gravel or rocks in the area. We chose a number of different environments in the area so we could look at how future climate change affects different kinds of communities of microorganisms.\nWhat are cryoconite holes and why are you studying them?\nAnother objective was to take samples from cryoconite holes. Cryoconite holes are pockets of liquid water on the top of the ice sheet. These pockets form when a cryoconite (like a stone or other piece of dark detritus that has lower albedo than the ice around it) falls on the ice sheet. As the sun hits the cryoconite and heats it up, it melts the ice around it, and gradually sinks into the ice. Once it gets deep enough, the surface of the water re-freezes, creating a pocket of liquid water.\nWhy are cryoconite holes interesting?\nThere are a lot of microorganisms living in the water, some of which may only be found in Antarctica. For example, during the last glacial period, a lot of the currently ice-free areas near the coast were ice-covered. It's possible that some organisms were able to survive the spread of the glaciers in cryoconite holes. This remains to be seen, of course. We need to do more research.\nWould you be able to find certain unique species of microorganisms you would not find elsewhere in cryoconites holes?\nWe were able to take samples from a number of cryoconite holes last season. They will be analyzed together with the samples taken this year using state-of-the-art molecular techniques. This will allow us to assess whether the microbial communities living in cryoconite holes are different from those in lakes or wet soils, for example.\nCan you tell us a bit more about the surface lakes you're looking at?\nOur goal was to take sediment cores from lakes in the area around PEA. We're interested not only in studying the present-day microorganisms in the sediment samples, but we also want to try to reconstruct local past climates by looking at microfossils and biochemical markers in the sediment cores left by cyannobacteria and other microorganisms. Unfortunately, because the lakes were completely frozen this year due to the high amount of snow, we were not able to take sediment cores from them.\nHow far back in time can lake sediments in Antarctica take you?\nIt depends on the lake. We once collected a sediment core from a lake in the Larsemann Hills near Australia's Davis Station which went back 120,000 years before present. But most lakes in Antarctica are less than 10,000 years old, so only back to the beginning of the early part of the Holocene, the warm interglacial period we are currently living in.\nSince the coast tends to have more exposed bedrock, one would assume that lakes in Antarctica would be close to the coast.\nYes, most lakes are close to the coast. Near the Japanese station and the Russian Novo Station, which are both close to the coast, there are a number of lakes. In the interior of the continent, lakes are rare, because it's too dry. But last year Zorigto discovered some lakes not far from PEA. These are the lakes we planned to core this year.\nWhen you go out in the field, how do you normally travel? By skidoo?\nThis year we've only been travelling by skidoo, unlike previous years, when we were travelling by Prinoth tractor because we needed to visit more remote places. We don't have a lot of material to take with us this year, and we don't have to set up a camp in the field, so we have no need for Prinoths this year. We've been taking day trips by skidoo.\nHow has your experience at the station been so far this year?\nIt's a nice atmosphere. The last time I was here two years ago there was still a lot of construction work going on, and it was a bit hectic. This year, things are a bit more relaxed, although people are still working very hard all the time on other things to make our work possible.\nThe nice thing about being able to do all our research by day trips this season is that we can come back to the station in the evening and have a nice, hot meal! We get first-class treatment at PEA!\nI've been to several stations before, and it's nice to see that everyone at PEA are very supportive of the scientific work we're doing.\nPicture: Elie Verleyen - © International Polar Foundation","Microbial community structure characteristics and its key driving factors in surface sediments along Nanfei River\nYANG Chang-ming1, WU Ya-qiong1, WANG Yu-lai2, GUO Yun-hao1\n1. Key Laboratory of Yangtze Water Environment of Ministry of Education, Tongji University, Shanghai 200092, China;\n2. School of Energy and Environment, Anhui University of Technology, Maanshan 234000, China\nIn order to explore the differences in bacterial community structure and its driving factors in the sediment of Nanfei River, the key physiochemical parameters including pH, CEC, TOC, DOC, and various forms of nitrogen were determined in the surface sediment samples along Nanfei River with different land uses such as urban, suburb, industrial park and rural areas. Specially, sediment bacterial community structure characteristics were analyzed by using MiSeq high-throughput sequencing technology. The relationships between sediment bacterial community structure and aforementioned physiochemical parameters were examined by redundancy analysis (RDA). The results showed that the major bacterial phylum is Proteobacteria in the surface sediments, followed by Chloroflexi, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes. At the level of class, the major bacterial class are Anaerolineae, Gammaproteobacteria, Clostridia, Deltaproteobacteria besides the unclassified. Epsilonproteobacteria were detected mainly in sediment samples from downstream of the Nanfei River, suggesting that they were not ubiquitous in the sediment ecosystem of the Nanfei River. Most of the genus is unclassified, with Longilinea and Bellilinea being predominant species. Different types of land uses along the Nanfei River led to different pollution sources and discharging load will result in different physicochemical properties of surface sediment, which in turn reshape the bacterial community structure of the sediment. The bacterial diversity in the sediments from urban and industrial areas of the middle reaches is generally higher than that in the upper and lower reaches. RDA analysis indicated that the sediment CEC, TOC, DOC, TP, nitrogen in weak acid extractable form (WAEF-N) and nitrogen in ion exchangeable form (IEF-N) were the key factors driving the differences in the structural characteristics of bacterial communities in the sediment of Nanfei River. The influence of TP was significant on Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, and WAEF-N had a greater influence on Chloroflexi.\n杨长明, 吴亚琼, 王育来, 郭韵昊. 南淝河表层沉积物细菌群落结构特征及驱动因素[J]. 中国环境科学, 2018, 38(9): 3552-3561.\nYANG Chang-ming, WU Ya-qiong, WANG Yu-lai, GUO Yun-hao.

{"question":"What are the key production characteristics of Australian wool versus cashmere?","answer":"Australian wool production began with Macarthur's crossbreeding efforts, focusing on producing fine wool equal to Spanish wool quality, which was validated by a Committee of Manufacturers and later earned a gold medal for matching Saxon wool quality. For cashmere, production varies widely depending on breeding progress from feral foundation herds. Initially, selected feral goats produced around 70 grams of cashmere down annually under farmed conditions, but well-bred modern animals can produce over 500 grams.

The animals, the land, the husbandry and the technology are all readily available.\nAfter 25 years of selective breeding, the Australian Cashmere Goat has evolved into a distinctive breed of goat, far removed from its bush goat origins. Whilst retaining the fertility and hardiness of the bush goat, the Australian Cashmere is quite different in appearance and temperament. In mid winter it will have an excellent overall coverage of long dense cashmere. Many of the animals now grow cashmere year round and can be seen with good cashmere growth in Summer. After years of domesticity, farming Australian Cashmeres is not that dissimilar to farming and handling crossbred sheep. The Australian Cashmeres of today are far easier to handle and manage than the bush goats from which they originated.\nWhat is Australian Cashmere?\nCashmere is the fine soft downy winter undercoat found on many goats. This undercoat that grows as the day length shortens and is associated with an outercoat of coarse hair, which is present all the year and is called Guard Hair. Most common goat breeds, including dairy goats, grow this two coated fleece. A goat which grows this fine undercoat of the correct quality and in sufficient quantities to be commercial is called an Australian cashmere goat.\nThe mixture of hair and down is dehaired to produce the final down product, using specialised processing machinery.\nCashmere is one of the finest commercial animal fibres. It is soft, warm, light and luxurious. It is used to make some of the most expensive garments in the world.\nThe name \"cashmere\" is derived from the area Kashmir, near India. The fibre has been traditionally produced in China, Mongolia, Iran, Afghanistan and India. In these countries cashmere fibre is often a secondary consideration to the goats primary function of producing meat and milk.\nWorld Production of cashmere is about 8,000 tonnes annually of hair-in product from which the worlds’ cashmere processors extract around 3,600 tonnes of down. About half of this is produced in China and the Chinese Autonomous Region of Inner Mongolia. Around 850 tonnes of down are produced annually by Iran and Afghanistan and 700 tonnes by the Republic of Mongolia. Australia and New Zealand between them produced just on 45 tonnes of down.\nGoats came to Australia with the First Fleet. It has even been suggested, although there is no documentary evidence, that goats were liberated on the islands off the coast of Australia by Dutch and Portuguese navigators long before the British settlement of Australia. The introduced goats would appear to have come from a great variety of backgrounds and they acclimatised readily to the Australian environment. Most pre- 1830 prints of early Australia show the animals on the hills in the background as goats.\nSome early efforts were made to develop a fleece goat industry in Australia. William Riley, in 1832 imported \"Angora-Cachemire\" animals to increase the quality and quantity of down fibre growing on previously imported goats. In that year he delivered a paper to the Agricultural and Horticultural Society of New South Wales in an effort to encourage the development of a cashmere/angora fleece industry in Australia. It took a further 150 years for Australian graziers to develop some of his concepts. An advertisement also appeared in 1832 in the Western Australia publication \"Colonial Paper\" for young half-bred Cashmere bucks offered for sale at 3 pounds each by W. Tanner of Caversham.\nIt is likely that the gold rush period brought the demise of the infant goat industry. Prior to the gold rush, flocks of grazing animals, goats and sheep were controlled by shepherds. Most abandoned their charges in favour of making their fortune on the gold fields. The landowners then had to make some attempt at fencing their runs. Rudimentary fences could be erected to control sheep, which on large runs without fences would keep to the open plains. The goats were not controlled by fences and actively sought the rougher country as their grazing environment. Thus forming the large herds of wild (or feral) goats that became well established in much of inland Australia. Eventually the spread of settlement pushed these herds back into the semi arid sparsely settled areas of the country.\nOther introductions occurred in Australia in the 1800's. Wilson (1873) records that Dr. Chalmers imported 49 cashmere goats through Melbourne in 1863 from Chinese Tartery. At this time Wilson was running his own flock of Cashmere goats at Longerenong in Western Victoria. These were descendants of one male and two females imported from India.\nThrough the intervening years history records many references to goats in Australia. In 1879 herds of goats roaming the streets of Sydney created such a nuisance that police action was required to get them away. Goat racing in which goats were driven by youths in light gigs became very popular at the end of the century, particularly in Queensland. The famous opera singer, Dame Nellie Melba, was so taken with the spectacle at Rockhampton, Queensland, that she arranged for the running of the Melba Derby.\nCashmere was effectively rediscovered on Australian goats in 1972 when two CSIRO researchers Dr. Ian Smith and Mr. Wal Clarke identified cashmere on some feral goats under inspection at the property of The Australian Mohair Company at Brewarrina. For a number of years the CSIRO maintained a small research herd of selected animals at their Prospect laboratory until budget restraints forced their dispersal. Some important early histological work was carried out during this period.\nBy the late 1970's a number of breeders were toying with the concept of developing and breeding an Australian cashmere goat. Much of this early breeding was hampered by a lack of knowledge of the problems involved and by lack of a market.\nInterest and morale were given a major boost when in August 1980 Dawson International Limited PLC, Scotland; the worlds largest cashmere processors purchased a property at Adelong, N.S.W. with the view to setting up a demonstration farm to encourage Australian cashmere production. The chairman of Dawson International Limited, Sir Alan Smith, saw the world cashmere supply situation tightening. Although cashmere represented only a small percentage of the volume of fibre handled by the company, it accounted for 50% of the turnover and was a major contributor to company profitability.\nAs interest in cashmere production developed, the idea of a producer body to catalyze development and pool knowledge was put forward by those people who had been involved in the CSIRO project. In December 1978, a meeting at Bundanoon, New South Wales, agreed to form a grower group, which they called The Australian Cashmere Goat Society. Geographical isolation caused the formation of a number of other groups. Eventually all amalgamated to form The Australian Cashmere Growers Association.\nThe Australian Cashmere Growers Association is now the grower-owned controlling organisation for the cashmere industry. The ACGA has developed through a number of stages:\nThe early days of the industry were hampered by a lack of market. To stimulate industry development Dawsons offered to purchase all Australian Cashmere and in December 1980 the Victorian Cashmere Group organised the first pool sale to Dawsons of 50kg of cashmere.\nDawsons set up fleece testing facilities at their Adelong property and offered to purchase any growers fleece on the basis of objective measurement. This service operated between May 1981 and March 1986. From January 1983 Filati Biagioli Modesto S.P.A. of Italy also offered a buying service based on AWTA test results.\nThe Australian Cashmere Marketing Corporation (ACMC) was established as the marketing arm of the AGGA. It began life in 1985 as a small lots pool, a service to small growers. In March 1986 it took over the responsibility for classing and selling the entire Australian cashmere clip. Dawson and Biagioli agreed to buy all Australian cashmere through the ACMC and they were joined by a third processor, the Forte Cashmere Company Inc. of USA. Until 2004 the bulk of Australian cashmere has been sold by the ACMC.\nIn 2005 Cashmere Connections started purchased cashmere directly from growers, and like the ACGA accepted all lots. Fibre was also purchased by Belisa Cashmere.\nProduction from Australian Cashmere goats varies widely, depending upon the degree to which stocks have been bred-on from the initial feral foundation herds. Selected feral goats produced around 70 grammes of cashmere down per year under farmed conditions, whilst now, well bred animals can produce in excess of 500 grammes for the better types.\nBreeders should aim at a large framed, upstanding animal, with good constitution, good reproductive ability and a good milk supply. This animal should grow as much cashmere down as possible, with fibre evenly distributed and of similar type. For maximum financial return the fleece should be of a uniform colour and length. Fine white fleece, between 35 and 100 mm, currently attracts the highest price.\nThe characteristics of the animals’ fleece are important. There must be a well defined diameter difference between guard hair and down. This is readily obvious to the eye. Fine guard hair intermingled with coarse down makes the dehairing process very difficult. There are a variety of fibre types that grow in the same diameter range as cashmere. It is important for the breeder to learn to recognise and select for true \"cashmere style\" fibre.\nGuard hair length may vary from short to long and shaggy. Where goats are to be run in scrub paddocks, selection for longer guard hair to protect the cashmere is desirable.\nChoice of foundation animals will depend upon personal preference and availability.\nBred-on animals may be purchased, or you may choose to start from the beginning. Most early breeders started from the feral base. They overcame the problems involved and carried the losses. Nowadays bred-on goats from established breeders will be the most economic starting point.\nOne or more bucks should be purchased or leased. They should be selected with the aim of complementing the chosen females' fleece characteristics.\nOnly bucks with full fleece test results for diameter and down weight should be selected for cashmere production. Note that most animals increase in down fibre diameter with age, in some cases dramatically. Fleece test results should always indicate the age at which the animal was tested, and test results for more than one year should be used, if available\nBeware of comparing test results between herds without assessing the nutritional background of the animals. Extra feed produces extra cashmere! Due to the high sexual activity and strong social codes in the buck mobs, animals generally do better and grow more cashmere in smaller mobs. Allow for this in your assessments.\nRefer to Goat Note E 6 entitled \"Breeding Cashmere in Australian Goats\".\n© 2006 A.C.G.A.

{"question":"What are the key differences between a forward point collar and the classic tie knot in terms of their formal appearance and practical functionality?","answer":"The forward point (or point) collar is distinguished by narrow points that frame a tie and remain visible even under a blazer. It's considered timeless and flattering, working well both with and without a tie. In contrast, the classic tie knot (also called simple knot or regatta knot) is a functional and widely suitable knot style that works with most collar types, particularly Italian or classic necks. However, it's not recommended for cutaway necks with wide openings, which are better suited for bow ties. When tying any knot, it should be adjusted so the tie point reaches just above the belt, with the smaller part tucked away in the pass.","context":["For something as seemingly straightforward as a button-down shirt, the amount of details it’s possible to get hung up on is staggering. There’s the fit, the fabric, the cuffs, and—perhaps most complicated of all—the collars. To the untrained eye, the differences between various styles are subtle, often only distinguishable by millimeters of fabric. But when you’re unwittingly wearing a tab collar without a tie, these distinctions speak volumes.\nTo help decode the difference between a spread and a cutaway, and what styles you really need to have on the ready, we turned to Budd Shirtmakers—a London-based tailor that does exactly what its name suggests: make exquisite shirts, in nearly every style you might imagine. Here, with the help of senior cutter Darren Tiernan and bespoke cutter James Macauslan, we break down the basics.\nIt doesn’t get much more classic than a forward point—which is sometimes also referred to as just a “point collar.” It’s distinguished by points (the tips of the collar) that narrowly frame a tie, fully visible even when you’re wearing a blazer or sport coat. “Budd’s main collar is a [forward point],” explains Tiernan. “It’s timeless, flattering to almost everyone, and works well both with and without a tie.”\nSlightly more modern, both spread and semi-spread collars have points that angle out towards your collarbones, and should tuck just under the lapels of your jacket (the semi-spread is incrementally narrower). “The points are slightly more open than a conservative forward collar,” says Tiernan, “allowing for a fuller tie knot.” That more expressive knot and neat tuck make for the perfect subtle fashion statement, appropriate for even the most conservative of offices.\nWhere the spread is demure, the cutaway is bold. Distinguished by its stiff, short shape, its points angle even further outwards than the spread collar, letting your tie take center stage. The style, which is also sometimes referred to as a Windsor collar, originated in the 1930s as a way to accommodate the wide Windsor tie knots which were coming into style at that time.\nThough many of these styles are British or Italian in origin, the button-down is all American. Developed by Brooks Brothers in the early 21st century (the brand, which is celebrating its 200th anniversary this year, also was the first to make shirts with the collars attached), the points of this collar—which angle closer to those of the forward collar described above—are fastened down to the shirt with buttons, allowing for it to look sharp without feeling overly stiff. “Button-downs are perennial favorites as they sit nicely under a jacket or sweater without a tie,” says Tiernan. He and Macalusan also suggest wearing the style slightly open, for a sexy dose of nonchalance.\nThink of the tab collar, with its long, straight points, as the forward’s dressier cousin. It was one of the very first kinds of collars ever developed, attached to the rest of the shirt with a hidden fabric-covered button. Today, wear it—or the pin collar, which swaps that button for a sleek metal bar—to your next wedding, or with your favorite power suit for that all-important presentation. Be sure to heed Tiernan and Macalusan’s advice and always pair this style with a tie. “The two flaps look untidy and the intent of the shirt is missed entirely [without one].”\nLike the cutaway collar, the penny round (or club) is not for sartorial wallflowers. The style, which features points that are softly rounded off, was developed to distinguish the uniforms worn by boys who attended Eaton from other top schools—and when worn incorrectly can lean overly dandyish. Reserve it for occasions when you want to make a statement, but don’t need to be overly formal—think a cocktail party or more casual wedding—and always be sure to wear a tie.\nThough arguably not as versatile as the styles above, the neckband or grandad collar—which really is a shirt without a collar at all—makes for an easy smart-casual option. “The neckband shirt is a great alternative to [traditional styles],” Tiernan says. That said, he advises paying close attention to the fabric from which your shirt is cut: stick with light linens on vacation, and go for a sturdier twill at the office.\nHave a style question?

The tie can be daunting for beginners looking for their style. However with good advice and modern fabrics, you can wear the tie and update your style. With this tie guide, discover how to wear the tie with simplicity and elegance. Matching your tie will have no more secrets for you!\nThe tie, a matter of materials and colors\nThe tie is an accessory that needs to be adapted to the context. It is also a strong piece that allows you to express your personality. Depending on your mood of the day and the event, you can wear a rather classic tie or more original.\nTo choose the tie that will perfectly complement your outfit, you can play on the material, color or shape of the tie knot.\nIn terms of materials, synthetic fabrics are to be avoided altogether because synthetic fabrics age badly and may have a quite shiny appearance that is not very elegant. A tie with a beautiful material can be in silk, wool or cotton.\nWool is an interesting material that stands out from traditional silk ties. Contrary to popular belief, the woolen tie is not hot, because it is a natural material with good thermoregulatory properties. The cotton knit brings a modern-retro side especially in preppy styles for example.\nAll the interest of the color of a tie is to contrast with the shirt. This touch of color that contrasts with the rest allows you to create a point of visual interest and therefore a look that is out of the ordinary.\nFor reasons, it is easier to handle the geometric patterns very simple and preferably small. Rather than a plain tie, try a faux-uni or a textured material that will be much more pretty to the eye.\nTie your neck tie with simplicity and elegance\nA beautiful tie is also a beautiful knot. However no need to learn ten whimsical knots, the simple knot or regatta knot is a beautiful functional knot that suits most men.\nThe collar of the shirt must also be adapted to the size of the knot of the tie, the Italian or classic necks are very suitable in contrast to the cutaway necks with wide opening which are reserved for wearing a bow tie. To tie the tie you must first close all the buttons and pull up the collar, then tie the knot and tighten it high enough so that the last button of the shirt is no longer visible.\nAt the level of the length, it is necessary to adjust the tie so that the point of the belt arrives just above the belt and never below. The little part of the tie should not be visible, so you have to slip it in the pass so that it does not appear when the tie moves.\nAfter a day of wearing a tie, always think about undoing the knot of the tie so that the material of the tie will return to its original shape.

{"question":"When comparing early intervention strategies for mental decline, how do the benefits of regular physical exercise differ from waiting for cognitive symptoms to appear?","answer":"Regular physical exercise as an early intervention strategy offers several advantages over waiting for cognitive symptoms to appear. Exercise can help shield against depressive episodes and protect against age-related brain decline with as little as one hour per week of activity. When cognitive symptoms appear later, they often indicate dementia has already begun affecting daily activities and mental functions. While early diagnosis of dementia allows maximum benefit from available treatments, these treatments typically only temporarily improve symptoms and cannot stop progression. In contrast, preventive exercise, especially aerobic workouts, can strengthen brain connectivity, increase hippocampus size, and provide immediate benefits like improved mood and reduced stress hormones, potentially preventing or delaying cognitive decline before it becomes severe.","context":["|Dementia is a general term for a decline in mental ability severe enough to interfere with daily life. Memory loss is an example. Alzheimer's is the most common type of dementia.|\nFind out what how typical age-related memory loss compares to early signs of Alzheimer's and other dementias.\nLearn the signs.\nDementia is not a specific disease. It's an overall term that describes a wide range of symptoms associated with a decline in memory or other thinking skills severe enough to reduce a person's ability to perform everyday activities. Alzheimer's disease accounts for 60 to 80 percent of cases. Vascular dementia, which occurs after a stroke, is the second most common dementia type. But there are many other conditions that can cause symptoms of dementia, including some that are reversible, such as thyroid problems and vitamin deficiencies.\nDementia is often incorrectly referred to as \"senility\" or \"senile dementia,\" which reflects the formerly widespread but incorrect belief that serious mental decline is a normal part of aging.\nWhile symptoms of dementia can vary greatly, at least two of the following core mental functions must be significantly impaired to be considered dementia:\nPeople with dementia may have problems with short-term memory, keeping track of a purse or wallet, paying bills, planning and preparing meals, remembering appointments or traveling out of the neighborhood.\nMany dementias are progressive, meaning symptoms start out slowly and gradually get worse. If you or a loved one is experiencing memory difficulties or other changes in thinking skills, don't ignore them. See a doctor soon to determine the cause. Professional evaluation may detect a treatable condition. And even if symptoms suggest dementia, early diagnosis allows a person to get the maximum benefit from available treatments and provides an opportunity to volunteer for clinical trials or studies. It also provides time to plan for the future.\nSign up for our weekly e-newsletter\nReceive helpful tips on managing symptoms of Alzheimer's disease and dementia. Subscribe now\nDifferent types of dementia are associated with particular types of brain cell damage in particular regions of the brain. For example, in Alzheimer's disease, high levels of certain proteins inside and outside brain cells make it hard for brain cells to stay healthy and to communicate with each other. The brain region called the hippocampus is the center of learning and memory in the brain, and the brain cells in this region are often the first to be damaged. That's why memory loss is often one of the earliest symptoms of Alzheimer's.\nWhile most changes in the brain that cause dementia are permanent and worsen over time, thinking and memory problems caused by the following conditions may improve when the condition is treated or addressed:\nThere is no one test to determine if someone has dementia. Doctors diagnose Alzheimer's and other types of dementia based on a careful medical history, a physical examination, laboratory tests, and the characteristic changes in thinking, day-to-day function and behavior associated with each type. Doctors can determine that a person has dementia with a high level of certainty. But it's harder to determine the exact type of dementia because the symptoms and brain changes of different dementias can overlap. In some cases, a doctor may diagnose \"dementia\" and not specify a type. If this occurs it may be necessary to see a specialist such as a neurologist or gero-psychologist.\nLearn more: Memory Tests\nTreatment of dementia depends on its cause. In the case of most progressive dementias, including Alzheimer's disease, there is no cure and no treatment that slows or stops its progression. But there are drug treatments that may temporarily improve symptoms. The same medications used to treat Alzheimer's are among the drugs sometimes prescribed to help with symptoms of other types of dementias. Non-drug therapies can also alleviate some symptoms of dementia.\nUltimately, the path to effective new treatments for dementia is through increased research funding and increased participation in clinical studies. Right now, volunteers are urgently needed to participate in more than 180+ actively enrolling clinical studies and trials about Alzheimer's and related dementias.\nSome risk factors for dementia, such as age and genetics, cannot be changed. But researchers continue to explore the impact of other risk factors on brain health and prevention of dementia. Some of the most active areas of research in risk reduction and prevention include cardiovascular factors, physical fitness, and diet.\nCardiovascular risk factors: Your brain is nourished by one of your body's richest networks of blood vessels. Anything that damages blood vessels anywhere in your body can damage blood vessels in your brain, depriving brain cells of vital food and oxygen. Blood vessel changes in the brain are linked to vascular dementia. They often are present along with changes caused by other types of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. These changes may interact to cause faster decline or make impairments more severe. You can help protect your brain with some of the same strategies that protect your heart – don't smoke; take steps to keep your blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar within recommended limits; and maintain a healthy weight.\nPhysical exercise: Regular physical exercise may help lower the risk of some types of dementia. Evidence suggests exercise may directly benefit brain cells by increasing blood and oxygen flow to the brain.\nDiet: What you eat may have its greatest impact on brain health through its effect on heart health. The best current evidence suggests that heart-healthy eating patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet, also may help protect the brain. A Mediterranean diet includes relatively little red meat and emphasizes whole grains, fruits and vegetables, fish and shellfish, and nuts, olive oil and other healthy fats.\nLearn more: Brain Health","Want an all-natural way to lift your mood, improve your memory, and protect your brain against age-related cognitive decline?\nThe Benefits of Exercise, Especially Aerobic Workouts\nA wealth of recent research, including a new study published this month, suggests that any type of exercise that raises your heart rate and gets you moving and sweating for a sustained period of time is good for you. This type of exercise, known as aerobic exercise, has a significant and beneficial impact on the brain.\n“Aerobic exercise is the key for your head, just as it is for your heart,” said an article in the Harvard Medical School blog “Mind and Mood. Most research suggests that the best type of aerobic exercise for your mind is anything you can do regularly and consistently for 30-45 minutes at a time. Yet, the latest study suggests that anykind of workout is the best workout. Whether it’s a 5 minute or 45 minute session, exercise can have beneficial impacts on mental health.\nExercise Positively Affects Depression\nThe new study, published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, is the largest long-term study of its kind to look at the link between exercise and mental health, with a special focus on depression.\nThe researchers studied close to 34,000 Norwegian adults over 11 years. Respondents reported how often they exercised each week, how intense it was, and how depressed or anxious they felt. The results suggested that as little as one hour of exercise each week helped shield people against depressive episodes. Notably, that exercise did not need to be aerobic. Participants who got moving without becoming breathless (perhaps with an activity like a long, moderately-paced walk) were significantly less likely to report symptoms of depression compared with those who did no exercise.\nPlenty of other research has revealed a powerful connection between mental and physical fitness across varying levels of intensity. Some benefits — like a lift in mood — can emerge as soon as a few minutes into a sweaty endeavor. Other benefits — like improved memory — might take several weeks to crop up.\nA pilot study in people with severe depression, for example, found that just 30 minutes of treadmill walking for 10 consecutive days was “sufficient to produce a clinically relevant and statistically significant reduction in depression.” Aerobic workouts appear to help reduce levels of the body’s natural stress hormones, such as adrenaline and cortisol, according to a recent study in the Journal of Physical Therapy Science.\nProtecting Against Age-Related Brain Decline\nIn older people, the best way to protect against age-related brain decline seems to be aerobic workouts. A study published in May found that in adults aged 60-88, walking for 30 minutes four days a week for 12 weeks appeared to strengthen connectivity in a region of the brain where weakened connections have been linked with memory loss. And a study in older women who displayed symptoms of dementia found that sweaty, heart-pumping exercise was linked with an increase in the size of the hippocampus, a brain area involved in learning and memory.\nSeveral studies even suggest that aerobic workouts provide the best protection against other types of cognitive decline, too. A study involving hundreds of breast cancer survivors concluded that such exercise seemed to reduce the symptoms of “chemo brain,” a commonly reported side effect of cancer treatment that involves memory loss and difficulty focusing.\n“The message for cancer patients and survivors is, get active!” Diane Ehlers, the lead author of that study and a professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, said in a statement.\nThe best overall health results — mental and physical — for people over 50 appear to come from a combination of aerobic workouts and resistance training (strengthening work like weights or squats). That type of workout plan could be anything from high-intensity interval training, like the 7-minute workout, to dynamic flow yoga, which intersperses strength-building poses with heart-pumping dance-like moves.\nResearchers still aren’t sure why exercise appears to provide so many benefits to our brain and body. One factor could be increased blood flow, since aerobic work pumps fresh energy and oxygen to the brain.\nRegardless of the cause, Joe Northey, an exercise scientist at the University of Canberra, said his research suggests that anyone in good health over age 50 should do 45 minutes to an hour of aerobic exercise “on as many days of the week as feasible.”\nThat’s probably good advice for all ages."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:dbc37864-3b9c-49cd-9645-ef23ac54e994>","<urn:uuid:6d267815-de26-423b-b983-1e2e32701b99>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the financial implications of maritime fuel infrastructure development, and what technical innovations are enabling the transition to cleaner fuels?","answer":"The financial implications include a required investment of USD 1-1.4 trillion by 2050, with 87% needed for land-based infrastructure including hydrogen production, ammonia synthesis, and storage facilities. Complete decarbonization would require an additional USD 400 billion. On the technical innovation side, researchers are using advanced computational resources to develop modified combustion engines that can handle carbon-free fuels. A key breakthrough involves utilizing ships' waste heat to decompose ammonia onboard, creating a fuel mixture with properties similar to natural gas. This innovation both improves efficiency through waste heat recycling and enables the use of existing engine infrastructure, though significant research continues to optimize combustion and reduce emissions.","context":["The scale of investment needed to decarbonize international shipping\nTo make the decarbonization of the maritime shipping sector successful, the coming three decades will need to see a fundamental shift towards zero carbon energy sources. This implies a need for significant investments into new fuel production, supply chains, and a new or retrofitted fleet.\n- Randall Krantz\n- Senior Project Advisor, Global Maritime Forum\n- Kasper Søgaard\n- Head of Research, Global Maritime Forum\n- Dr Tristan Smith\n- Reader in Energy and Shipping, University College London\n\"The scale of cumulative investment needed between 2030 and 2050 to achieve the IMO target ... is approximately USD 1-1.4 trillion.\"\nJanuary 20 2020\nThe aim of this insight brief is to gauge the capital investment needed to achieve decarbonization outcomes in line with the IMO Initial Strategy. This Insight Brief is based on new analytical work conducted by University Maritime Advisory Services (UMAS) and Energy Transitions Commission (ETC)¹.\nAt least USD 1 trillion in investments needed to decarbonize shipping\nThe scale of cumulative investment needed between 2030 and 2050 to achieve the IMO target of reducing carbon emissions from shipping by at least 50% by 2050, is approximately USD 1-1.4 trillion, or on average between USD 50- 70 billion annually for 20 years. This estimate should be seen in the context of annual global investments in energy, which in 2018 amounted to USD 1.85 trillion.\nIf shipping was to fully decarbonize by 2050, this would require extra investments of approximately USD 400 billion over 20 years, making the total investments needed between USD 1.4-1.9 trillion dollars.\nThe estimate of investments required is based on ammonia (NH3) being the primary zero carbon fuel choice adopted by the shipping industry as it moves towards zero carbon fuels². Under different assumptions, hydrogen, synthetic methanol, or other fuels may displace ammonia’s projected dominance, but the magnitude of investments needed will not significantly change for these other fuels.\nTo avoid shifting emissions upstream, it is important that efforts to decarbonize shipping also include the decarbonization of fuel production. The analysis is therefore based on the use of low/zero carbon hydrogen as input to the production of ammonia.\nFigure 1 shows the modelled capital investment needed for two different overall rates of decarbonization – a 50% GHG reduction by 2050 on the way to 100% by 2070, as per the IMO mandate, and a 100% GHG reduction by 2050, as per a 1.5°C scenario.\nFigure 1: Total investments needed to achieve IMO decarbonization targets and investments needed to fully decarbonize shipping by 2050\nThe investments needed depend on the production method for the hydrogen used to produce ammonia. The figure shows the total investment in infrastructure needed for three different methods of hydrogen production: pure electrolysis production, production based on pure steam methane reformation (SMR) with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS), and a mix between the two.\nThe investment to produce hydrogen from natural gas with carbon capture and sequestration is estimated to be lower than production of hydrogen from electrolysis. However, it cannot from this be concluded that hydrogen from SMR+CCS will be cheaper than hydrogen from renewable electricity, as this will also depend on the price of the energy feedstock.\nThe major need for investment is upstream in energy and fuel production\nInvestment needs can be broken down into two main areas: Ship related investments, which include engines, on-board storage and ship- based energy efficiency technologies, and land-based investments, which include investments in hydrogen production, ammonia synthesis and the land based storage and bunkering infrastructure.\nFigure 2: Investment breakdown across vessels and land-based infrastructure\nThe biggest share of investments is needed in the land-based infrastructure and production facilities for low carbon fuels, which make up around 87% of the total investment³. Hydrogen production make up around half of the total land-based investments needed, while ammonia synthesis and storage and bunkering infrastructure make up the other half.\nOnly 13 % of the investments needed are related to the ships themselves. These investments include the machinery and onboard storage required for a ship to run on ammonia both in newbuild ships and, in some cases, for retrofits. Shiprelated investments also include investments in improving energy efficiency, which are estimated to be higher due to the higher fuel costs of ammonia compared to traditional marine fuels.\nGreen and blue hydrogen potential feedstocks for zero carbon ammonia\nA major component of the investments is related to the production of low/zero carbon hydrogen, which can either be produced from natural gas using steam methane reformation (SMR) combined with carbon capture and storage (blue hydrogen) or from renewable electricity and water through electrolysis (green hydrogen).\nThe relative competitiveness of the two options is a function of the investment costs and the prices of electricity and natural gas and will be significantly influenced by technology development and policy choice. In the medium- to long-term, the rapidly falling price of renewable electricity and a reduction in electrolyser costs are expected by some to make electrolysers the lower cost production solution in many geographies – even if electrolysers are a more expensive option in capital cost terms.\nMeanwhile, costs of CCS are also expected to decrease as technologies move beyond pilots and demonstrations. Acceleration of cost reductions for CCS would allow for a competitive marketplace between green and blue hydrogen, likely influenced by contextual geography and policy.\nFigure 3: Zero carbon ammonia production chain\nSynthesis and conclusions\nWhilst research and development is valuable across all technology areas pertinent to shipping’s decarbonization, the opportunity to reduce the overall costs of decarbonization is greatest in the upstream production of fuels. This emphasizes the need to involve stakeholders across the full fuel value chain to make the transition possible in the most economically efficient manner.\nHydrogen and ammonia have multiple applications in today’s economy and likely increasing roles in the global economy across energy storage, low carbon heat, transport fuels and, in the case of ammonia, as a key input in the production of fertilizer. This means that investments in hydrogen and ammonia production can serve other purposes than supplying fuels for shipping, which can create synergies and reduce the investment risk, especially in the early phase of the transition.\nFinally, it is important to note that the significant investments needed to decarbonize shipping can only be expected to happen if there is a long term commercially viable business case. Technological developments alone – although very important – are not expected to be enough to create such a business case as the costs of zero emissions fuels are expected to be significantly higher than traditional fossil fuels used in shipping in the coming decades.\nThe analysis uses the GloTraM model to estimate the profit maximising solutions (combination of decarbonisation choices), given a number of different fuel and machinery options. Some cost reductions over time are incorporated into the projections, but all estimates are uncertain and should be used as a guide to the scale only, due to the rapidly evolving nature of underlying technologies.\n² Ammonia (NH3) is primarily produced through a chemical process where hydrogen reacts with nitrogen taken from the air to form ammonia. The competitiveness of ammonia in the model stems from the fact that ammonia is cheaper and easier to store (both onshore and onboard) than hydrogen and cheaper to produce than synthetic hydrocarbons such as methanol.\n³ This breakdown is based on the scenario where shipping achieves a 50% reduction in GHG emissions by 2050 using a combination of SMR+CCS and electrolysis to produce zero carbon hydrogen. The other scenarios show a similar but not identical distribution of costs.\nThis Insight Brief is based on analysis by UMAS and the Energy Transitions Commission for the Getting to Zero Coalition, a partnership between the Global Maritime Forum, the Friends of Ocean Action, and the World Economic Forum.\nThe Getting to Zero Coalition is an industry-led platform for collaboration that brings together leading stakeholders from across the maritime and fuels value chains with the financial sector and other committed to making commercially viable zero emission vessels a scalable reality by 2030.\nThe views expressed in this Insight Brief are those of the authors alone and not the Getting to Zero Coalition or the Global Maritime Forum, Friends of Ocean Action or the World Economic Forum.","Traditionally, these ships’ internal combustion engines have run on the cheapest fossil fuels. Typically bunker oil, which produces large emissions of both climate and air-polluting gases. The shipping industry wants climate-friendly solutions, but since technology based on batteries or fuel cells is neither technically mature nor competitive in price for long distances, this is not presently an option for the shipping industry.\nModified combustion engines\nA climate-friendly solution introduced in the shipping industry is to modify traditional internal combustion engines to burn carbon-free fuels to replace fossil fuels. This means engines that can run on both ammonia, natural gas, or on conventional spare fuel such as diesel when needed. However, significant research efforts are required to enable the same engine to burn different types of fuel while providing high efficiency, safety, and low emissions.\nOptimization of combustion also requires a knowledge-based approach and a detailed understanding of the basic properties of the physical processes that happen in the internal combustion engines. This is what Andrea Gruber and fellow researchers at SINTEF and NTNU are investigating in more detail now.\nUnparalleled computational resources\nThe team of researchers has conducted direct numerical simulation (DNS) to study processes in the internal combustion engine, utilizing Norway's most powerful and latest HPC system Betzy. They did this by using a conventional gas fuel such as gaseous methane (CH4), or carbon-free hydrogen (H2), or a mixture of ammonia and hydrogen (NH3 / H2).\nDNS usually runs as massively parallel calculations using thousands of arithmetic nodes and tens of thousands of processor cores. Carrying out the simulations, the researchers have used computational resources of an order of magnitude unparalleled in a Norwegian context. With a standard laptop, it would take 1,168 years to perform the simulations. On Betzy, such a job takes 10 days if you use the whole machine.\nUtilizing waste heat to decompose ammonia on board\nThe calculations make it possible to simulate virtual flames in a small but representative part of a combustion chamber. Research shows that under normal operating conditions, hydrogen has too high a reactivity as a fuel and a tendency to ignite prematurely, while ammonia ignites and burns poorly. None of the fuels is therefore favourable for the internal combustion engines. However, by utilizing waste heat from the ship's engine, ammonia can be partially decomposed on board. Then we get a fuel mixture of ammonia, hydrogen, and nitrogen. A process like this is convenient for two reasons.\nFirstly, the engine's waste heat is recycled to increase the energy content of the fuel. This means that the overall efficiency is improved. Secondly, the combustion properties of the new NH3 / H2 / N2 fuel mixture (ammonia/hydrogen/nitrogen) will be alike what can be characterized as standard natural gas. This is important because it entails that the engines in the current fleet should be able to combust the fuel mixture.\nA comprehensive and detailed analysis of the large DNS datasets from the calculations on Betzy is now underway. Strategies are specifically considered to reduce the formation of air pollutants (NOx) and greenhouse gases (N2O) from the combustion process.\nRead more about the research in the article Ammonia – the key to making long-haul shipping green, in Norwegian SciTech News."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d8f677e2-e1e4-482c-b260-29817e7217ce>","<urn:uuid:8dd3d5d8-a5b7-476f-a3cd-c8f7d8eceeff>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What role do innovative design processes play in both agricultural modernization and competitive sports equipment, and how do these processes reflect adaptation to changing needs?","answer":"In both domains, innovative design processes are driven by the need to adapt to changing circumstances. In vertical farming, designs focus on creating multilayer indoor systems that respond to shrinking arable land and growing food insecurity. These systems are developed through careful integration of technology, including automated sensors and crop simulation models. Similarly, in competitive gymnastics, leotard designs undergo a 5-6 month development process involving multiple stakeholders, from initial concept to final product, with careful attention to both functionality and aesthetics. Both fields demonstrate how design processes must balance practical requirements with innovation - vertical farming must optimize space and resource usage while maintaining crop yields, while gymnastics uniforms must combine comfort, moveability, and visual appeal under arena lights. Both also show how designs evolve to meet new challenges, whether environmental pressures in agriculture or changing aesthetic preferences in sports.","context":["The bright lights beam down from the rafters of Lloyd Noble Center, reflecting off the sparkling logo adorning the front of the Oklahoma gymnast. Light refracts back into the arena, bouncing off these rhinestones as she and her Sooner teammates compete in front of their home crowd.\nJust as the Sooners dazzle and captivate fans with their athletic talents, so do their leotards in catching the eyes of those in the stands. Gymnastics fans have seen these OU leotards over the years, often praising the unique and stunning designs.\nBut just how do these signature Sooner uniforms come into existence?\nIt all starts with head coach K.J. Kindler, who begins the design process “with a little help from famous people.” The Sooners then work with GK Elite Sportswear to design and produce their garments.\nInspiration and design ideas are sparked from different places for Kindler, including a magazine, a costume worn on stage by a singer or a celebrity’s beautiful red carpet gown. Oklahoma aims to be innovative in many facets of the sport of gymnastics, whether that’s through choreography or combinations on events, and the uniforms are no exception.\n“Our goal is to stand out and to have something that’s unique and different and that makes us special,” Kindler states. “We try to take a unique spin on what we’re doing every year and really try to do something different that people haven’t seen before because a leotard obviously has been around a very long time and so in order for us to look different, we really just try to go a different direction than most people have.”\nWhen it comes to the design of OU’s leotards, there are some elements that can be spotted on each look. The Sooners’ uniforms always feature three-quarter length sleeves, the school’s branding and colors – and plenty of sparkle, of course.\nThe Sooners in the leotards they wore as they secured their first-ever NCAA Championship in 2014.\nThe Sooners obviously utilize Crimson and Cream in their leotards but also incorporate nude, black accents and sometimes silver and white. Fans can always see “Oklahoma” or “OU” or “Sooners” somewhere on the front, back and probably the sleeve of each leo. Usually, Lycra, an elastic fabric, is the material used to create the leos, and Kindler likes to incorporate mesh into the designs.\n“I like to use mesh in the upper part of the body. I think it’s more comfortable and they can move around better in it. Believe it or not, I do take comfort into a small account when making these leotards,” Kindler says with a laugh. “Because if it’s tragically uncomfortable, they won’t want to wear it no matter how beautiful it is.”\nWhen creating leotards each season, Kindler and the GK crew focus not just on the front design but also utilize the back of each garment since fans see every side of a gymnast while they are competing.\n“A lot of times the celebrities you see the front of their gowns as they walk in, but you’re seeing a full 360 of a gymnast,” Kindler says. “We really try to take it to another level in the back and we’ve done open backs, we’ve done crisscross backs, and then we just fully bling out in the back as much as we do in the front.”\nAnd the Sooners definitely know how to use the bling. GK utilizes Swarovski crystals on its leotards, and Kindler likes to use a lot of rhinestones to make the designs stand out and sparkle under the lights.\n“I do not know the exact amount (of jewels on each leotard),” says Calli Campo, a GK Business Development Specialist for the Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas and Kansas area. “All that KJ tells me is the more the better!”\nSeveral people have a hand in the leotard creation process, including Campo, who works directly with Kindler from the beginning stages.\nThe pair sits down during the summer and start to discuss ideas for the upcoming season, often texting each other pictures when they spot a costume or dress they like on the Oscars or another show. When there is inspiration they both like, then the discussion about how to apply the look to a leotard begins until it eventually transforms into a sample product.\n“I usually see something that I think is captivating and really interesting and then I tailor it to a leotard,” Kindler explains. “Obviously an evening gown goes all the way to the ground, so you have to make some changes and alterations to what you’re going to do.\nAfter Kindler and Campo find an inspiration, they send the idea onto those at the GK factory in Reading, Penn. There, these ideas become a reality.\n\"I feel like when we finish it’s not just a design, it’s kind of like an art piece that we’ve done.\"\n— Calli Camp, GK\n“They (the company) then makes a virtual design of that leotard and I then make changes to their virtual design until we come up with an idea that we think is great,” Kindler states. “Then they make a sample. When they send a sample, we try it on the athletes so we are able to see where everything hits and lands on the body. Then we make alterations to that then finally there’s your final product.”\nGenerally, the entire process for designing a leotard takes five to six months. For this season, Kindler, Campo and others at GK began the design process in July and finished up in December, creating four new looks thus far with one more to go.\nMany departments and people at GK play a part in the creation of these “beautiful garments”, explains Curry Ridings, a pattern maker for the company. These groups who help make the garments come to life include the sewing department, glue and zig zag, cutters, bundlers and inspectors. The GK designers and pattern makers constantly communicate with each other during the process, testing fabrics and making sure the design in no way will compromise fit and will be able to be sewn without the crystals or other elements getting in the way of the construction.\n“University of Oklahoma designs are all so beautiful and packed with jewels and if the design is beautiful, then it’s our job as pattern makers to make the leo look like the design and at the same time fit perfectly so the gymnasts look beautiful and they are not in any way constrained by the garment so they can do their job the best, looking the best,” says GK’s Anetta Pluto-Jakowczyk. “As a pattern maker, when I see beautiful design packed with jewels and unique, it makes my job more pleasurable I would say.”\nInspiration for leotard designs truly comes from a variety of outlets for Kindler. Some of the initial ideas for the 2016 looks came from a swimsuit and an evening gown.\n“K.J. has a really good eye for design and by that I mean she can look at an ice skating outfit or a gown that a celebrity is wearing and really kind of visualize it and put it in her way of doing it to make it into a leotard,” Campo says. “She’ll even send me drawings … She will kind of draw it up and do arrows, ‘I want this here, this here, this here.’ It’s unique in its way that it’s so intricate and she really focuses on the details when it comes to her leotards.”\nA recent notable leotard is the one the Sooners wore in the 2016 Super Six when they soared to their second NCAA Championship. That design, referred to as the “Armour leo,” began as a swimsuit Kindler spotted in a high-end magazine as she was sitting under the dryer at her hairdresser’s. She took a picture of the swimsuit on her phone because she thought it was amazing, and the process began from there.\n“What we used for rhinestones, they were gold studs on the swimsuit,” Kindler shares. “They had an open cutout, which I meshed the back of it. They couldn’t see the back of this swimsuit, so I had to make up the back, how I thought it should look because the picture was front only. So we worked on the back a lot, got a couple samples of it in. I liked a lot of it right off the bat.\n“But it was where do you put the Sooners? Where do you put the OU? Where do you want to brand this leotard? So we went through that part as well but I thought it was just really beautiful,” Kindler continues. “And I love the designs you can make with rhinestones alone without changing material. There’s just a lot of things you can do with that. So we definitely did the design through the rhinestones on that leo.”\nAnother leotard worn by the Sooners in 2016 was a design featuring black ombre sleeves. OU donned it when they won their fifth straight Big 12 Championship, and it can also be seen on the Sooners in the smoke photos from this season’s photoshoot. This look began with a picture of the crisscross back of a dress that former Sooner Maile’ana Kanewa sent to Kindler. Since they just had a picture of the back, they made up what they thought the front would look like.\n“We had to make it so it could fit on a leotard, which is difficult sometimes,” Kindler explains. “You have to make sure the sides come in a little bit and they don’t go too far off to the seam and you have to make sure the crisscross it can actually work because working with Lycra is not the same as working with other materials. I give full credit to the leotard company for figuring all that out and making it work when you put it on the body.”\nTHE FINISHED PRODUCT\nOklahoma’s leotards stand out year after year, as fans look forward to seeing what the Sooners have in store each season. Just as fans enjoy seeing the new designs, those at GK appreciate the opportunity to help bring the new leotards to fruition.\n“Even though we make leotards every day, and for all different customers, when we see Oklahoma, we basically fight to get the quote because it’s just challenging,” shares GK designer Rosanna Venditti. “Every leo is unique and because it’s a new experience and it challenges us as designers because it’s a new construction, a new way to do jewels or a new pattern, it’s just unique from start to finish and we’re proud to be part of GK and a force that makes their leotards.”\nWhat’s in store for this upcoming season? Inspiration came from the likes of Beyoncé, Jennifer Lopez, Demi Lovato and Oklahoma’s own Carrie Underwood. The Sooners will wear five new leos, with four inspired by the women mentioned above and one still to be designed for the postseason.\n\"We used a jersey-like picture of Beyonce in a leotard and one of our leos looks like similar to a jersey but a little blingier.\" - K.J. Kindler\n\"There's the Carrie Underwood. She wore a costume in one of her shows. It was black and very detailed and so we used that as the inspiration for one of our leos.\" - K.J. Kindler\n\"This was an amazing dress that was sublimated, and I actually mimicked the sublimating on her dress and on the top portion on the top of the leotard. That’s an open back leo, so we are excited about that, but we can’t wear those for postseason (because of having to pin on a number) so that’s probably one that you’ll see during the year.\" - K.J. Kindler\n\"Then for one of them I used a JLo costume that she wore, and she’s very eccentric as you know, and I put material where there was none in the costume. But it turned out really great. I really love the way it looks on them and it’s very unique. I haven’t seen anything quite like it. So that’s really cool.\" - K.J. Kindler\n“I think a lot of the really entertaining women, the women who do pay attention to their costume and do pay attention to their craft are often the ones who are designing really creative things,” Kindler explains. “And so I am drawn to those people and what they can do with their imagination and it just helps kind of spark me.”\nFans attending Friday night’s season opener against No. 3 Alabama will get the first peak at a brand-new garment, the one inspired by a picture of Beyoncé wearing a jersey-like leotard.\n“I feel like when we finish it’s not just a design, it’s kind of like an art piece that we’ve done,” Campo states. “It just takes a long process and when we get to the finish then you just kind of feel excited that this is what we came up with and this is what came to life.”\nAn art piece perfected through months of work, becoming motion under the bright lights.","Agricultural systems around the world need to adapt to the rapidly changing environmental, demographic, and socioeconomic landscapes, and new alternative practices, such as vertical agriculture, may offer new opportunities to accelerate such adaptation.\nNext Gen Farming Without Soil and 90% Less Water | GRATEFUL\nWhat is vertical farming and why is it important\nModern agricultural systems encompass an estimated 1.5 billion hectares of the world’s surface area. With a growing population and resource needs, the availability of arable land is shrinking rapidly.\nSince the agricultural revolution, conventional agriculture has focused on practices requiring considerable quantities of space, water, fertilizer, and pesticides. The past 50 years have seen an accelerating rate of increase in these requirements as modern food production aims to increase productivity in the hopes of addressing growing food insecurity.\nLooking into the future, yield production is forecasted to decrease due to widespread environmental and socioeconomic changes that will generate unpredictable consequences on food systems.\nIn response, many strategies have been developed as alternatives to conventional agricultural practices. These strategies have focused on key principles and their combination to be effective: require less space, less water, and increase yield per unit of area. Moreover, due to the negative effects of agrichemicals, modern practices have also aimed to use significantly less to avoid potentially adverse effects for humans and animals.\nOne such alternative is the development of vertical agriculture, also referred to as vertical farming. As the name implies, vertical agriculture relies on expanding production vertically and not horizontally. Vertical agriculture is a multilayer indoor plant production system that allows for precise control of growth factors, such as light, temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide concentration, water, and nutrients.\nThis allows for the growing and production of crops year-round, completely independent of solar light and other external conditions. Indeed, vertical agriculture makes use of key concepts within ecology and physiology to optimize growing and fertilization within controlled conditions. For instance, elements of photobiology, thermomorphogenesis, hydroponics, and genetic breeding, are all used commonly across systems of vertical agriculture.\nBenefits, challenges, and disadvantages moving from horizontal to vertical farming\nAs a result of tight control over crop breeding, growing, and harvesting, vertical farming provides several benefits relative to conventional methods of ‘horizontal’ food production. This was the topic of a literature review by Kalantari et al. published in 2016 in the Journal of Landscape Ecology.\nFrom a systems perspective, the enclosed design prevents pests and diseases from entering by the adoption of a high level of hygiene, continuous monitoring, and non-chemical disinfection, providing security from crops. Moreover, recent technology has also allowed for automated control over environmental conditions by using sensors and imaging techniques in combination with crop simulation models and artificial intelligence, limiting the need for physical labor.\nVertical farming also allows for flexible organization, with designs ranging from large vertical walls covered with crops to large hangars or re-used shipping containers that can be transported. Consequently, vertical agricultural systems, can comprise many varying sizes and be located within many different areas from the middle of highly urbanized cities to more suburban or rural areas.\nMoreover, the verticality element of this system also provides nutrient and water flow, helping to reuse costly resources. The reduction in space also means there is a significant increase in yield per area, holding extensive potential for a future world of urbanization.\nFrom an economic perspective, vertical farming also provides for more jobs in localized areas and is community-focused by addressing the needs of immediate areas, which in turn can provide food at a lower price. Finally, the optionality of location for vertical systems also allows producers to reduce transport costs, as consumers may access them within urban areas, or transport can be minimized to nearby areas.\nHowever, despite the design, environmental, and economic advantages, vertical farming also incorporates several issues that remain a challenge to its broader implementation as a system.\nVertical farming has a high energy requirement and needs extensive investment costs to implement and develop successfully. Moreover, indoor issues relating to excessive UV, heat, and ozone-induced plant damage may have unpredictable repercussions for plant growth.\nAdditionally, vertical systems are difficult to adapt to a larger scale. They are costly to build and maintain and have yet to demonstrate the ability to provide food for larger areas than community-scale populations. This would make it difficult to implement in areas at higher risk of food insecurity, such as developing agricultural nations.\nThe lack of empirical research on a broader scale has meant that vertical farming has yet to develop past the concept stage on community levels, as persistent issues make it difficult to break through to a larger scale.\nImage Credit: YEINISM/Shutterstock.com\nGrowing skywards - the implications of vertical farming in a rapidly populating and changing world\nAmong the development of alternative agricultural practices, vertical agriculture provides a promising solution for many of the challenges facing current agricultural policies. However, for vertical systems to be integrated on a larger scale requires further technological progress and economic investment.\nNevertheless, gradually implementing more verticality, or combining it with other practices aiming for more sustainable practices may be promising. For instance, the combination of verticality with other practices such as intercropping may be particularly beneficial for developing more sustainable food systems.\nIncorporating technological progress into vertical systems also holds promise, with automated sensors and machinery able to operate near-independently. Progress in gene editing and plant genome modifications will also allow for faster, bigger, and healthier crops, allowing vertical agriculture to produce more over time.\nThroughout agricultural history, farming systems have typically spread over large spans of land, yet the reduction in arable land, as well as the increase in demand to house growing populations, means that such strategies need to be reconsidered, and vertical agriculture may play a role looking into the future.\nContinue Reading: Benefits of Vertical Agriculture and Hydroponics\n- Beacham, A.

{"question":"How do cleaning requirements differ between rugs and hardwood floors when dealing with spills and regular maintenance?","answer":"For rugs, spills should be immediately blotted with paper towels, followed by detergent application and careful blotting (not rubbing). Heavy stains require dry-solvent cleaners, while pet accidents need citrus-oxygen cleaners. Regular maintenance includes weekly vacuuming and annual professional cleaning. For hardwood floors, spills must be wiped up immediately with a slightly dampened towel to prevent permanent staining. Never wet-mop hardwood floors as water can damage the wood and dull the finish. Regular maintenance involves sweeping with a microfiber dusting pad or soft bristle broom, and using Bona Swedish Hardwood Floor Cleaner for general cleaning.","context":["Rugs can make an easy and comfortable accessory for any room, especially taking into account that they come in all shapes, sizes, patterns and colors. It is a great way of bringing everything together in the room and adding a finishing touch to it.\nHowever, in case of any damage, stains or wear, the rug can also ruin the overall look of the room. So in order to avoid that, you should be taking good care of your rugs and following the necessary steps to prolong their lives.\nFirst of all, you should clean your rugs regularly. For most materials, regular vacuuming can do the trick of removing surface dirt and soil. Vacuum your rugs thoroughly once a week and you will be good to go.\nSmaller rugs can also be simply shaken to remove surface dust and dirt. Keep in mind that vacuuming will only be helpful to remove pet hair and soil. Any small objects like coins, needles, paper clips and so on, should be picked up by hand, or else you will ruin your vacuum.\nPay special attention to the material of the rug: silk rugs, for example, are very gentle and require professional cleaning and over time all area rugs will require some form of professional cleaning. But don’t confuse area rug cleaning with carpet cleaning.\nBesides vacuuming, you should spot clean your rugs when necessary. In case of spills and stains, immediately blot the area with a clean paper towel to absorb the liquid. Any solids should be scooped up off the rug immediately. After blotting the area, use some detergent to clean it. Once again, blot the detergent instead of rubbing it. If you rub it, there is a chance of smudging the stain even further. Use detergents on a small unexposed area of the rug at first, to make sure that it doesn’t fade out the color or damage the fibers.\nAfter cleaning, rinse the area with water, if appropriate, and let it dry thoroughly. For any heavy stains, like gravy, oil or butter, use a dry-solvent cleaner. For pet urine or vomit, use a citrus-oxygen cleaner or a detergent solution, rinse and blot dry after. In case of vomit or pet urine, it is better to have the area disinfected as well since the contaminated area can lead to sickness and disease.\nIn general, pay attention to the tags whenever purchasing a rug. Some rugs are machine-washable, which will make your life much easier. However, make sure the rug dries completely before using it again, as the moisture in rugs can lead to mold growth. It is better to dry your rugs on a clothes-drying rack, so they don’t get stretched out under their own weight.\nAnother useful tip: turn your rugs every once in a while. As the exposed areas of rugs have a higher chance of being worn, as well as getting faded, take your time to turn the rugs once or twice a year to even out the signs of wear.\nLast but not least, make sure to get your rigs professionally cleaned at least once a year. Deep clean is necessary to get rid of any pet dander, dust mites, bacteria and so on. It will also freshen up your rug and prolong its life.","Wood floors are one of the easiest floor types to maintain. Here are a few do’s and dont’s that will help keep your wood floors looking their best. The vast majority of wood floors have a polyurethane finish. It is never a good idea to wax or oil a polyurethane finish. You also DO NOT want to use any harsh cleaning agents such as Comet©, SOS® Pads, or Murphy’s® Oil Soap on your hardwood floors. Also, do not use steam cleaners on your hardwood floors. For general day to day cleaning, we recommend Bona’s Hardwood Floor Care System. Please call us if you would like to purchase a cleaning kit. There are also some easy things you can do to maintain your hardwood floors:\n1. Sweep often\nDirt and grime are the enemies of your wood floors. Use a microfiber dusting pad to pick up the maximum amount of dirt. Dirt and grit will scratch the surface. If you do not own a microfiber dusting pad, we recommend sweeping with a soft bristle broom or vacuuming with a soft brush attachment. Remember to clean any throw rugs or door mats regularly because the dirt from them can easily spread to your hardwoods.\n2. Wipe Up Spills Immediately\nClean spills right away, especially if the spill has color to it. This can permanently stain your hardwood floor if left to soak in. Use a slightly dampened towel.\n3. Never Wet-Mop a Wood Floor\nFor general cleaning, never wet-mop a wood floor. Water can dull the finish, damage the wood, and leave a discoloring residue. Use the Bona Swedish Hardwood Floor Cleaner and spray directly on the floor or on the microfiber cleaning pad.\nIn addition to regular day to day maintenance, we also recommend the following preventative measures. These tips will extend the life of your floors by lengthening the intervals between resurfacing your floor. Remember, it’s not uncommon for hardwood floors to last 50+ years with proper maintenance.\n1. Schedule a Kimminau Clean and Coat.\nThis is the single most effective way to extend the life of your floors. This one-day process deep cleans your wood floors and applies a protective coating to the floors to help restore the shine. This can be done every year or two and helps prolong the life of your floor’s finish.\n2. Use Throw Rugs\nDirt and debris are enemies to your wood floor. Throw rugs capture grit and keep it from being tracked onto your wood floor where it can cause damage through abrasion. Some recommended places include both inside and outside of doorways, in front of kitchen appliances, and in high traffic areas. But don’t add throw rugs until 30 days after your floor has been refinished. This gives the finish time to cure properly.\n3. Use Fabric Pads or Glides Under Table Legs\nPut soft fabric pads or glides under the legs of tables and chairs to prevent scratching the floor when they are moved. Clean these pads regularly to keep grit from getting embedded in them. A pad with grit in it is no better than a hard chair leg. Occasionally, you will have to replace these glides if they get too dirty or lose their stickiness and fall off. They are available at most furniture and hardware stores and are inexpensive.\n4. Check Your Shoes\nSports shoes with cleats can damage a wood floor, so never walk on the floor while wearing these. Even women’s high heels can cause dents, so it’s best to take them off. Definitely check to make sure the heel pad is not worn down to the nail. This can do serious damage to a wood floor. Both men’s and women’s shoes should be examined regularly and properly maintained to avoid damaging the wood surface.\n5. Get a Dolly When Moving Heavy Furniture\nMoving heavy items like furniture can easily damage your floors. Sliding, rolling or dragging furniture, appliances or other heavy items across your hardwood floors can scratch, scrape and even gouge your floor. If you cannot pick up the item, we suggest using a dolly or cart with air-inflated rubber tires.\n6. Control Humidity\nHumidity in a home changes with the seasons. Although we take measures to acclimate your wood floors to the environment before installing them, gaps and cracks can appear in the winter months. Installing a humidity control system will help greatly. Ask your HVAC dealer to recommend a whole house humidifier to help keep moisture in the air in the winter months. In the summer, keep your air conditioner on or run a dehumidifier.\n7. Trim Your Pets’ Nails\nPets can cause major damage to wood floors. Be sure to keep dogs nails trimmed to minimize surface scratches. Even the most durable of finishes can be scratched by dogs so use rugs in traffic areas and other areas where your pets spend the most time."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:299f7a52-be5d-477d-ba0c-ee5b941bb956>","<urn:uuid:4afcebe0-12fa-4e02-815f-f95fa1ba3d7e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does the severity and classification of property-related crimes compare between larceny theft cases and cases requiring bail?","answer":"Larceny is classified based on the value of stolen items - thefts of items worth $1,500 or less are misdemeanors punishable by up to 1 year in jail and/or $500 fine, while thefts over $1,500 or involving firearms are felonies. The bail amount varies based on the specific charges, with misdemeanors being 'lesser criminal acts' punishable by less than a year in jail, while felonies are serious offenses carrying over one year imprisonment up to life sentences and thousands in fines.","context":["As reported in the April 7, 2015 edition of the Providence Journal, a Bristol Police officer was arrested and charged with breaking and entering of a dwelling house and misdemeanor larceny.

Understanding the criminal process, your rights, and what to do when, where, and how can make or break your case. If you or someone you love has been contacted by the police regarding an investigation, arrested, or charged, it always helps to speak with an attorney.\nBelow are a list of frequently asked questions that I received through email or the phone, this is my response:\nThe police have called and said that they just want to ask a few questions and that I am not a suspect, what do I do?\nCall a lawyer. Always have an attorney present during any interaction with the police, even those that appear harmless. Police are legally allowed to lie to you during an interrogation in order to get a confession. You can be 100% innocent and accidentally place yourself at a crime scene or surrender information that makes you look guilty just by how they ask questions. Your memory is not perfect and neither are the police. I cannot emphasize this enough to people: nothing good ever comes from speaking with police without your attorney.\nThe police have said that if I cooperate with them and refuse a lawyer, they’ll go easy on me. Is this true?\nNo. I am a former attorney at the Clark County Public Defender’s Office and can tell you right now that the only person who has any say in your charges is the district attorney. That is a tactic often used by the police to get a confession out of you. It is their job to appear nice, friendly, and on your side so that they can get the most evidence out of you without the benefit of an attorney protecting your rights.\nDo I need a criminal attorney?\nIt is during the period when the police are investigating you that you get the most out of your lawyer. Not only can they prevent you from accidentally saying something that will incriminate you, but also they ensure that your rights are being protected. The lawyer will force them to also investigate evidence that favors your innocence and can be the one steering the conversation to protect you.\nIs it ever okay to speak to the police alone?\nNo. See above.\nIt’s “just pot” do I really need a lawyer anymore?\nAny charge, especially for an activity that may raise its head again, requires a lawyer to assist in getting the charges reduced or dismissed so that you have no criminal record going forward. Judges don’t appreciate seeing the same individuals in their courtroom repeatedly, and employers may not feel the same about “just pot” as you do.\nMy _________has been arrested. What is the bail process and how much will I need to bring?\nBail is an insurance policy, of sorts, that the defendant will show back up if released. How much bail depends on the charges you are facing. Not all cases require bail. Call a Bail Bonds Company to find out their fees and what fees (if any) are returned on completion of your case.\nWhat is the difference between a misdemeanor and a felony?\nA misdemeanor is by definition “a lesser criminal act,” that is punished through fines and jail time of less than a year. Examples are possession of pot, solicitation, and shoplifting. A felony is a serious criminal offense that is punished through jail or prison time of over a year to life, and fines upwards to several thousand dollars. Most violent crimes are felonies, as well as, major theft crimes, drug trafficking crimes, and sex crimes.\nDon’t be stupid, keep your damn mouth shut and Call Kuzemka Law Group NOW!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3789a287-5cae-48c4-b05f-86a5a4043881>","<urn:uuid:376f98b5-771a-4e54-bde8-022ca4a671b2>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As a food safety researcher, I'm curious: how do corrugated packaging containers compare to reusable plastic crates in terms of bacterial contamination, and what are the broader environmental implications of single-use packaging?","answer":"Corrugated packaging demonstrates superior food safety performance compared to reusable plastic crates (RPCs). Research showed that fruit packed in corrugated had significantly lower bacterial contamination levels - for example, E. coli contamination never exceeded 25% in corrugated containers versus up to 95% in RPCs under high storage temperatures. Fruit in plastic crates reached spoilage levels 48-72 hours earlier than in corrugated trays. However, this advantage comes with environmental trade-offs, as single-use packaging contributes to waste management challenges and environmental pollution. This has led to increased scrutiny and regulations on single-use materials, pushing the industry to explore sustainable alternatives and adopt more environmentally friendly practices through initiatives like circular economy programs and improved recycling infrastructure.","context":["Jul 7, 2016Research claims fruit packed in corrugated is safer than in RPCs\nNew scientific research indicates that corrugated packaging keeps fruit fresher and safer than reusable plastic crates (RPCs) and can significantly reduce contamination from transferred microorganisms.\nThe research, conducted by the University of Bologna and initiated by the European Federation of Corrugated Board Manufacturers (FEFCO), found that corrugated trays ensured higher-quality packed fruits with reduced microbial cross-contamination and longer shelf life. Lower bacterial contamination decreases the risk of foodborne illnesses and increases the fruit’s freshness, scent, appearance and taste, according to the study.\nMicrobiological contamination of fresh produce is a major concern for retailers. Pathogenic bacteria can make people sick, and spoilage bacteria reduces shelf-life. In both cases, the role of packaging can be critical.\n“We are encouraged by the most recent research conducted by the University of Bologna”, said Dennis Colley, president and CEO of the U.S.-based Fibre Box Association (FBA). “We know corrugated is clean when it reaches the grower/shipper. Now, this research shows corrugated, in addition to cushioning and protecting produce, also mitigates the spread of contamination if the container becomes contaminated while packing or if fresh produce begins to decay during transportation. The ability of corrugated packaging to increase shelf-life could translate into significantly reduced shrink and potentially millions of dollars in savings for retailers.”\nThe research was led by professor Rosalba Lanciotti at the University of Bologna’s Department of Agricultural and Food Sciences. It examined the exchange of microbes between produce and packaging and vice-versa, focused especially on determining how differences in packaging materials can influence cross-contamination.\nThe results showed that fruit packed in corrugated fared better (with fewer transferred pathogenic and spoilage bacteria) than the fruit packed in RPCs. The differences in microbiological quality were statistically significant, according to the study.\nScientists deliberately contaminated both corrugated trays and RPCs with the same number of Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pseudomonas spp. microorganisms. Fresh peaches were washed with tap water, sterilized with a sodium solution, rinsed with sterilized water and then air-dried before being placed into the containers for testing. Next, researchers measured the levels of bacteria that transferred to the fruit over time.\nFruit packed in plastic crates reached contamination levels generally associated with spoilage 48 to 72 hours earlier than the fruit packed in corrugated trays, the study found.\nContributing factors such as storage temperature, length of time before sale, and superficial damage on the peaches were also considered. Results showed that all these factors influenced the microbial transfer from packaging material to fruit, but the transfer of spoilage microorganisms was always lower in corrugated trays.\nThe tests also showed that in some conditions (i.e. high storage temperature) up to 95 percent of peaches packed in the deliberately contaminated RPCs were infected with E. coli after 48 hours. By contrast, the E. coli contamination level never exceeded 25 percent of the peaches packed in corrugated containers that had been contaminated with the same levels of microorganisms, the study showed.\nThe research comes as other concerns have been raised recently over the hygiene of RPCs. Last November, the Department of Food Science at the University of Arkansas showed that typical industry cleaning procedures failed to adequately sanitize RPCs. The research team led by Steven Ricke found Salmonella cells on the crates even after cleaning. He noted that bacteria hide in the cracks and crevices of the crates’ surface, making it difficult for industrial sanitizers to reach them.\nUniversity of Bologna’s new study proved that using corrugated instead of plastic packaging for fruit can significantly reduce potential contamination via microbial transfer. Professor Lanciotti and her team concluded that peaches packed in corrugated therefore reach consumers in a safer and fresher state than those in plastic crates.","Single-use plastic packaging refers to the use of plastic materials for packaging products that are intended to be used once and then discarded. This type of packaging is widely used across various industries, including food and beverages, healthcare, personal care, and household products. Single-use plastic packaging offers convenience and affordability, but it has also raised concerns due to its negative environmental impact.\nSingle-use plastic packaging is any form of packaging made from plastic materials that are designed for one-time use.

{"question":"I am worried about food supply. Why should we care about bees dying?","answer":"Bees are crucial for food production as they are the most important pollinators of many fruits and vegetables. Of the 100 crop species that provide 90% of our global food supply, 71 are bee-pollinated. The current honeybee-death rate is so high that the species might not survive, which could have major impacts on world food supplies.","context":["From the fuzzy bumblebees that our children chase in the garden to the industrious honeybees that sweeten our herbal tea, bees have woven an essential place in nature's mosaic. But bees are now caught in the toxic web of our climate crisis.\nYou may have heard that the decline of these buzzy pollinators could have severe impacts on food production. As global warming impacts our climate, changes in plant-flowering times have led to a massive decline in bee colonies. This trouncing is called \"colony collapse disorder\" (CCD). CCD threatens the health of an important species of bees: honeybees. And according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, CCD also sounds a warning alarm on \"the economic stability of commercial beekeeping and pollination operations in the United States.\"\nThis Nature Conservancy article reports:\nAt least four species of formerly common North American bumble bees have experienced catastrophic declines over the past decade -- two of them may be on the brink of extinction. Preliminary investigations by many scientists indicate that a number of other formerly common species are also less abundant than they were in the past.\nWhy Do Bees Matter?\nYou may be thinking, \"Bees sting. Why would I want them in my garden buzzing around my kids?\"\nActually, most bees don't sting, although a few species defend their nest. (Bumblebees are an exception.) Bees generally only use their stingers in defense. And get this: Only females are capable of stinging.\nHere's how bees work:\n- Bees visit flowers because they need to eat.\nAccording to Marla Spivak, a distinguished McKnight professor in entomology at the University of Minnesota:\nHoneybees and wild bees are the most important pollinators of many of the fruits and vegetables we eat. Of 100 crop species that provide 90% of our global food supply, 71 are bee-pollinated.\nWhy Do Bees Need Us?\nJust like our families need good, clean food to eat, so do our bee pollinators. But that has changed. So why don't the bees have enough good, clean food?\nAlong with neonicotinoids -- a class of pesticides known to be toxic to bees; sprayed widely by agriculture companies such as Bayer, Monsanto and Dow; and found in plant pollen and nectar (bee food) -- climate change may be causing flowers to open before bees emerge from hibernation. As flower opening is synchronized with seasonal changes, this disruption leads to pollination declines.\nWhy Is It So Important to Protect Bees?\nWe need bees to pollinate our fruit, vegetable plants and wildflowers. According to The Guardian:\nDeclining numbers of bees and other pollinators have been causing growing concern in recent years, as scientists fear that decreased pollination could have major impacts on world food supplies.\nJust recently the U.S. government released an alarming report stating that the honeybee-death rate is currently too high for the species to even survive.\nSo What Can We Do to Help Bees Survive?\nWhether you see or hear bees where you live, they inhabit every urban yard and garden.\nIn your garden:\n- Create a pollinator preserve with your family. Invite bees by including some of these flowering plants: strawberries, raspberries, snapdragons, carrots, daisies, asters, sunflowers, mint and lavender.\nBecome a citizen scientist with Bumble Bee Watch to assist with pollinator conservation. Here's how:\n- Photograph the bees in your garden. Identify the bee species with this chart.\n\"Bee\" informed.

{"question":"How can hypothermia occur during summer canoeing, and what precautions should be taken with campfires in outdoor settings?","answer":"Hypothermia can occur during summer canoeing because mountain rivers can be as cold as 40° even in summertime. Staying wet for extended periods without drying off can gradually lead to hypothermia, with signs including decreased sensory perception and reduced awareness of surroundings. Regarding campfire precautions, fires must only be built in designated areas using fire rings or pits. Campers should use dry firewood, either brought from home or gathered from fallen pieces away from the campsite. Never cut living trees or branches. The fire should be started with small twigs, then built up with larger hardwood pieces. Before leaving or sleeping, the fire must be completely extinguished with water, and ashes should be cool to the touch.","context":["Your Canoe Equipment Checklist is one part of your camping trip. It also can be used by those planning a Kayak Camping trip, with just a few edits. The checklist at the bottom of this page can be used as a starting point. Make changes to fit your needs, time of year and area you will be camping in.\nWhen review the list, think about how much room you will have, and how long you will be gone. Think small, compact and is it necessary. There is not one person who has gone camping that has over or under packed. As you review the list, start with the basics and go from there.\nMake sure you adjust your Canoe Equipment Checklist to consider seasonal temperatures and type of waterways traveled. If the campsite is one on a lake that you will be returning to every evening, then add some items from our tent camping checklist.\nOn the other hand, if your trip is headed down river, then a single tent or no tent (just a tarp) may be needed. A camping hammock would be ideal for this type of camping. The backpacking checklist can help here with some items that may not appear on this list.\nAbove all, make sure you have emergency rations of food, clean drinking water, and First Aid Kit. One mishap with a poorly packed canoe and you'll find yourself without the basic necessities to stay alive.\nOne of the hidden dangers of canoeing or kayaking is not the possibility of drowning. The danger comes from the body beginning to shut down due to hypothermia.\nMany mountain rivers can be as cold as 40° in the summertime. Staying wet for most of the day without pulling off, and getting a chance to dry off, and warm up can bring on hypothermia and it can happen very gradually.\nIf a person has begun to show signs of lack of sensory perception and lack of awareness of surroundings, then there is a good chance that the body temperature has begun to drop and the body is shutting down.\nRead up on what emergency actions need to be started to bring someone out of this dangerous state. There are many websites and medical journals that can offer simple to follow steps on both preventing hypothermia and what to do to for someone with hypothermia.\nCamping Equipment Checklist\nCooking Equipment (cont'd)\n|Aluminum Foil (Heavy Duty)||Mitts, Oven||Bungi cords/straps|\n|Bottle opener/corkscrew||Mugs/cups||Duct tape/electrical tape|\n|Water bottles||Paper Plates, Bowls, Cups||Dust pan / Whisk broom|\n|Mixing bowls||Paper Towels / Napkins||Glue/super glue|\n|Can Opener||Pot Grabber||Hatchet|\n|canister, Food-storage||Pot Holders||Knife or Multi-Tool|\n|Charcoal and Lighter Fluid||roasting sticks||Knife sharpener|\n|chimney, charcoal||Plastic Silverware||Machete|\n|Coffee Pot||Camp Stove||Mallet or Hammer|\n|container(s), Collapsible water||thermos||Pliers, wrench|\n|Cook Set (pots & pans)||Trash bags; resalable bags||Saw|\n|cooler||Utensils (spoons, spatula, etc)||Small shovel / Trowel|\n|cups, plastic||Ziploc bags||\n|Dish Soap & Dish Rags||\n|Dish towels||Door mat||Flashlight|\n|Egg holder(s)||Multi-tool or knife||Lantern with fuel/mantles|\n|Extension sticks/roasting items||Seam sealant||Maglight|\n|Fuel (propane, white gas, etc.)||Stakes|\n|Funnel||Sun shade, tarp or screen house|\n|Grill||Tent (with stakes and guy lines)||\n|Grill rack||Tent repair kit||\n|Hot-cold vacuum bottle||Tent-pole repair sleeve||Blankets|\n|Water Jug||Utility bags for storage||Fleece sleeping bag liner|\n|Lighter fluid||Sleeping Bag|\n|Measuring cups & spoons||Pillows|","Respecting nature should be a top priority anytime you relax or play in the great outdoors. Camping safety and protecting yourself from common outdoor hazards should be just as important. Each year, thousands of accidents occur in the outdoors as a result of camper and backpacker carelessness. Protect yourself with these camping safety tips.\nCampfire negligence is a leading cause of forest fires and also causes many camping injuries and deaths. Only build your campfires in designated areas. Most campgrounds provide fire rings or pits for campfires or you can use a Coleman fireplace to safely contain your campfire. Keep the area surrounding your campfire free of trash and other debris that could ignite and set your tent, chairs, and other gear a safe distance from the flame.\nMany campgrounds and state parks provide wood for campfires for a small price, but supplies are often low during peak seasons. Bring your own dry firewood to avoid taking wood from the natural area. If you do gather firewood at your campsite, only take pieces already on the ground. Never cut trees or branches within the campground or park and find your wood away from your campsite.\nBegin your fire with a small stack of twigs. Aromatic cedar and pine and other soft woods burn quickly and make excellent fire starters. Use a match to light the dry sticks and add larger pieces of dry hardwood as the campfire strengthens. Burn any garbage or waste that will burn to reduce the amount of waste you carry out and to limit your use of firewood. Before leaving your campsite, completely extinguish your campfire using water. Stir the ashes and pour more water on the embers. Make sure the ashes are cool to the touch before leaving the campsite and remove any debris that didn’t burn.\nAlways keep water close by whenever you have a campfire. Breezes and wind can cause embers to spread quickly. Keep the campfire at a reasonable level and never leave it unattended. Put your campfire out before going to sleep each evening.\nThe wild animals you may encounter in the great outdoors can be beautiful and amazing to watch, but can also be quite harmful and even deadly if you’re not careful. Anytime you see a wild animal, observe the animal from a safe distance. Never try to feed a wild animal and avoid sudden movements or closing in on the animal. Report any strange wildlife behavior to the park ranger to warn of possible rabies.\nTo reduce the risk of bears or other animals in your campsite, never leave food and drinks out in the open. Cover all your food and keep the containers inside your car or suspended from a tree out of animal reach. Garbage should be burned, immediately disposed of, or suspended in the air as well. To prevent bears, hang your bags at least 12 feet high and 4 feet away from the trunk of the tree. Avoid storing food inside your tent and take out any snacks before bedtime."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:672a4220-d453-4b20-a21e-b191f239d758>","<urn:uuid:9ad5c601-d89f-4098-86e8-9bef76788db1>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are Kant's three propositions about moral worth and duty?","answer":"The three propositions are: 1) To have moral worth, an action must be done from duty, 2) An action done from duty does not have its moral worth in the purpose which is to be achieved through it but in the maxim by which it is determined, and 3) Duty is the necessity of an action executed from respect for law.","context":["Well, I never did get to Paris. A sinus infection intervened. But with the assistance of Amazon.com, I purchased a copy of the Lewis White Beck translation of the Grundlegung from a little bookshop in Oregon, so I am ready to continue the tutorial.\nIf you approach the Grundlegung knowing that it is widely considered one of the two or three most important texts in the history of Western Ethical Theory, the first thing that will strike you is how short it is: barely eighty pages in the Beck translation [seventy-five in the original German edition.] Now, I am myself given to writing short books, so I do not disparage a work merely because it does not spread itself over five or six hundred pages, but eighty pages does seem a bit slight. Not to worry. We shall find that it has more than enough powerful philosophy in it to keep the most dedicated student busy for quite some time.\nThe structure of the work is somewhat unbalanced. After a six page Preface, there are three Sections. The first runs a bit more than thirteen pages, the second is fully forty-two pages long -- more than half of the total book -- and the last section, the third, is seventeen pages.\nThe logical structure of the exposition is quite straightforward. In Section One, Kant begins with what he takes to be the ordinary moral beliefs of good, decent Prussian peasants, and attempts to show that contained within those beliefs, if one thinks about it carefully, is a form of the principle of action that he calls variously The Moral Law and The Categorical Imperative [I shall explain the distinction a bit later on.] Kant does not for a moment imagine that he is putting forward a new principle of morality. Indeed, he thinks that such a notion is absurd. But a good deal of over-intellectual philosophizing has served to confuse good people about what they all know in their bones, so he proposes to put our common understanding of morality on an absolutely firm footing.\nHowever well-argued Section One may be, its conclusions are open to the objection that they are at all persuasive only to someone who happens to share the common understanding of morality that Kant there assumes, so in Section Two, Kant begins all over again with the concept of a Will, and undertakes to demonstrate what he has in Section One assumed. This is quite obviously a daunting task, so we ought not to be surprised that it consumes fully half of the little book. In Section Two, we find an explication of the notion of a Categorical Imperative and a derivation of its several of its alternative formulations, as well as the famous Four Examples of the Categorical Imperative, and the equally famous discussions of Humanity as an End in Itself and the Realm of Ends.\nSection Two, I should note, contains a brief paragraph with the heading \"The Autonomy of the Will as the Supreme Principle of Morality,\" in case anyone has ever wondered where I got the central, idea for my little book, In Defense of Anarchism. This is of course also the source for the title of my Commentary on the Grundlegung, The Autonomy of Reason.\nSection Three is devoted to dealing with the extremely tricky question of the precise logical status of the conclusions of Section Two. Inasmuch as Kant has, he believes, established in the First Critique that we can never have knowledge of things as they are in themselves, and since he believes that it is as a self-in-itself, and not as a phenomenon in the Realm of Appearance, that my Reason can be practical, which is to say that I can in the full sense act, it is incumbent upon him to explain just what the status is of the propositions he purports to have established about rational willing and the principles that guide us as moral agents. It is in this Section that Kant resolves the conflict between Free Will and Determinism, insofar as that conflict can in fact be resolved.\nWell, that is the big picture. Now we must descend into the weeds a bit. Let us consider these sections in sequence.\nIn the Western tradition, there are several very different questions that seem to have motivated philosophers to write about what we can recognize as Ethics. The first, historically, is the question posed repeatedly by Plato in the Dialogues: What is the Good Life? Is it a life devoted to the enjoyment of pleasure and the avoidance of pain? Is it a life of contemplation and meditation? Is it a life of virtuous action?\nA second question is posed by the philosophers known as Utilitarians: Is there a way of calculating what I ought to do, especially when confronted by difficult choices among competing claims upon my allegiance? Ought I to weigh the pains and pleasures that my actions will cause myself or others? Ought I to try to formulate some general rules to which I can adhere when faced with hard choices?\nNeither of these questions seems to be what motivates Kant. Instead, we might put his question in this way: Knowing as I do, indeed as all good, decent people do, what I ought to do, how shall I understand and deal with the inner struggle between this knowledge and the many temptations to be ignore what I know to be my duty and to stray into a path of immorality? In short, what is it my duty to do?\n\"Nothing in the world -- indeed nothing even beyond the world --can possibly be conceived which could be called good without qualification except a good will.\" Thus Kant begins Section One. It is, when you think about it, a rather odd place to start. Neither Plato nor Aristotle nor Hobbes nor Hume nor Bentham would have recognized that statement as an appropriate place to begin an investigation of ethical theory, or indeed as an appropriate component of such an investigation at all.\nIt is worth quoting several passages from this opening Section of the Grundlegung to convey the flavor of Kant's ethical discourse. Let me offer just two, from the first four pages:\n\"Intelligence, wit, judgment, and the other talents of the mind, however they may be named, or courage, resolution, and perseverance as qualities of temperament,, are doubtless in many respects good and desirable. But they can become very bad and harmful if the will, which is to make use of these gifts of nature and which in its special constitution is called character, is not good. (and so forth.)\"\n\"[T]he more a cultivated reason deliberately devotes itself to the enjoyment of life and happiness, the more the man falls short of true contentment. [This at least Aristotle would have agreed with... ed.] From this fact, there arises in many persons, if only they be candid enough to admit it, a certain degree of misology, hatred of reason.\"\nIt comes as a surprise to learn that in his youth, Kant played billiards and was thought to be something of a man about town, although to be sure that town was Königsberg.\nThe bulk of Section One is devoted to stating and arguing for three propositions, each of which, Kant believes, is either acknowledged by common moral opinion or else follows directly from propositions that are so acknowledged. The three propositions are:\nFirst: To have moral worth, an action must be done from duty [and not from inclination. ed.]\nSecond: An action done from duty does not have its moral worth in the purpose which is to be achieved through it but in the maxim by which it is determined.\nThird: Duty is the necessity of an action executed from respect for law.\nIn the next part, we shall explore these three propositions a bit and see where they lead."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0dae5d2c-962d-473d-9ad2-6352ba7b0fc9>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do free market capitalism and state capitalism differ in their approach to government intervention and economic decision-making?","answer":"Free market capitalism and state capitalism differ fundamentally in their approach to government intervention and decision-making. In free market capitalism, the state's role is limited to enabling wealth generation by enforcing contracts and limiting negative influences like greed. The focus is on profit-driven decisions and fair economic competition. In contrast, state capitalism is characterized by dominant government control where political goals take precedence over individual rights, economic productivity, and consumer choice. State capitalists control both the economic players and the regulators, using tools like national oil corporations, state-owned enterprises, national champions, and sovereign wealth funds to advance state objectives rather than purely market-driven outcomes.","context":["Political risk guru Ian Bremmer examines the growing momentum of \"state capitalism\" in his new book The End of the Free Market: Who Wins the War between States and Corporations? (Portfolio, May 2010). Bremmer argues that state capitalism differs from free-market capitalism in that politics rather than profit is the main driver of decision-making. For this reason, it threatens to curtail free markets and the global economy. It is the latest chapter in the \"rise of the rest,\" or the expansion of non-Western states in the international system.\nCapitalism takes many forms but all of them can be distinguished by their \"use of wealth to create more wealth, a broad enough definition to capture both free-market and state capitalism,\" Bremmer notes. In the free-market form of capitalism, the job of the state is to \"enable\" wealth generation by enforcing contracts and limiting the influence of moral bads such as greed—the latter can lead to market failures, which have occurred periodically since the Dutch tulip craze of 1637. Free-market governments attempt to ensure that the economic game is played fairly.\nIn contrast to free-market capitalism, the economy in state-capitalist regimes is dominated by the state agenda. \"Forced to choose between the protection of the rights of the individual, economic productivity, and the principle of consumer choice, on the one hand, and the achievement of political goals, on the other, state capitalists will choose the latter every time,\" Bremmer explains. Continuing the sports game analogy, state capitalists control the referees as well as the main players.\nBremmer admits that state capitalism isn't new. He traces the first reference to an 1896 speech by Wilhelm Liebknecht, a founder of the Social Democratic Party of Germany. But due to recent questions regarding the merits of free markets after the 2008–2009 financial crisis, the need for job growth and economic stability in less-than-democratic regimes, and the growth of the economies and influence of state-capitalist countries, this form of capitalism is catching on worldwide.\nWhile there is \"no single model of state capitalism,\" its leading practitioners, China and Russia, \"share a well-developed sense of risk aversion,\" having recently abandoned communism as their guiding philosophies. Other notable users of this model include energy-rich states, such as Angola, Iran, Kuwait, Malaysia, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Venezuela. Another cluster of countries in this group, some of which have benefited from rising commodity prices, include emerging markets that have only tentatively committed to free-market principles, such as Brazil, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Mexico, South Africa, and Turkey.\nAnother way to identify a state-capitalist country is by looking at the use of four specific policy tools. One policy tool favored by state capitalists is the national oil (and gas) corporation (NOC), such as Gazprom of Russia, China National Petroleum Corporation, and the National Iranian Oil Company. NOCs like these own 75 percent of the world's crude-oil reserves. A second tool is the state-owned enterprise, such as China's First Automobile Works.\nA third tool is privately-owned companies—so-called national champions—that are supported by the state to develop a \"commanding position\" in an economy. The Brazilian mining concern Vale, according to Bremmer, is a prominent example of a company that was coerced by its government to advance the state objective of stimulating the economy.\nA final tool is the sovereign wealth fund (SWF), the largest of which includes the UAE's Abu Dhabi Investment Authority valued at $300–650 billion and Saudi Arabia's Monetary Agency valued at $430–500 billion. Many types of governments have SWFs but they \"tend to be as transparent—or as secretive—as their governments,\" Bremmer writes, noting that Norway's Government Pension Fund is exceedingly open and accountable. Norway is an example of a country that has some state-capitalist trappings but is not in the state-capitalist camp. Similarly, the U.S. bailout of financial institutions was designed to \"save the free market, not bury it,\" Bremmer notes. \"It's not the tools that count; it's how they're used. But countries that have all four of these institutions tend to be state capitalist,\" he writes.\nHow do these tools threaten the free market? While Bremmer is careful not to predict a new Cold War, he does worry about fissures in the international system and state-capitalist support for undemocratic regimes such as Guinea. As the head of Eurasia Group, a political risk company, it is Bremmer's job to ask what if. He poses at least ten hypothetical scenarios in the book, including given the mutually assured economic destruction (or interdependence) between the United States and China, what happens if China closes the door?\nWhile the phrase \"The End of the Free Market\" may capture public anxiety in America today, Bremmer should have called his book \"The End of State Capitalism\"—he bets that free markets will win the \"war\" with statists. First, state capitalism just doesn't have the same appeal as an ideology that communism had, it is \"more a set of governing principles than a coherent political ideology.\" Second, state capitalism is actually a sign of domestic political vulnerability. It is a response to the risks countries face as they open up, which Bremmer detailed in his earlier book The J Curve. Meanwhile, free markets hold several advantages over their statist cousins: Most importantly, these systems better facilitate innovation and long-term growth.\nBremmer lays out several recommendations to ensure that free markets do indeed prevail. Most of these recommendations are just good common sense for America: keep markets open, invest in hard power, pick the right fights, and welcome world-class foreign workers. Bremmer is saying subtly that for America to continue to lead it should be strong, smart, and principled. In other words, it should stay true to its values.","Capitalism vs. Socialism: An Overview\nCapitalism and socialism are the two primary economic systems used to understand the world and the way economies work. Their distinctions are many, but perhaps the fundamental difference between capitalism and socialism lies in the scope of government intervention in the economy. The capitalist economic model relies on free-market conditions to drive innovation and wealth creation and regulate corporate behavior; this liberalization of market forces allows for the freedom of choice, resulting in either success or failure. The socialist-based economy incorporates elements of centralized economic planning, utilized to ensure conformity and to encourage equality of opportunity and economic outcome.\n- Capitalism is a market-driven economy. The state does not intervene in the economy, leaving it up to market forces to shape society and life.\n- Socialism is characterized by state ownership of businesses and services. Central planning is used to attempt to make society more equitable.\n- Most countries are mixed economies, falling in between the extremes of capitalism and socialism.\nIn a capitalist economy, property and businesses are owned and controlled by individuals. The production and prices of goods and services are determined by how in-demand they are and how difficult they are to produce. Theoretically, this dynamic drives companies to make the best products they can as cheaply as they can, meaning that consumers can choose the best and cheapest products. Business owners should be driven to find more efficient ways of producing quality goods quickly and cheaply.\nThis emphasis on efficiency takes priority over equality, which is of little concern to the capitalist system. The argument is that inequality is the driving force that encourages innovation, which then pushes economic development. In a capitalist economy, the state does not directly employ the workforce. This can lead to unemployment during times of economic recession.\nWhat is Socialism?\nIn a socialist economy, the state owns and controls the major means of production. In some socialist economic models, worker cooperatives have primacy over production. Other socialist economic models allow individual ownership of enterprise and property, albeit with high taxes and stringent government controls.\nThe primary concern of the socialist model, in contrast, is an equitable redistribution of wealth and resources from the rich to the poor, out of fairness and to ensure \"an even playing field\" in opportunity and outcome. To achieve this, the state intervenes in the labor market. In fact, in a socialist economy, the state is the primary employer. During times of economic hardship, the socialist state can order hiring, so there is full employment even if workers are not performing tasks that are particularly in demand from the market.\nThe other major school of left-wing economic thought is communism. Both communism and socialism oppose capitalism, but there are important distinctions between them.\nIn reality, most countries and their economies fall in between capitalism and socialism/communism. Some countries incorporate both the private sector system of capitalism and the public sector enterprise of socialism to overcome the disadvantages of both systems. These countries are referred to as having mixed economies. In these economies, the government intervenes to prevent any individual or company from having a monopolistic stance and undue concentration of economic power. Resources in these systems may be owned by both state and individuals."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:56d080b6-abd4-48a3-9672-0ce7fd6c215a>","<urn:uuid:bab2b2b8-74bf-4831-8991-62bd48ebaf4d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I've been reading about climate change impacts. What roles do oceans play in regulating climate, and how is acidification affecting their ability to do this?","answer":"Oceans are crucial climate regulators, absorbing 1/3 of human-produced carbon and 93% of excess heat from global warming. The top 10 feet of ocean hold as much heat as our entire atmosphere. While this has helped shield the world from rapid climate change, the ocean's ability to maintain this absorption rate is uncertain. As the oceans continue to absorb CO2, they become increasingly acidic - a process happening 100 times faster than anything experienced in tens of millions of years. Scientists project that by 2100, under business-as-usual scenarios, ocean pH could decrease by another 0.3-0.4 units, representing a 150% increase in acidity over preindustrial times. Over the next few thousand years, scientists estimate 90% of anthropogenic CO2 emissions will be absorbed by the ocean, potentially affecting vital biological and geochemical processes that marine ecosystems depend on.","context":["At a side event on oceans at COP 22 Dr. Kyle Van Houtan, Duke alum and current director of science at the Monterey Bay Aquarium, claimed, “the oceans are the lungs of the planet and the heart of the climate change”. While this seems like a bold statement especially somewhere like the COP, if we consider the huge role that oceans play in all of our lives we see that the importance of oceans cannot be overstated. Oceans:\n- cover 71% of the earth\n- contain 96% of the living space on earth\n- are home to 80% of earths living organisms\n- provide the biggest source of wild or domestic protein in the world\n- create almost half the oxygen we breathe\n- carry 90% of world trade\n- hold an estimated 80% of the worlds mineral resources\nDespite the importance of oceans, until last year they had not received much attention within COP. Although they are often discussed indirectly in topics such as adaptation, mitigation, disaster displacement, fisheries and the blue economy, the Paris Agreement is the first of the UNFCCC agreements in which oceans have been acknowledged. Last year at COP 21, Oceans Inc. reported on the over 70 events dedicated to oceans documenting their increased prominence, and throughout COP 21 several countries lent support to the ‘Because the Ocean’ Declaration which aims to create a special report on oceans through the IPCC, continue this work at the UN Ocean SDG Conference in Fiji in June 2017, and elaborate on an ocean action plan under the UNFCCC.\nMajor Ways Ocean Affects Climate\nAlthough so many ocean processes and events are crucial to climate health, the most critical phenomenon at this time are ocean warming, ocean acidification and deoxygenation.\nThe oceans have shielded the world from rapid climate change by absorbing 1/3 of the carbon we produce and 93% of excess heat from global warming. The top 10 feet of the ocean hold as much heat as our entire atmosphere, but picking up this slack has not been without consequence and it is unclear how long the oceans can maintain this rate of absorption. As oceans warm, ice melts faster intensifying sea level rise and ocean circulation patterns slow down as there is less cold water being submerged which also affects upwelling. These are just a few of the possible negative implications of warming oceans, but the increased heat in the ocean has profound affects for a plethora of biological, chemical and physical ocean processes.\nA related but separate issue facing the oceans is acidification. As the oceans take up an increasing amount of carbon, the chemical make-up of the water changes and the ocean moves from an alkaline environment to an acidic one. This can be fatally detrimental to much of the marine life that lives there particularly corals and organisms that have an exoskeleton or shell. Although these creatures are most directly affected, this will have implications for entire food webs, including for humans who rely on oceans as an important protein source. The potential harmful ramifications of acidification have been acknowledged by many around the world, including the Plymouth Marine Lab who made this short animation bringing to light the effects of acidification, and can already be seen at home in the US in the Arctic.\nAnother major effect climate change can have on oceans is the level of oxygen in the water. Warmer temperatures reduce oxygen solubility, but surface run off and ocean acidification can also play a role in deoxygenizing the ocean. Declining oxygen concentrations in the water will put stress on organisms that require oxygen to live as, according to National Geographic, low-oxygen areas have expanded by more than 1.7 million square miles in the last 50 years. If deoxygenation continues it will limit where species can live or if they will survive, which could negatively affect fisheries and the populations that rely on them.\nOceans at COP 22\nWhile oceans perhaps weren’t as prominent at COP 22 as they were at COP21, there were several side events dedicated to awareness of oceans, and Prince Albert of Monaco and Princess Lalla of Morocco hosted, along with several other influential figures, Ocean Actions Day. During COP 22, the Ocean Action partners released the Strategic Action Roadmap on Oceans and Climate: 2016 to 2021, which provides comprehensive policy recommendations concerning oceans for the next five years. The roadmap specifically addresses the role of oceans in regulating climate, mitigation, adaptation, displacement, financing, and capacity development.\nWhile these are great steps forward in the process of inclusion of oceans in the UNFCCC, as of now, there is still some discrepancy in who is giving attention to oceans. More than 2/3 of NDC’s include the ocean in some sense, but 14 countries that have coasts don’t include them. Many Annex 1 countries specifically, including the US, don’t address oceans even though they are coastal nations. Despite this, the momentum for addressing oceans in the climate negotiations continues to grow among states, NGO’s, academia and even within religious sectors. As Dr. Nigel Crawhill, representative of the Indigenous Peoples of Africa and the International Network of Buddhists, said in a panel on human abuse of the oceans, “sometimes we can become paralyzed by the complexity of the ocean problem, but in Buddhism the moment of enlightenment is only in the present, only now can we understand the capacity for ourselves to act.” Let us hope as we move forward as individuals, countries, and with each successive COP we continue to act on this important oceans agenda.\nLaffoley, D and Baxter J.M.

National Geographic. March 13, 2015.","What is Ocean Acidification?\nSince the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, when humans began burning coal in large quantities, the world’s ocean water has gradually become more acidic. Like global warming, this phenomenon, which is known as ocean acidification, is a direct consequence of increasing levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) in Earth’s atmosphere.\nPrior to industrialization, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was 280 parts per million (ppm). With increased use of fossil fuels, that number is now approaching 400 ppm and the growth rate is accelerating. Scientists calculate that the ocean is currently absorbing about one quarter of the carbon dioxide that humans are emitting. When carbon dioxide combines with seawater, chemical reactions occur that reduce the seawater pH, hence the term ocean acidification.\nCurrently, about half of the anthropogenic (human-caused) carbon dioxide in the ocean is found in the upper 400 meters (1,200 feet) of the water column, while the other half has penetrated into the lower thermocline and deep ocean. Density- and wind-driven circulation help mix the surface and deep waters in some high latitude and coastal regions, but for much of the open ocean, deep pH changes are expected to lag surface pH changes by a few centuries.\nOcean acidification and global warming are different problems, but are closely linked because they share the same root cause—human emissions of carbon dioxide. The atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide is now higher than it has been for the last 800,000 years and possibly higher than any time in the last 20 million years. Humans have thus far benefited from the ocean’s capacity to hold enormous amounts of carbon, including a large portion of this excess carbon dioxide. Had the ocean not absorbed such vast quantities of carbon dioxide, the atmospheric concentration would be even higher, and the environmental consequences of global warming (sea level rise, shifting weather patterns, more extreme weather events, etc.) and their associated socioeconomic impacts would likely be even more pronounced. However, the oceans cannot continue to absorb carbon dioxide at the current rate without undergoing significant changes in chemistry, biology, and ecosystem structure.\nMeasuring ocean acidification: Past and present\nScientists know that the oceans are absorbing carbon dioxide and subsequently becoming more acidic from measurements made on seawater collected during research cruises, which provide wide spatial coverage over a short time period, and from automated ocean carbon measurements on stationary moorings, which provide long-term, high-resolution data from a single location.\nThese records can be extended back through time using what are known as chemical proxies to provide an indirect measurement of seawater carbonate chemistry. A proxy is a measurement from a natural archive (ice cores, corals, tree rings, marine sediments, etc.) that is used to infer past environmental conditions. For example, by analyzing the chemical composition of tiny fossil shells found in deep ocean sediments, scientists have developed ocean pH records from ancient times when there were no pH meters. Furthermore, because the ocean surface water is in approximate chemical balance, or equilibrium, with the atmosphere above it, a record of historical ocean pH can be inferred from atmospheric carbon dioxide records derived from Greenland and Antarctic ice cores, which contain air bubbles from the ancient atmosphere. Such evidence indicates that current atmospheric carbon dioxideconcentrations and ocean pH levels are at unprecedented for at least the last 800,000 years.\nGoing back deeper in Earth history to the Paleocene-Eocene boundary about 55 million years ago, scientists have found geochemical evidence of a massive release of carbon dioxide accompanied by substantial warming and dissolution of shallow carbonate sediments in the ocean. Although somewhat analogous to what we are observing today, this carbon dioxide release occurred over several thousand years, much more slowly than what we are witnessing today, thus providing time for the oceans partially to buffer the change. In the geologic record, during periods of rapid environmental change, species have acclimated, adapted or gone extinct. Corals have undergone large extinction events in the past (such the Permian extinction 250 million years ago), and new coral species evolved to take their place, but it took millions of years to recover previous levels of biodiversity.\nHow is ocean acidification affecting ocean chemistry?\nSeawater has a pH of 8.2 on average because it contains naturally occurring alkaline ions that come primarily from weathering of continental rocks. When seawater absorbs carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, carbonic acid is produced (see Box 1), reducing the water’s pH. Since the dawn of industrialization, average surface ocean pH has decreased to about 8.1.\nBecause the pH scale is logarithmic (a change of 1 pH unit represents a tenfold change in acidity), this change represents a 26 percent increase in acidity over roughly 250 years, a rate that is 100 times faster than anything the ocean and its inhabitants have experienced in tens of millions of years.\nAcidification can affect many marine organisms, but especially those that build their shells and skeletons from calcium carbonate, such as corals, oysters, clams, mussels, snails, and phytoplankton and zooplankton, the tiny plants and animals that form the base of the marine food web.\nThese “marine calcifiers” face two potential threats associated with ocean acidification: 1) Their shells and skeletons may dissolve more readily as ocean pH decreases and seawater becomes more corrosive; and 2) When CO2 dissolves in seawater, the water chemistry changes such that fewer carbonate ions, the primary building blocks for shells and skeletons, are available for uptake by marine organisms. Marine organisms that build shells or skeletons usually do so through an internal chemical process that converts bicarbonate to carbonate in order to form calcium carbonate.\nExactly how ocean acidification slows calcification rates, or shell formation, is not yet fully understood, but several mechanisms are being studied. Most hypotheses focus on the additional energy an organism must expend to build and maintain its calcium carbonate shells and skeletons in an increasingly corrosive environment. In the face of this extra energy expenditure, exposure to additional environmental stressors (increasing ocean temperatures, decreasing oxygen availability, disease, loss of habitat, etc.) will likely compound the problem.\nThese effects are already being documented in many marine organisms, particularly in tropical and deep-sea corals, which exhibit slower calcification rates under more acidic conditions. The impact on corals is of great concern because they produce massive calcium carbonate structures called reefs that provide habitat for many marine animals, including commercially important fish and shellfish species that use the reefs as nursery grounds. Coral reefs are vital to humans as sources of food and medicine, protection from storms, and the focus of eco-tourism. In addition to corals, studies have shown that acidification impairs the ability of some calcifying plankton, tiny floating plants and animals at the base of the food web, to build and maintain their shells. Scientists have also observed increased larval mortality rates of several commercially important fish and shellfish.\nWhat can we expect in the future?\nOcean acidification is occurring at a rate 30 to100 times faster than at any time during the last several million years driven by the rapid growth rate atmospheric CO2 that is almost unprecedented over geologic history. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), economic and population scenarios predict that atmospheric CO2 levels could reach 500 ppm by 2050 and 800 ppm or more by the end of the century. This will not only lead to significant temperature increases in the atmosphere and ocean, but will further acidify ocean water, reducing the pH an estimated 0.3 to 0.4 units by 2100, a 150 percent increase in acidity over preindustrial times. Assuming a “business-as-usual” IPCC CO2 emission scenario, predictive models of ocean biogeochemistry project that surface waters of the Arctic and Southern Oceans will become undersaturated with aragonite (a more soluble form of calcium carbonate) within a few decades, meaning that these waters will become highly corrosive to the shells and skeletons of aragonite-producing marine calcifiers like planktonic marine snails known as pteropods.\nAlthough ocean acidification has only recently emerged as a scientific issue, it has quickly raised serious concerns about the short-term impacts on marine organisms and the long-term health of the ocean. Scientists estimate that over the next few thousand years, 90 percent of anthropogenic CO2 emissions will be absorbed by the ocean. This may potentially affect biological and geochemical processes such as photosynthesis and nutrient cycling that are vital to marine ecosystems on which human society and many natural systems rely. At the same time, marine organisms will face the enormous challenge of adapting to ocean acidification, warming water, and declining subsurface-ocean oxygen concentrations.\nNews & Insights\nWHOI working to address ocean acidification; protect region’s vital shellfish industry\nA new report addresses the impacts of ocean acidification in Massachusetts and New England coastal waters on the region’s vital seafood industry.\nOcean acidification gets a watchful eye in New England aquaculture ‘hot spot’\nShellfish aquaculture is thriving in New England, but future growth in the industry could be stunted as coastal waters in the region become more acidic.

{"question":"Which material required more complex manufacturing process: medieval paper or vellum?","answer":"Medieval paper required a more complex manufacturing process. Paper making involved multiple steps: sorting and washing linen rags, letting them ferment, beating them repeatedly in water over several weeks until they became pulp, creating sheets using wire frames and felt layers, pressing to remove water, drying, treating with animal glue for sizing, and sometimes polishing with smooth stone. In contrast, vellum production was simpler: the calf skins were soaked in lime, stretched on frames, scraped with a moon-shaped knife to create uniform thickness, and then bleached to achieve the desired color.","context":["|1. thin||6. bleached/whitened|\n|2. court documents||7. dialect|\n|3. high-quality||8. baseline|\n|4. buried||9. evolution|\n|5. thickness||10. trade routes|\nYou will hear a historian giving a presentation about techniques to identify the origin of handwritten books from the middle ages.\nHistorian: My presentation today is on how the science of genetics is being used to shed light on the origin of manuscripts - anything written by hand - produced in the medieval period ... that is ... the period between the fifth and fifteenth centuries AD.\nAs many of you know, thousands of medieval handwritten books still exist today. Some of them have a clear provenance, that is, we know exactly where and when they were written, but the origin of many manuscripts has been a complete mystery, that is, until two thousand and nine when geneticists started using DNA testing to shed light on their origins.\nBut before looking at the new research, I need to explain something about the way the manuscripts were produced - particularly what they were written on. Virtually all were written on treated animal skins and there were essentially two types. The first was parchment, which is made of sheep skin. It has the quality of being very white but also being thin. It has a naturally greasy surface which meant it was hard to erase writing from it. This made it much sought after for court documents in medieval times.\nThe second type is vellum, which is calf skin. This was most often used for any very ‘high- status’ documents because it provided the best writing surface so scribes could achieve lettering of high quality.\nSo, once the animal hides had been chosen, they had to be prepared. Where the right materials were on hand, the skins were put into large barrels or vats of lime, where they were agitated or stirred frequently. But if lime wasn’t available, then the hides were buried. Both these techniques were designed to cause the hair to slough off, and the skins to become gelatinous and therefore more flexible.\nThe next stage was to put the hides on stretcher frames and pull them very tight. While on the frame they were scraped with a moon-shaped knife in order to create a uniform thickness. For parchment, that was the end of the process, but for vellum there was an additional stage where it was bleached, in order to achieve the desired colour.\nHistorian: So, what does all this preparation mean for the quest to identify the origins of ‘mystery’ manuscripts? Well, until recently the only way historians and other academics were able to guess at origins was either through the analysis of the handwriting style, or from the dialect in which the piece was written. But these techniques have proven unreliable, for a number of reasons.\nIt was thus decided to try to look at the problem from a different angle ... to start from what is known, that is, the small number of manuscripts whose origins we do already know. Because these parchments and vellum are both made from animal hides, it was possible to subject them to DNA testing and to identify the genetic markers for the date and location of production. From this was created what is known as a ‘baseline’. The next stage was to test the mystery manuscripts, finding their DNA characteristics and then making comparisons between the known and the mystery scripts. Genetic similarities and differences enabled the scientists to gain more information about the origins of the many manuscripts we had known virtually nothing about up to that point.\nNow you might ask - what are the potential uses of this new information? Well, obviously, it can shed light on the origin of individual books and manuscripts. But that’s not all. It can also shed light on the evolution of the whole of the manuscripts production industry in medieval times. And because that was such a thriving business, involving very large-scale movements right across the globe, the new data, in turn, help historians establish which trade routes were in operation during the whole millennium.\nNow if anyone has any questions ...","Medieval lords had castle accounts, right? On what were these written? Did they call them paper, or parchment? Were they made of dried skins, linen, paper?\nAccount books could have been made of paper, which was viewed as less sturdy than parchment and thus for less important matters. “There are indeed very many medieval manuscripts written on paper. Cheap little books made for clerics and students were probably more often on paper than on parchment by the fifteenth century. Even major aristocratic libraries had manuscripts on paper. Some paper manuscripts survive with the inner and outer pairs of leaves in each gatherings made of parchment, presumably because parchment is stronger and these were the most vulnerable pages. Paper was a Chinese invention probably of the second century and the technique of paper-making spent a thousand years slowly working its way through the Arab world to the West. By the thirteenth century there were established paper mills in Spain and Italy, and in France by about 1340, Germany by 1390, but probably not in England until the later fifteenth century. Paper was exported from its place of manufacture into all parts of Europe . . .\nMedieval paper was made from linen rags. It is much stronger and more durable than modern wood-pulp paper, and fifteenth-century scribes were wrong if they believed that it would not survive. Rag paper is manufactured as follows. White rags are sorted and washed thoroughly in a tub pierced with drainage holes and they are then allowed to ferment for four or five days. Then the wet disintegrating pieces are cut into scraps and beaten for some hours in clean running water, left to fester for a week, beaten again, and so on, several times over, until the mixture disintegrates into a runny water-logged pulp. It is then tipped into a huge vat. A wire frame is scooped into the vat, picking up a film of wet fibres, and it is shaken free of drips and emptied onto a sheet of felt. Another layer of felt is laid over it. As the soggy sheets emerge and are tipped out, they are stacked in a pile of multiple sandwiches of interleaved felt and paper. Then the stack is squeezed in a press to remove excess water and the damp paper can be taken out and hung up to dry. When ready, the sheet is ‘sized’ by lowering it into an animal glue made from boiling scraps of vellum or other offcuts. The size makes the paper less absorbent and allows it to take ink without running. The sheets may have to be pressed again to make them completely flat. Sometimes, especially in north-east Italy (doubtless under the influence of Islamic paper manufacture) the paper was polished with a smooth stone to give it a luxurious sheen.” http://linux2.hit.uib.no/non/echt/budapest/ManMan/paper.html\nPaper was used in Wales, certainly. A surviving manuscript (from the thirteenth century) is in the National Library of Wales. It was a ‘pocket’ book of the laws of Hywel Dda (from the 10th century), designed for lawyers to carry around in their scrip, rather than left on a library shelf.\nYou can view it here: http://digidol.llgc.org.uk/METS/lhw00003/physical\nOn the other hand, parchment was something different, and also used, though it was a more precious substance than paper. It was: “a writing support material that derives its name from Pergamon (Bergama in modern Turkey), an early production centre. The term is often used generically to denote animal skin prepared to receive writing, although it is more correctly applied only to sheep and goat skin, with the term vellum reserved for calf skin. Uterine vellum, the skin of stillborn or very young calves, is characterised by its small size and particularly fine, white appearance; however, it was rarely used. To produce parchment or vellum, the animal skins were defleshed in a bath of lime, stretched on a frame, and scraped with a lunellum while damp. They could then be treated with pumice, whitened with a substance such as chalk, and cut to size. Differences in preparation technique seem to have occasioned greater diversity in appearance than did the type of skin used. Parchment supplanted papyrus as the most popular writing support material in the fourth century, although it was known earlier. Parchment was itself largely replaced by paper in the sixteenth century (with the rise of printing), but remained in use for certain high-grade books. See also flesh side and hair side.” http://linux2.hit.uib.no/non/echt/budapest/ManMan/glossary.html#parchment\nIlluminated manuscripts of whatever nature were exclusively on parchment until the late Middle Ages: “The majority of surviving manuscripts are from the Middle Ages, although many illuminated manuscripts survive from the Renaissance, along with a very limited number from Late Antiquity. The majority of these manuscripts are of a religious nature. However, especially from the 13th century onward, an increasing number of secular texts were illuminated. Most illuminated manuscripts were created as codices, which had superseded scrolls. A very few illuminated manuscript fragments survive on papyrus, which does not last nearly as long as vellum or parchment. Most medieval manuscripts, illuminated or not, were written on parchment (most commonly of calf, sheep, or goat skin), but most manuscripts important enough to illuminate were written on the best quality of parchment, called vellum.\nBeginning in the late Middle Ages manuscripts began to be produced on paper. Very early printed books were sometimes produced with spaces left for rubrics and miniatures, or were given illuminated initials, or decorations in the margin, but the introduction of printing rapidly led to the decline of illumination. Illuminated manuscripts continued to be produced in the early 16th century, but in much smaller numbers, mostly for the very wealthy."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0b6d93f8-54ac-43f9-835b-e3459f577a7d>","<urn:uuid:d39e0fd5-f7f1-4033-aaf2-d162469b0236>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which is more cost-effective for family travel: regular road trips by car or RV camping?","answer":"Regular road trips by car tend to be more cost-effective than RV camping. While road trips require expenses like fuel, accommodation, and car maintenance, RV travel involves significantly higher costs including the RV purchase ($10,000-$300,000), monthly maintenance (averaging $117), insurance, storage fees, and poor gas mileage. Even when using free camping sites, the total cost of RV ownership and operation often makes it a more expensive way to travel. Additionally, car travelers can reduce costs by bringing their own snacks and supplies from grocery stores rather than relying on service station prices, while RV owners must handle all maintenance and repairs of their 'tiny house on wheels'.","context":["Packing Your Car for the Perfect Road Trip\nThere is something particularly liberating about hitting the open road to seek adventure on a road trip. Although it may be quicker to jump on a plane and fly to your chosen destination, traveling by road often rewards you with a more authentic experience of a place where you get the chance to discover hidden gems not always listed in the guidebooks.\nHowever, as liberating as road trips are, they still require careful planning to ensure everything goes smoothly and that you return back home in one piece with lasting good memories. Take time to plan your routes carefully and book your accommodation in advance. This will allow you to avoid road closures, bad weather, and not being able to find a hotel room during peak travel periods.\nYou’ll of course want to have your car serviced to get it ready for the road, along with making sure your comprehensive car insurance coverage is adequate and up to date. The perfect time to research car insurance quotes online is just before a road trip to see if you’re currently paying too much or to purchase a policy with more coverage options like roadside assist or wind screen replacement that might come in handy during your travels.\nOnce your itinerary is drawn up and your car deemed fit to hit the open road, it’s then time to start packing. To help you make sure you pack all the essentials for your next road trip, we’ve compiled this list of must-have items that will make your trip much more comfortable and safer.\nGPS & Maps\nMany cars now come equipped with onboard GPS systems, but if yours lacks the technology, you can always bring a portable GPS unit. Alternatively, you can also use your smartphone and a travel app to help lead you on your journey. Your smartphone can also of course be used to call for help in an emergency and can be loaded up with hours of your favorite music which will come in handy when your preset radio stations drop out of range.\nIt’s important to remember that it is often illegal to operate a smartphone while driving, so invest in a hands-free kit with Bluetooth that will allow your attention to be focused on the road. It’s also a good idea to pack a paper map. You never know when your GPS may fail or when it may not be updated for your particular area. It’s also possible that your trusted travel app will fail due to a lack of signal in more remote areas.\nFirst Aid Kit\nA first aid kit is always a good idea to have in your car, especially if you are heading out on a road trip. Your car first aid kit should contain all the basics including bandages, gauze, pain medication, and burn ointment. A small pair of scissors and some medical tape are also great additions to your first aid kit.\nYou may also want to pack some aspirin since headaches are a common occurrence due to staying focused on the road for hours at a time. Bring a bottle of hand sanitizer to disinfect your hands after bathroom visits at rest stops or service stations. Soap and sometimes even water is not always provided in all public bathrooms, especially along remote stretches of road. And speaking of roadside bathrooms, you may find they sometimes even lack toilet paper, so having a few rolls packed in the car is always a smart idea.\nFood and Water\nIf you are on a budget, you may want to avoid going through the endless drive-thru windows for your meals on the road. Stop in to the grocery store before your trip and along the way to replenish your stash of dry goods at a fraction of what is charged at service stations or cafes. You may even want to carry a small cooler to help keep sandwiches and perishables last longer in the car.\nBringing your own snacks not only gives you healthier food options, but it is also important if you have certain food allergies you need to stay clear of. It may not always be easy to find gluten free snacks for example. Keep all your dry goods stored together in clear plastic tubs to make your snacks easier to find and clean.\nIf you are unlucky enough to have a car breakdown on the road you will want to have a reasonable supply of fresh water on board. For any road trip, it’s smart to pack a small case of bottled water that could last you at least a few days in an emergency. You may also want to pack a reusable water bottle you can refill at road stops and hotels. This will save you a bit of money and reduces waste. And speaking of waste, keep your car tidy by packing a small trash can or plastic bag to throw food wrappers and any garbage in so it doesn’t end up all over your car.\nYou don’t want your iPad or smartphone running out of juice on your trip. As discussed earlier, you can use your devices as navigation and simply for much needed entertainment. Make sure that you have all the right adaptors and chargers to keep all your devices charged up. You may even want to look into a solar powered charger if you plan on camping along the way. This will allow you to keep your devices running when not in your vehicle.\nVehicle Emergency Kit\nHopefully you won’t experience a vehicle breakdown, but you need to always be prepared for one just in case. This is especially true if you don’t have roadside assist. You should always have a spare tire, preferably a full-size one, and you should know how to change a tire yourself.\nYour vehicle emergency kit should contain booster cables in the event of a dead battery, light sticks, flashlight, reflective vest, warning triangle, tire pressure gauge, and maybe even a selection of spare important fuses and fluids.\nAs with any travel, having proper documents handy is always required. For road trips, this includes your driver’s license, vehicle registration, copy of your car insurance, and your roadside assist contact information if you have it. You may also need your passport and possibly visas if you plan on crossing any international borders or when taking a road trip abroad. You may even be required to obtain an International Driving Permit (IDP) when renting a car abroad for an international road trip.\nYou should also make sure your vehicle owner’s manual is in the glove box. You vehicle manual often provides helpful advice for when things aren’t operating properly, including how to make minor fixes, how to change a tire, and when it may be unsafe to continue driving your vehicle.\nWe hope these tips allow you to experience a stress-free road trip. When done properly, road trips are some of the most memorable trips a traveler can embark on.","Are you on the fence about buying an RV? That can be a good thing. Purchasing a recreational vehicle is a serious investment, so you should consider the potential downsides before making your purchase. Plus, we have experienced RV owners and travelers sharing their buying advice.\nPotential reasons to not buy an RV\nFirst of all, we aren’t saying RVs are bad. Recreational vehicles, motorhomes, campers, and more provide a wonderful way to travel across the country. But they aren’t for everyone, so if you’re on the fence, this information could help you make a final decision.\nAs Sonda Rochelle from Axles Addict shares, even under the appropriate circumstances, people should be prepared because problems can be more common than most people realize. You don’t want to end up as part of an RV horror story.\n1. RVs could be more expensive than expected\nRVs can cost between $10,000 to $300,000 depending on different styles and features. A moderately equipped camper that’s pulled behind a truck may only cost $20,000, and a fifth-wheel could be around $40,000. Also, you need a truck or SUV with enough power to pull it. Motorhome prices usually start around $100,000, according to the Camper Report.\nDepending on how you finance your RV, it could generate a high-interest rate. According to RV Guide, if you borrow $30,000 to purchase an RV with a 5 percent interest rate over five years, then you’ll have nearly $4,000 in interest costs over the lifespan of the loan.\nAfter you buy your RV, you have to pay to maintain the coach. Otherwise, it may quickly deteriorate and lose its value. The average cost of maintenance for RVs on a monthly basis due to upkeep and repairs is about $117 per month.\nRosanna T. Mitchell, the creator of A Pragmatic Lens shared, “We love having our camper, and it has been a life-saver this year with all the pandemic woes. That being said, there are two main things that potential buyers should know about.\n- RV ownership is not carefree. You are basically responsible for the maintenance of another tiny house. This is not only in relation to regular maintenance and damage repair, but also you will need to study and become acquainted with the ins-and-outs of your rig and be ready to troubleshoot on the spot. It is a learning curve, for sure.\n- It may not be as cost effective as expected. Most people would imagine that owning an RV will save money because airfare would not be an issue. Yet, even when camping in free sites, after adding up the purchasing costs, insurance, gas mileage, RV maintenance, repairs, and storage, it may actually result in a fairly expensive way to travel.\nAll in all, we don’t actually see RV travel as particularly convenient or cheap. There are far more convenient ways to explore, such as staying in furnished state park cabins, for example.\nSo why do we do it? Well, it is all about the experience and the memories we make in our tiny home on wheels.”\n2. RV travel is dangerous\nTruck drivers have to become officially trained and certified before they get behind the wheel of a semi. However, RV drivers can get in and just go. But driving or hauling a recreational vehicle is dangerous.\nThe extra weight and longer length of trailers can require a longer stopping time. You could face blind spots that block smaller vehicles from your vision. Driving is also exhausting, and driving tired is the equivalent of driving drunk.\nYou might have to park your RV in a crowded campground with children and other obstacles to avoid. Plus, you may face inclement weather and traffic jams.\nWhile we’re covering dangerous situations, it’s a good time to mention that allowing your children to freely move about your RV while in motion is illegal.\nAccidents may also occur while the RV is parked. People can trip out of the high entry points, items may shift during transit and fall when opening storage cabinets, RVs can catch fire, and more.\n3. RVs can be labor intensive\nYour work isn’t done when you buy a recreational vehicle. You have to maintain it and plan out your trips. You can’t just wing vacations and park anywhere. Plan a route ahead of time and secure parking spots. This way, you won’t be stuck searching for a place to pull over and sleep safely.\nPacking up your RV and preparing for trips can be a lot of work. Will you need snow gear? Do you need food? Does your dog need its crate? Do you have enough bedding to keep people warm?\nAre you prepared with a first aid kit? Some campgrounds are in remote areas that may not have instant access to what you need. On that note, they may be far away from medical facilities as well.\nPlus, the cleanup. Recreational vehicles make it easy to track in mud. Plus, it’s easy to spill food and drinks. You may need to sweep and wipe down counters daily.\nRemember that rodents may want to make their home in your RV, so set up deterrents. You may want to wash all the bedding at home and figure out how to get rid of musty smells after camping.\nAlso, you need to dump your family’s poop at the end of the trip. So, that might not smell pretty or go exactly as planned. It’s not like a hotel, where everything is taken care of for you. But if you can handle the hard work and potential risks, then your RV will be very rewarding."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:28e78760-037f-42e2-9d13-373129ce633e>","<urn:uuid:fb48863e-9457-4fe5-8ae0-ce69f05c201f>"],"error":null}

{"question":"What role does amplitude play in ultrasonic welding, and what quality standards govern weld inspections?","answer":"Amplitude is the dominant parameter in ultrasonic welding, having significantly greater impact than other parameters. It represents the peak-to-peak movement of the horn, and when coupled with force, creates waves of energy that move through the part. These waves generate heat through intermolecular and surface friction at the joint interface. Each material has a specific amplitude range for optimal welding results - for example, Polycarbonate requires 60-100 microns. As for quality standards, several organizations govern weld inspections, including AWS, ASME, CSA, and ISO. Common standards include AWS D1.1 for structural welding, ASME B31.3 for process piping, and ISO 5817 for fusion welding joints. These standards provide detailed acceptance criteria for weld quality inspection.","context":["by Jeffrey Frantz, Branson Ultrasonics Corp.\nUltrasonic welding is a technology that has been used for decades to assemble plastic components. There are many benefits of this technology. It allows for plastic parts to be assembled without consumables. This not only eliminates the cost of the consumable (such as screws or rivets), but in the case of adhesives and solvents, eliminates the set-up or cure time, which dramatically improves throughput. It is an extremely fast technology as most welds occur in less than a second. It easily can be integrated into semi- or fully automated systems, and it also is a very cost-competitive process. With all of these benefits, it is easy to understand why ultrasonic welding often is the first choice for plastic joining needs.\nLets begin with a brief description of the process. The ultrasonic vibrations are created by a series of components – power supply, converter, booster, horn and actuator – to deliver mechanical vibration and force to the parts. This generates heat at the interface of the parts to be joined, melting the plastic and creating a strong bond.\nFigure 1 shows how the power supply, converter, booster and horn function together to create mechanical vibration. The power supply takes standard electrical line voltage and converts it to an operating frequency (in this illustration, 20kHz). Power supply frequencies are set, but are available between 15 – 70kHz. The most common frequencies are 20, 30 and 40kHz. This electrical energy is sent through an RF cable to the converter. The converter utilizes piezoelectric ceramics to convert the electrical energy to mechanical vibrations at the operating frequency of the power supply. This mechanical vibration either is increased or decreased based on the configuration of the booster and horn. The proper mechanical vibration, known as amplitude, typically is determined by an applications engineer and based on the materials being welded.\nMechanical vibrations are delivered to the parts to be welded. The parts also are put under a mechanical load, primarily through a pneumatic actuator. Under this load, the mechanical vibrations are transmitted to the interface between the parts. In most cases, there is a triangular-shaped bead, known as an energy director, designed into this interface. This creates a point for the vibration to be focused, resulting in intermolecular and surface friction. This friction creates heat and a subsequent melt.\nThe main parameters in an ultrasonic weld can be derived through the fundamental equation shown in Figure 2.\nAmplitude is the dominate parameter and has a significantly greater impact on the weld than the other parameters. Amplitude is the peak-to-peak movement of the horn. This motion, coupled with force being generated by pressure and downspeed, creates a condition where the amplitude produces waves of energy that move through the part contacted by the horn. These mechanical waves of energy create stress at the joint interface in the form of intermolecular and surface friction. This creates heat that propagates from the point of contact between the parts to the entire joint area. Once the ultrasonic energy is stopped, the joint cools and solidifies to form a weld. All of this takes place, in most cases, in less than 500 milliseconds.\nThe weld process can be broken down into some very basic sections. It is important to distinguish them and make sure they are individually controlled. First is the approach to the part. This is the distance between the home position and the part. Next is the point of contact to the part. This is known as trigger. The weld duration is next, followed by hold.\nLet’s start with the approach to the part. This distance most often is predicated by having enough space to load and unload the part in manual operations and minimal distances in automation. This typically is controlled through the downspeed setting, which regulates through a flow meter on the output side of the air cylinder. It is important to note that this setting not only controls the velocity of the horn to the part, but also the buildup of force during the weld.\nThere are many ways to control the ultrasonic weld. This most often is done through a controller that comes with the welder. In its most basic form, the weld is controlled by time. Time generally is set in milliseconds. The next level of control is energy. This is done through a watt meter that calculates the watts per second, known as joules. The illustration in Figure 3 demonstrates a typical power graph that illustrates these two weld modes. As seen in the energy mode, the weld time will vary slightly due to minor variations in part-to-part tolerances. Energy mode is used in some applications where there are multi-cavity combinations being welded.\nThe original energy setting was based on the center power profile. The area under the curve is the weld energy. The surrounding graphs show power curves that have a slightly different power draw. The weld time fluctuates to meet the weld energy set in the controller.\nIn more sophisticated units, a linear encoder is attached to the actuator. In most cases, it has a resolution of 0.0001″, which allows for many different functions to be utilized and controlled. In the approach to the part, the point (in distance) that a pre-trigger will initiate the ultrasonics can be precisely set. A pre-trigger often is used in shear joint, staking and insertion applications to turn the ultrasonics on prior to the horn contacting the part. This prevents the parts from being pressed together. In an actuator without distance capability, the pre-trigger would be turned on as soon as the horn leaves its home position, which can create excessive noise, horn failures and inconsistent weld results.\nThe linear encoder also is used to provide two additional modes of weld control: Collapse and Absolute. Collapse is a controlled measurement between the point of contact and the part. For instance, if a part has an energy director joint design that is 0.015″ high, the Collapse could be set to that exact amount. The welder would reset the linear encoder readings once the horn contacts the part, and then moves the 0.015″ set in Collapse and then turns off the ultrasonics. Absolute is a control mode that sets the distance the actuator will travel. It is used when the part requirement is to maintain an overall height dimension.\nThere also is a Peak Power capability which will turn off ultrasonics when a peak power point is reached. This mode is not often used, but can be a benefit in plunge welding of textiles. Due to the openness of the materials, they go through a rapid transition once molten. This results in a quick spike in power consumption. Peak Power mode prevents what is known as “blow though”, where the weld flash melts through the surrounding area.\nOften overlooked in a weld sequence is the trigger point. This is the point in the process where the actuator has made contact with the part, the cycle is initiated and the processing mentioned above takes place. In most weld systems, a mechanical trigger is used. This is adequate, but for more precise control a load cell that measures force provides a higher level of control.\nLet’s now look at the set up of the welder. As mentioned earlier, amplitude is the most important parameter for successful welding. The amplitude is created by the gain ratios of the stack, which encompasses the converter, booster and horn. The converter has a fixed ratio determined by the manufacturer. For this example, we will work in 20kHz which has an output of 20microns. The booster and horn gains are determined individually by the mass ratio of their input to output masses. Figure 4 shows a 1:1 booster and a 1:2 gain booster. The horn design is determined by the horn it is to contact. It should be designed to contact over the area to be welded. Based on size, frequency and material limitations, gain may or may not be incorporated. When these three components are attached, they create what is known as stack amplitude.\nIt is imperative to have the proper stack amplitude to match the material being welded. Each material has a range of amplitude for ideal weld results. For instance, Polycarbonate has an amplitude range of 60-100microns. It will weld with amplitudes outside of this range, but should be well within the range for optimum results. The supplier of the horn should provide horn gain information so the user can calculate which booster is best for the material.\nOnce the stack components have been selected, properly torqued and installed in the actuator, the next setting is weld pressure. In most cases, a setting between 30 and 50psi is adequate. Naturally, lower pressures should be used for smaller thinner walled parts, with high pressures used for larger parts with thicker walls. The next setting is downspeed or velocity. This determines the rates of descent of the horn to the part, but ultimately it determines the rate of force build up during the weld. Most weld setups utilize a setting between 1.5 -2.5 in./sec.\nThe next parameter to set is weld mode and duration. With all of the weld modes available, where do you start? Many of us utilize our past experiences to select a weld mode that worked previously. This may or may not be successful. Ideally, you should always start in the time mode. The other modes do have benefits, but also can mask some potential issues or restrict the process from behaving naturally. The best practice is to use the time mode and let the parts tell you what is best for them. Let me explain.\nYou will need to run some trials and use your judgment in refining the weld settings until you get an acceptable part. Once you have achieved an acceptable part that passes all of your test criteria, you should set up a DOE (Design of Experiments) to determine the optimum settings for amplitude, pressure and downspeed. This will lead to your ideal settings. From there you can begin work on selecting the optimum weld mode. To do this, you will need to weld a grouping of parts (quantity to be determined, but usually no less than 50) and the tools to collect weld data. The more cavity combinations incorporated in this analysis, the more accurate the findings. It is imperative that you weld and label the parts to correspond with the weld data. At a minimum, the weld data should include energy, peak power, collapse and absolute.\nThe next step is to inspect and test the parts. Look them over visually and then put them through whatever tests are applicable. There most likely will be a few of these parts that fall outside of acceptable ranges. Compare those parts with the weld data. There will no doubt be some variation in the data. It may be in energy or collapse or absolute, but there will be variation. Compare the data between the good and bad parts, and let the data indicate the mode with the most consistency. Change the weld mode and run the experiment again. Results will improve.\nOnce the weld mode has been optimized, you then can move to the next step, which is amplitude control. You already have determined the stack amplitude with the converter, booster and horn, but the amplitude also can be changed electronically during the weld. This is known as amplitude profiling. The principle behind this technique is to use a high level of amplitude in the early stages of the weld to bring the material to its molten or softened state. Once heated, it no longer requires that high level of amplitude. To increase control of the melt, decrease the amplitude setting at some point midway through the cycle. In many cases, a decrease from 100 percent to 70-50 percent will provide another level of weld consistency. Another DOE on the amplitude profile settings is recommended.\nIt seems like this process is quite extensive and may take a good deal of time to complete, but in reality it is time well spent in the early stages of product and process development. Time spent here will pay huge dividends when full scale production begins. Throughput will be higher and the time spent tweaking the process on the floor will be minimized.\nJeff Frantz is director of marketing and product development and has been employed at Branson Ultrasonics for 35 years.

Hence, the most important factor for weld quality inspection is the acceptance criteria.\nThe acceptance criteria will vary depending on the application (Structure welding or pressure vessel or piping, for example) and the governing code or standard. Other factors to consider when performing a visual inspection of welds include: Welding process, base material, filler material, and joint design.\nWhen checking welds for acceptability, the Welding Inspector must have a clear understanding of the acceptance criteria. If the acceptance criteria are not met, then the weld must be rejected. The most common reason for rejection is the presence of Welding Defects such as welding Crack, Lack of Fusion, porosity, slag inclusion, incomplete root penetration, and excessive reinforcement, etc.\nWhat is Visual Inspection in Welding?\nVisual Inspection is a process of examining welds to evaluate their quality & acceptance according to acceptance criteria, and is an important part of welding quality control.\nIn general, visual inspection of weld includes an examination of the weld bead profile, width and penetration (where applicable), as well as any defects that may be present in the welding and Heat Affected Zone (HAZ).\nWelds are also checked for proper alignment, dimensions as per drawing and spacing at three stages:\n- Before Welding: inspection of base metal, welding electrodes & equipment’s, review drawings.\n- During Welding: in process welding inspection to validate compliance of welding procedures, check weld root and preheat & interpass temperature.\n- After Welding: Final weld visual inspection.\nIf any welding defects are found during visual inspection, they required to be repaired before finally accepting the welded part by the welding inspector. This will help to ensure that the final product meets all the required welding quality standards.\nWeld Quality Standards\nWeld quality standards are set by various organizations including the American Welding Society (AWS), the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME), Canadian Standards Association (CSA) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).\nThe AWS D1.1 standard is widely used in the construction industry in the USA and around the world, while the ASME B31.3 standard is commonly used in the piping jobs for petrochemical and oil & gas industries. The ISO 5817 standard is used in a variety of industries, such as welded parts, shipbuilding and offshore construction.\nThe ASME Section IX welding code is another important welding quality standard. It provides requirements for welders and welding procedures, as well as nondestructive testing methods. These standards help ensure that welds are properly made and meet the required strength and integrity levels.\nA summary of Welding Quality Standards are:\n- AWS D1.1: Structural Welding Code- Steel\n- ASME B31.3: Process Piping Code\n- ASME Section IX: Welding and Brazing Qualifications Code\n- API 1104: Welding of Pipelines\n- ASME Section VIII: Pressure vessel construction rule\n- CSA W59: Welded Steel Construction\n- CSA W59.2: Welded Aluminum Construction\n- CSA W186: Welding of Rebar\n- BS EN ISO 5817: Fusion welding joints in steel, nickel, aluminum: Quality Level of Imperfections\n- DIN EN ISO 6520-2: classification if geometric imperfections in metallic materials welding with pressure\n- ISO 6520-1: Geometrical imperfections in metallic materials: Fusion Welding\n- ISO 10042: Welding – Arc-welded joints in aluminum and its alloys – Quality levels for imperfections\n- ISO 17637: Non- destructive testing of welds – Visual testing of Fusion welded joints\n- AWS B1.11: Guide for Visual Inspection of Welds\nWelding Visual Inspection Standard\nWelding is a critical process in the fabrication of metal structures and components. The quality of the welds is essential to the safety and integrity of the finished product. Below are the main Welding Visual Inspection Standards and Code with respective reference for Acceptance Criteria:\n- AWS D1.1: Visual Inspection acceptance criteria given in Table 8.1, page 239 in 2020 Ed.\n- ASME B31.3: Visual Inspection Acceptance Criteria for Welds is given in Table 341.3.2.\n- API 1104: Acceptance criteria given in Clause 8: Inspection & Testing of Welds.\n- ISO 5817: Acceptance criteria given in Table 1 for all type of welding defects.\n- ASME Section IX: Acceptance criteria given in clause QW:194.\nThe welding visual inspection standard that is most commonly used in the United States is AWS D1.1. This standard covers the requirements for welding steel structures, such as bridges and buildings. It includes specifications for joint design, welding processes, welding consumables, and inspection methods.\nASME B31.3 is another widely used welding visual inspection standard. It covers the requirements for piping systems that are used in petroleum refineries, chemical plants, and other industrial facilities.\nWelding Visual Inspection Acceptance Criteria\nTo ensure the quality of a welding procedure, final weld need to meet the Acceptance Criteria defined in the applicable code or standard during the welding inspection by Welding Inspectors. These weld visual inspection criteria is based on:\n- Inspection & verify the weld size (throat size or Leg Size or fillet weld) and dimensions.\n- Acceptable weld bead profile having good workmanship.\n- Weld free from welding defects or within the limit as per acceptance criteria.\n- Verify dimensional accuracy of weld.\nIf any of these criteria are not met, it may result in a weld that is not strong enough and could fail during service or just after welding. This could lead to serious consequences, such as personal injury or damage to equipment & financial losses. That is why it is so important to have well-defined Acceptance Criteria for welding visual inspection.\nVisual Weld Inspection Acceptance Criteria AWS d1.1\nWeld visual inspection criteria is given in AWS D1.1 Clause 8: Inspection. Table 8.1 covers the welding acceptance criteria for cracks, lack of weld fusion, weld profile, undercut, porosity and undersize welds. An abstract of AWS D1.1 Table 8.1 & 101.15 (for Tubular connections) is given below for reference.\nVisual Weld Inspection Acceptance Criteria ASME B31.3\nIn ASME B31.2, acceptance criteria for weld visual inspection is given for cracks, lack of fusion, porosity, undercut, surface finish, incomplete penetration, etc. in Table 431.3.2 given below for reference.\nBased on the service conditions, weld defect acceptance is categorized from ‘A to M’ in Table 341.3.2, page 2 with their acceptable limit values.\nVisual Weld Inspection Acceptance Criteria ASME Section IX\nWeld visual inspection criteria for welder qualification and procedure qualification is defined in ASME Section IX- QW194. According to QW 194, the weld shall be free from cracks, lack of weld fusion and show complete joint penetration.\nThe welding visual quality level given in ASME Section IX is not detailed like AWS D1.1 or ASME B31.3 or ISO 5817 but instead a general conditions stated.\nWeld Visual Inspection Checklist\nA weld visual inspection checklist is a document used by inspectors to ensure that all welding meets the required standards. The checklist includes a list of all the welding requirements and specifications that need to be met.\nYou can download sample weld visual inspection checklist from this link.\nWeld Visual Inspection Procedure\nPreparing the weld surface area for inspection is important because it allows the inspector to get a clear view of the weld. The first step is to remove any debris or contaminants that might be present and can hamper the clear view of welding area.\nNext, the inspector will use a measuring device to take accurate measurements of the weld. Finally, the inspector will take photographs of the weld area from different angles.\nPerforming the actual inspection is crucial to ensuring that the weld meets all quality standards. The inspector will closely examine the weld for any defects such as cracks, porosity, or incomplete fusion.\nRelated reading: How to Use Fillet Weld Gauges?\nA weld visual inspection is conducted to ensure that the welds made meet the required standards. The inspector will look for any defects on the surface of the weld or in the structure of the weld itself. There are three main steps in a weld visual inspection:\n- The first step is to review and get familiar with the welding drawing, acceptance criteria and know what type of welding check will be applicable & what inspection coverage is required.\n- Ensure all inspection tools are in good condition and calibrated.\n- Check the surface of the weld for any defects using right visible light intensity (recommended minimum 550Lux as per ISO 17637). This includes looking for cracks, porosity, or other flaws.\n- Check the structure of the weld itself. Look for any material or other structural defects.\n- Next, check for dimensional accuracy. This includes checking that the dimensions of the weld meet the requirements specified in the drawings or specifications.\n- Record all observations and any non-compliance shall be reported via visual inspection report.\nTips for Successful Professional Inspections\nBefore getting started on your inspection assignment reflect on the following:\n• Tools required (gauges, tape, ruler, magnifying glass, etc.)\n• Job specifications, standards, drawings, inspection/testing plan.\n• Information on the working environment safety issues, history of the company’s past performance and its cooperation; communication channel and people involved.\n- Your expectations for this inspection assignment.\n- Should any disagreements or arguments occur regarding your findings, how are you going to conduct yourself?\n- As a professional you should have a debriefing session with those concerned before your departure, and you should leave on professional and positive terms.\nHow to Check Weld Visual Inspection?\nWhen it comes to weld visual inspection, there are a few key things you need to keep in mind. First and foremost, you need to make sure that you have the right tools for the job.\nFollow the steps covered under Weld Visual Inspection Procedure.\nWeld Visual Inspection Report Format and Sample\nA weld Visual report format is important part of weld quality documentation. A complete weld visual inspection report should contain:\n- Job details- Name, Number\n- Acceptance code/ standard/ specification\n- Light intensity\n- surface conditions\n- Stage of welding inspection\n- Material details\n- Sketch if required.\n- Signed by welding inspector & date of report\nWelding Defects Visual Inspection\nThere are several different types of welding defects that can be identified during a visual inspection. These defects include incomplete fusion, porosity, cracking, and slag inclusion. Incomplete fusion occurs when the weld metal does not properly adhere to the base metal. Porosity is caused by gas pockets that are present in the weld metal.\nRelated Reading: Welding Undercut- causes & Remedies\nCracking can occur in the weld metal or heat-affected zone due to thermal stress or impurities in the base metal.

{"question":"I'm interested in the intersection of aviation and environmental impact. What does aviation archaeology study about aircraft crash sites, and how do these sites affect migratory birds in the area?","answer":"Aviation archaeology studies the connection between land and sky by examining how aviation experiments have impacted the landscape, particularly focusing on aircraft crash sites. In areas like the Mojave Desert, there are over 600 crash sites from experimental aircraft testing, which despite being cleaned up still contain plane fragments dissolving into the ground. These sites represent physical evidence of aviation history and human impact on the terrain. Regarding migratory birds, these crash sites and their associated infrastructure can harm birds' natural patterns since they're not accustomed to pathway obstructions. To protect birds in such areas, specific measures are required, including conducting pre-construction surveys within 500 feet of sites, marking wires with flight diverters, and following special provisions during nesting season from May 1st to September 15th.","context":["Center for Land Use Interpretation\nAs you’ve likely heard, a meteor landed on Earth last Friday. As I write this, people in Russia and Kazakhstan are dealing with the bizarre aftermath of this otherworldly event, a stark reminder of the fragility of the planet we live on. For decades to come, Russian and Kazak kids will perhaps revel in hunting for meteorites, relics of this disturbing albeit natural incident.\nIt is only natural for human beings to take an interest in collecting tokens of matter that have fallen from the sky, real and tangible pieces of natural history. However, what happens when our fragile planet is marked not only by out of orbit incidences, but by what we do to our planet ourselves? What about the relics that get left behind from our experiments? And not only what happens with them, but what can they teach us about the past and about where we’re headed?\nEnter the field of Aviation Archaeology, a fascinating emerging field of study exploring the connection between land and sky, and how aviation experiments from the past have impacted and been documented in the planet’s landscape. The Center for Land Use Interpretation (CLUI), a self-ascribed “research organization involved in exploring, examining, and understanding land and landscape issues”, is making a public display of Aviation Archaeology’s findings in their most recent exhibition, Down to Earth: Experimental Aircraft Crash Sites of the Mojave, taking place in Los Angeles, CA.\nCLUI is a champion of questioning and documenting the United States’ terrain. They look at the landscape of the country and dissect it. They take forgotten fields and locations and make them known. They investigate the bizarre places that we, as humans, have altered, and make them part of the American landscape. They are creating a map for the seen and unseen oddities of this transforming planet, a map of human impact on Earth, in our country.\nCLUI’s mission and how they execute it is nothing short of a wonder. Their website’s incredibly interactive Land Use Database is just one example of how they effectively educate the public of their work in ways that are at once creative, engaging and historical. Supporting them felt so important to us because we had never heard of anything like it. They’ve taken on the arduous task of being archivists in ways that few others are. They are also the point at which independent historians and archeologists (like Peter W. Merlin, described below) can converge to share their unique work. As we continue to need to ask the questions about what we’re doing to our planet, why we are doing it, and what the consequences will be, CLUI is helping us find these vital and obscure answers.\nBelow, Matthew Coolidge (Director, CLUI) writes about the Down to Earth exhibit, and teaches us why Aviation Archaeology is an important field to pay attention to.\nDown to Earth: Thoughts on Airplane Crash Sites and Aviation Archeologists\nby Matthew Coolidge, Director of the Center for Land Use Interpretation\nThe Center for Land Use Interpretation addresses a wide range of topics. Since all human activity plays out on (or over, or under) the ground, everything humans do can be considered from a “land use” perspective, if you consider the term very literally, as we do. From this infinity of possibilities, we select themes to explore through our programming based on a number of criteria, some objective, some maybe less so, but always because they seem relevant to the conditions and times we are in, as a society, today. They often deal with the technologies of the modern world that sustain our way of life, and examine their effects on the land, culture, and collective psyche, hopefully revealing new perspectives and notions about things we take for granted, or do not think about much at all.\nAerospace, and the “sky/land” interface, is one of a few dozen recurring subjects for us, since its direct and indirect impacts are one of the dominant features of contemporary life in a global world. It’s a technology that can seem abstract and esoteric, so we often try to bring it “down to earth,” as they say, to address it by finding actual, physical places, which can be visited, that can be “ground truthed,” to tell the story. And we try and find new and unusual ways in to a subject, often by finding experts in the field who are driven more by passion, then by economics.\nA good example is a new exhibit we just opened at our space in Los Angeles, about experimental aircraft crash sites in the Mojave Desert. The exhibit depicts and describes eleven incidents, selected to represent the range of advanced technology over 70 years of jet-powered flight, from a 1948 crash of a “flying wing” to a 2009 crash of an advanced fighter plane, now part of the US Air Forces. The show is about technology, but more about the poetic implications of these “high impact” land use sites, arbitrary drop points from above, that happened, literally, by accident. And why some people find them interesting enough to devote much of their free time to seeking them out, an activity known broadly as “wreck-finding,” and more officially, now, as “aviation archeology.”\nSince the “Right Stuff”- era, Edwards Air Force Base, north of Los Angeles, has been the principal place for testing experimental aircraft. As a result, the landscape around it is peppered with crash sites – more than 600 in the western Mojave Desert alone. While many of them occurred inside restricted military spaces, many more occurred on private and public land outside the reservations. Some crashes occurred next to homes, and state highways. Sometimes the pilot ejected safely, sometimes not. These are complicated and often tragic places. In all cases though, despite having been cleaned up by authorities immediately following the crash, fragments of the planes can still be found on site. They are monuments of disintegration, dissolving back into the ground.\nThe exhibit has been something we have been wanting to do for over a decade. It is based on the work of Peter W. Merlin, someone who I met in the mid 1990s, when I was working on an exhibition about the Nellis Range in Nevada, and a book about the Nevada Test Site. Though still quite young, Peter was already well on his way to becoming one of the nation’s experts on exotic aircraft development, and failure, and the history of the most secure aviation test site in the nation, popularly known as Area 51, located inside the Nellis Range. Even then he was one of the go-to guys for Discovery Channel producers to interview about what was “really” going on inside this notoriously secret place. The thing was, he knew about that place as well as anybody who wasn’t sworn to secrecy, so he could talk about it. And he found out by sleuthing through non-classified sources.\nUnlike most people who were drawn to that place though, it wasn’t the conspiratorial secrecy and the UFO theories that motivated him, it was a fascination with aircraft, and the missing chapters of aviation history that these secret test sites concealed. While access to the site and to official records was largely out of the question then, he found that visitation to crash sites outside the restricted areas was possible and provided material evidence of what landed there.\nOver the past 25 years, he, often aided by his friend Tony Moore and others, has located and visited more than 100 crash sites of historic aircraft, flown out of Area 51, and Edwards Air Force Base. In nearly every case he was told the site was “lost” and that everything had been removed anyways, so there was no point in trying to find it. But he found them, using clues from interviews with pilots, FOIA requests, and research in archives. Mostly though by days of repeated searches in the field, wandering around, lining up historic photos with subtle geographic features, like hills the distance, or small desert washes, while looking at the ground for incongruous fragments.\nThere is an established subculture of wreck-finders, some of whom publish books on small presses, and blog about their discoveries on the web. Pat Macha, for example, has been leading excursions into the mountains and deserts of California to find wreckage, mostly of civilian and old military training aircraft, for decades. Pete is not only interested in trophy hunting, and the personal thrill of discovery, though that is no doubt a factor – his backyard in Palmdale has a shed full of carefully bagged and logged pieces of hundreds of planes, including U2s, Blackbirds, and Russian Mig’s – a fragmentary history of aviation indeed. The best pieces he finds though go to museums, such as the Air Force Flight Test Center Museum at Edwards, where his partner, Tony Moore, now works.\nPete, who met Tony while he was working as a baggage handler at Burbank Airport, also works on base now, as one of two archivists and historians at NASA’s Dryden Flight Research Center, still the nation’s leading location for experimental aircraft testing. He is now a respected member of the aviation history community. He is a great example of how impassioned “amateurs” are often the experts, especially on subjects that lie beyond the well-worn paths, and the confines of academia.\nFor more about the CLUI exhibit Down to Earth: Experimental Aircraft Crash Sites of the Mojave, go to http://www.clui.org/section/down-earth-experimental-aircraft-crash-sites-mojave\nFor more information Peter W.

It prohibits activities that: “Pursue, hunt, take, capture, kill, attempt to take, capture or kill, possess, offer for sale, sell, offer to purchase, purchase, deliver for shipment, ship, cause to be shipped, deliver for transportation, transport, cause to be transported, carry, or cause to be carried by any means whatever, receive for shipment, transportation or carriage, or export, at any time, or in any manner, any migratory bird, included in the terms of this Convention . . . for the protection of migratory birds . . . or any part, nest, or egg of any such bird.\" (16 U.S.C. 703). This treaty applies to the United States of America and its territories.\nExamples of listed birds are the following:\n- Bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus)\n- Black-capped chickadee (Parus atricapillus)\n- Common night hawk (Chordeiles minor)\n- Red tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis)\n- Barn owl (Tyto alba)\n- Snowy egret (Egretta thula)\nMigratory Birds Impacts & Mitigation\nInfrastructure such as transmission line towers, power lines, ancillary facilities, and substations harm migratory birds, as they are not accustomed to coexisting with high voltage and pathway obstruction. The nesting season lasts from May 1st-September 15th, activating special provisions to protect birds. If construction activities occur during these months, young bird development becomes threatened.\nThe following mitigation measures can decrease the impacts to birds and transmission line facilities:\n- Provide training programs for employees to learn bird migration patterns, area specific species, essential habitats, and laws protecting birds. Develop an Avian Protection Plan to take proactive measures against bird electrocution and injury.\n- To mitigate avian collisions with transmission lines, mark shield wires, guy wires, and overhead optical ground wires with flight diverters. Conduct similar processes in areas where the line crosses, or is adjacent to water.\n- Close off any gaps or narrow open hollow spaces in the proposed facilities or structures capable of trapping cavity-nesting birds. Fill or cap any open-ended posts to discourage new nests during construction.\n- Cover phase conductors with manufactured covers, add perch discouragers on cross arms and on top of poles and space each conductor farther than the minimum distance required to mitigate avian electrocution. Furthermore, use longer horizontal insulators, suspend phase conductors on top of poles and cross arms, install horizontal jumper support to increase the phase-to-ground separation, replace tension members with fiberglass or non-conducting materials, cover tension members with dielectric material, use fiberglass poles or switches, and install standard nest discouragers.\n- Hire a biologist to conduct pre-construction surveys that determine active bird nest status (i.e., containing eggs or young, or a mated pair is observed exhibiting territorial defense, carrying nesting material, and/or transporting food). In some situations, biologists allow vegetation clearing near active bird nests, however noise and physical barriers are mitigation measures to further protect the young birds until they have either “fledged or failed”. In other situations, construction restraints, area closures and site relocation may be suggested to protect the bird habitat.\n- Typical surveys occur within 500 feet of tower sites, laydown/staging areas, substation sites, access/spur road locations, or any other area subject to ground disturbance. If no nests are found, proceed with construction."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:bd1f6be1-1aa3-48bc-aac1-b88a91aa1f10>","<urn:uuid:9f743809-89f9-4268-b2f7-600183273436>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the basic specifications and power requirements for this LED light?","answer":"The Concentrate C5 LED Light Unit is a compact cylindrical plastic device with a 17mm diameter. It runs on a single rechargeable NiMH AAA battery (not included). It features a single reverse clicky switch and 3 RGB LED emitters. The runtime is good for a single AAA battery - using Ikea Ladda 900mAh NiMH AAA batteries, it maintains 80% of original output after 1 hour of use on white mode. The device has no lens over the LED emitters and is designed to fit inside dedicated tubes.","context":["Light Review: Concentrate by Threeworlds C5 LED Light Unit\nThe Concentrate by Threeworlds C5 is a compact RGB light unit designed to illuminate Concentrate’s range of light tubes including the Kali and Play series sticks. Whilst the C5 LED Light Unit is included with these products, it is also available as a standalone product. Some Australian light painters have recently displayed some great photos on Facebook using the C5. With light painters always being on the hunt for more colour changing light options, I thought it would be a timely opportunity to review one.\nThe Concentrate C5 LED Light Unit is a compact plastic cylindrical unit, that houses a single rechargeable NiMH AAA battery (batteries not included – I recommend using Ikea Ladda 900mAh NiMH AAA batteries and a decent smart NiMH or multi-chemistry charger). There is a single reverse clicky switch at one end, and 3 RGB LED emitters at the other end.\nAs the C5 is designed to live within the end of a dedicated tube, it isn’t built as sturdy as a flashlight. There is also no lens over the LED emitters to protect them. So care needs to be taken when using this device. It is relatively narrow at 17mm diameter, and is thus narrower than commercial light painting connectors. A little bit of DIY is required to connect it to light painting tools – personally I’m using some fuzzy tape around the C5 so that it snugly fits inside the Light Painting Brushes Universal Connector. A silicone end cap can also be ordered from Threeworlds which also makes it easier to fit inside some light painting connectors – I wish I had known this when I purchased it!\nThe Concentrate C5 has a single switch which is used for both mode selection and programming. The C5 unfortunately does not maintain static colours (unless you leave it in programming mode, or program a fade with the same colours – thanks to Tom Hill for that advice), but handles complex multi-coloured patterns very well. For programming, there are 10 colour options (red, orange, yellow, green, light blue, royal blue, purple, pink, white, and black), and 7 mode options (fade, slow alternating, fast alternating, slow strobe, fast strobe, strobe dash, and cycling all modes). It is possible to program between 2 and 4 colours per mode. There are 9 presets included (accessible via single click from off), and you can also save 6 presets (click and hold from off). A press and hold (1.5secs) from on turns off the C5. Unless the mode you want to use is the first preset, there is no last mode memory, nor momentary functionality. There is also no brightness adjustment, nor full spectrum colour fade modes.\nCreating presets is quite easy. A double, triple, or quadruple click is required to enter 2, 3, or 4 colour modes respectively. A click moves between colour, a hold (1.5secs) selects the colour. After each hold, the light flashes twice to acknowledge the selection. After the colours have been selected, the programming mode moves to effect mode choice. A single click moves between effect mode. A hold (1.5secs) saves the program to the saved mode bank. If you decide you don’t want to save a program, just keep holding until the C5 turns off. The light comes with a good set of instructions, and it doesn’t take too long to work out the programming user interface.\nOutput and Beam\nThere are 3x 5mm LEDs – Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) which are surprisingly bright for the size of the device and running off a single AAA battery. The LEDs all protrude from the top of the device, and there is no lens or diffuser.\nThe beam pattern is surprisingly throwy. The output (white/RGB all on) was measured at 36 lumens. This is slightly brighter than the Color Shine Flashlight (white/RGB all on) and Ledlenser P7QC on low mode. However, due to the beam pattern being much more throwy (i.e. projecting the light forwards in a narrow beam) the peak beam intensity (candela/lux) is noticeably higher than the Color Shine flashlight. The C5 is approx. 0.5 stop of a photographic exposure better at illuminating light painting tools such as light blades, swords, and tubes than the Color Shine Flashlight. The narrower beam means that it may be not so good at evenly illuminating tools such as fibre optics. Due to the low output, the C5 is best used in studio and dark ambient conditions, and wide aperture and/or high ISO are required for an accurate exposure.\nDue to the 3 separate LEDs and no diffuser, colour mixing straight out of the light is poor, so this light isn’t great for illuminating objects. However when illuminating light painting tools, I find the the colours tend to mix more within the light painting tool, but not perfectly.\nThere is no visible Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) in the C5 (if there is PWM, it is too fast to be picked up by cameras, video, or the human eye). This means that the light trails produced by the C5 are beautifully smooth – this is excellent!\nRuntime is also pretty good for a single AAA battery, indicating efficient electronics and LEDs. After 1 hour runtime, on white (RGB all on) using Ikea Ladda 900mAh NiMH AAA batteries, output was at 80% of the original output. Using Alkaline batteries, and not so good NiMH batteries will result in shorter runtimes.\nThings I liked:\nGood output for a single AAA battery RGB light\nRelatively high peak beam intensity (compared to similar lights)\nGood range of colours\nGood range of effect patterns\nEasily programmable effect patterns\nNo visible PWM\nGood instructions included\nThings I didn’t like (and I’m being picky here):\nNo full spectrum colour fade mode\nPoor colour mixing\nNo brightness adjustment, last mode memory, or momentary functionality\nThe Concentrate by Threeworlds C5 Light Unit is an interesting programmable RGB light source, that allows for many creative colour effects with beautifully smooth PWM-free light trails. A little bit of DIY may be required to attach it to light painting tools. It is another tool that light painters shouldn’t be without."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c959d3f1-e5a5-41b6-a558-4a926f265bc8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"+TIPs vs motor proteins?","answer":"Plus-end-tracking proteins (+TIPs) and motor proteins interact differently with microtubules. +TIPs localize specifically to growing microtubule ends, reaching these ends either through motor-mediated transport or diffusion, and regulate microtubule dynamics and interactions with cellular components. They concentrate at microtubule ends and require end-binding (EB) proteins for localization. In contrast, motor proteins like dynein and kinesin walk along the entire length of microtubules in a unidirectional manner, using ATP hydrolysis for energy. These motors transport cargo such as endocytic vesicles, synaptic vesicles, ribosomes, or proteins by binding to both the microtubule and the cargo simultaneously.","context":["- PDF (131 kb)\n- Full Text with Thumbnail Figures\n- Full Text with Large Figures\n- Cited by in Scopus (2)\n- Request permission\n- EBs Recognize a Nucleotide-Dependent Structural Cap at Growing Microtubule Ends\nCell, Volume 149, Issue 2, 13 April 2012, Pages 371-382\nSebastian P. Maurer, Franck J. Fourniol, Gergő Bohner, Carolyn A. Moores and Thomas Surrey\nSummaryGrowing microtubule ends serve as transient binding platforms for essential proteins that regulate microtubule dynamics and their interactions with cellular substructures. End-binding proteins (EBs) autonomously recognize an extended region at growing microtubule ends with unknown structural characteristics and then recruit other factors to the dynamic end structure. Using cryo-electron microscopy, subnanometer single-particle reconstruction, and fluorescence imaging, we present a pseudoatomic model of how the calponin homology (CH) domain of the fission yeast EB Mal3 binds to the end regions of growing microtubules. The Mal3 CH domain bridges protofilaments except at the microtubule seam. By binding close to the exchangeable GTP-binding site, the CH domain is ideally positioned to sense the microtubule's nucleotide state. The same microtubule-end region is also a stabilizing structural cap protecting the microtubule from depolymerization. This insight supports a common structural link between two important biological phenomena, microtubule dynamic instability and end tracking.\nSummary | Full Text | PDF (2400 kb)\n- Rapid Microtubule Self-Assembly Kinetics\nCell, Volume 146, Issue 4, 19 August 2011, Pages 582-592\nMelissa K. Gardner, Blake D. Charlebois, Imre M. Jánosi, Jonathon Howard, Alan J. Hunt and David J. Odde\nSummaryMicrotubule assembly is vital for many fundamental cellular processes. Current models for microtubule assembly kinetics assume that the subunit dissociation rate from a microtubule tip is independent of free subunit concentration. Total-Internal-Reflection-Fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy experiments and data from a laser tweezers assay that measures in vitro microtubule assembly with nanometer resolution, provides evidence that the subunit dissociation rate from a microtubule tip increases as the free subunit concentration increases. These data are consistent with a two-dimensional model for microtubule assembly, and are explained by a shift in microtubule tip structure from a relatively blunt shape at low free concentrations to relatively tapered at high free concentrations. We find that because both the association and the dissociation rates increase at higher free subunit concentrations, the kinetics of microtubule assembly are an order-of-magnitude higher than currently estimated in the literature.\nSummary | Full Text | PDF (2035 kb)\n- Plus-End-Tracking Proteins and Their Interactions at Microtubule Ends\nCurrent Biology, Volume 20, Issue 12, 22 June 2010, Pages R528-R537\nSummaryMicrotubules are cytoskeletal elements that are essential for a large number of intracellular processes, including mitosis, cell differentiation and migration, and vesicle transport. In many cells, the microtubule network is organized in a radial manner, with one end of a microtubule (the minus end) embedded near the nucleus and the other end (the plus end) exploring cytoplasmic space, switching between episodes of growth and shrinkage. Mammalian plus-end-tracking proteins (+TIPs) localize to the ends of growing microtubules and regulate both the dynamic behavior of microtubules as well as the interactions of microtubules with other cellular components. Because of these crucial roles, +TIPs and the mechanisms underlying their association with microtubule ends have been intensively investigated. Results indicate that +TIPs reach microtubule ends by motor-mediated transport or diffusion. Individual +TIP molecules exchange rapidly on microtubule end-binding sites that are formed during microtubule polymerization and that have a slower turnover. Most +TIPs associate with the end-binding (EB) proteins, and appear to require these ‘core’ +TIPs for localization at microtubule ends. Accumulation of +TIPs may also involve structural features of the microtubule end and interactions with other +TIPs. This complexity makes it difficult to assign discrete roles to specific +TIPs. Given that +TIPs concentrate at microtubule ends and that each +TIP binds in a conformationally distinct manner, I propose that the ends of growing microtubules are ‘nano-platforms’ for productive interactions between selected proteins and that these interactions might persist and be functional elsewhere in the cytoplasm than at the microtubule end at which they originated.\nSummary | Full Text | PDF (571 kb)\nCopyright © 2007 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.\nCurrent Biology, Volume 17, Issue 17, R764-R766, 4 September 2007\nDispatchAdd/View Comments (0)\nMicrotubule Polymerization: One Step at a Time\n- The dynamic assembly of microtubules is a key factor in many of their functions in the cell and recent experiments give new insight into this process at the molecular level.","The cytoskeleton is a highly dynamic network of filamentous proteins that exists in the 3D space to link all regions and components of the cell. All cells, including bacteria, have a cytoskeleton in one form or another. This network is multifunctional, providing structural support to the cell, a framework for active transport mechanisms and a system for the generation and transduction of mechanical force.\nThe cytoskeleton is analogous to both railroad tracks that connect various parts of a city, and also the steel framework of a high-rise building. One enables the directed delivery of passengers or cargo around a city while the other ensures the building will not collapse under its own weight, and can support a dynamic internal environment.\nIn the same way, a cell that does not possess a cytoskeleton would be nothing more than a very soft and fluid collection of organelles. Cells would be unable to support their own weight, let alone that of a tissue or organ, and, would lose essential signaling pathways, motility, cytokinesis, organelle movement, delivery of components; i.e. they would be incapable of carrying out the essential processes that give rise to life\nThe cytoskeleton maintains cellular organization by linking together many cellular components. It mediates communication across the entire cell and therefore has a tremendous impact on cellular functions.\nThere are three main components to the cytoskeleton. These can be considered as unique networks with distinct compositions that possess slightly different yet interdependent functions. They are microfilaments, microtubules and intermediate filaments.\nMicrofilaments are actin polymers of ~7nm width. They form an extensive network throughout the cell and are primarily composed of actin, which is the most abundant protein in cells. Microfilaments are believed to provide protrusive and contractile forces to the cell and assist in cell motility. They have very high compressive strength however actin binding proteins decrease this and allow bending. Microfilaments act as a major signal transducer from the outside environment to the interior of the cell.\nMicrotubules are the largest cytoskeletal element, being 20-25nm in width, and substantially longer than microfilaments. These filaments play important roles in cell communication and cytokinesis. Microtubules are formed through the lateral association of between 12 and 17 tubulin protofilaments, which arrange to form a very stiff and hollow filament structure. Microtubules are also highly dynamic, undergoing rapid cycles of polymerization and depolymerization in a process known as dynamic instability. Microtubules emanate from a microtubule organizing centre (MTOC) where their minus end is embedded and the plus end grows towards the cell periphery. Amongst their most important functions is to ensure that chromosomes are equally distributed amongst the daughter cells. The movement of cilia and flagella is also microtubule dependent.\nIntermediate filaments are the third type of cytoskeletal filament and represent a larger group of filaments that share structural and functional similarities. Five types of intermediate filaments have been described, and although each type is composed of different monomer proteins, their mechanism of assembly is consistent and produces filaments of around 10nm in width. Up to 50 different proteins may be incorporated into intermediate filaments. Intermediate filaments form an elaborate network not only in the cytoplasm but also in the nucleus in the form of lamina. They are highly flexible, yet much more stable than both microfilaments and microtubules. Intermediate filaments have no known role in cell motility however they do provide mechanical stability to cells at regions of cell-cell contacts.\nThe steel framework of many of modern buildings is designed and constructed to survive a multitude of forces. External forces such as wind, or earthquakes, must be withstood, while internal forces such as weight must be distributed evenly throughout the structure. In a similar way the cytoskeleton must withstand the vast range of external and internal forces acting on the cell. Aside from a certain degree of flexibility, the framework within buildings is not a dynamic structure, and this is where the cytoskeleton, being extremely dynamic, differs.\nWith the exception of intermediate filaments, cytoskeletal filaments are constantly undergoing cycles of polymerization and depolymerization. When describing actin filament or microfilament assembly this process is referred as ‘treadmilling’. Microtubules on the other hand undergo a process known as “dynamic instability?.\nUnlike buildings, cells are living entities that are highly dynamic themselves. They are constantly interacting with their environment and responding accordingly. They may change their shape, or the shape of their nucleus, they may commence cell migration, enter a state of rest or undergo the process of programmed cell death. In order to meet with the requirements of the cell, the cytoskeleton needs to be equally dynamic.\nFor example, during cell migration, the cytoskeleton rapidly changes to produce a polarized cell with a “front” or “leading” edge, and a back or “trailing” edge. The rapid development of a microfilament network at the leading edge, in a region known as the lamellipodia, generates protrusive force, and helps the cell to move forward whilst simultaneously retracting the cell from the rear. In another example, during cell division chromosomes must separate and cellular organelles must be redistributed amongst daughter cells. This is followed by a pinching of the cell membrane into two. These processes require a very dynamic cytoskeleton that can rapidly depolymerize to allow old structures to be dissolved and new structures to be formed.\nAdditionally, when mechanical stress is applied to cells, microtubules rapidly reorient themselves and actin stress fibers increase in density in order to reinforce their mechanical strength. Cell processes such as cilia, flagella also move because of the dynamics of the cytoskeleton within.\nCells, like cities, are reliant on the efficient delivery of ‘goods’ or components to specific regions or sites. While cities utilize roads and railway lines for cargo delivery, cells utilize the cytoskeleton for this purpose. Interestingly, the cellular machinery that carries cargo along cytoskeletal filaments is still prone to becoming stuck in traffic, and as such, specific properties of proteins, and even mechanisms, have evolved to ensure cellular components can be transported as efficiently as possible.\nIn some cells where cargo must travel long distances, such as neurons, the passive diffusion of components is not efficient. Not only is it slow, but the gradients of soluble proteins may not be concentrated enough to maintain the supply of components to the process site. The cellular cytoskeleton enables an active delivery of components by providing the ‘tracks’ on which molecular motors can walk. Both the microtubules and microfilaments have specific motor proteins that walk along them. Myosins, for example, walk on microfilaments while dynein and kinesin walk on microtubules. These motors walk in a unidirectional manner and harness the energy released from ATP hydrolysis to undergo conformational changes that propel them forward, essentially in the form of taking a step forward. While one end of the protein holds onto the cytoskeleton, the other end binds to the cargo. This cargo may be contained within endocytic vesicles or synaptic vesicles, or exist as ribosomes or proteins. The cargo is delivered at the end of the filament or whenever the motor detaches from the cytoskeleton. Since this method utilizes energy from ATP, it occurs rapidly, making it more efficient than diffusion alone. However, free or facilitated diffusion along a concentration gradient is important for many cellular processes. Depending on the properties of the diffusing component (e.g. free ions, proteins, lipids), and the lack of an energy requirement, diffusion can be a highly efficient method of intracellular transport.\nThe cytoskeleton acts as the load-bearing network in cells and hence it has a major role in transducing mechanical signals throughout cells. Not only does it act as a bridge between the extracellular environment and the cell interior, but it can transduce signals in a fast and efficient manner. Signal transduction via the diffusion of chemical entities is a much slower process. Signal transduction via the cytoskeleton is made possible, in part, by the multitude of signaling molecules that bind to the cytoskeleton and are activated by mechanical stimuli.\nFurthermore, due to the ability of the cytoskeleton to link the various cellular components, it can easily transmit signals amongst various compartments such as the Golgi or the nucleus and the membrane. Not only does the cytoskeleton enable the cell to respond quickly to external mechanical signals but it may also generate signals internally. Such signals commonly result from the pull of myosin motor proteins on actin filaments.\nThe effect of external stimuli is apparent in the increase of actin stress fibers and their realignment when cells are exposed to shear stress or plated on certain geometric patterns . In the case of localized stresses there is usually an increase in the cytoskeletal network at that point .\nGiven the widespread role of the cytoskeleton in cellular functions, it is hardly surprising that it is also associated with a large variety of diseases. Certain genetic mutations may result in a weak cytoskeleton that is unable to provide adequate support to the cell. A mutation in the nuclear protein lamin A causes the truncated protein progerin to be formed which is associated with a disease known as progeria. In this disease cells have a weak nucleus due to defects in the nucleoskeleton . Defects in the mitotic spindle are linked to chromosomal instability and subsequently associated with tumors . Remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton is also closely linked to cancers as cells grow in crowded environments with limited nutrient supply .\nA disruption in the cellular cytoskeleton would result in an overall disruption in cell organization as well as in cellular transport mechanisms. Axonal processes in neurons are a prime example of this. Since axonal processes can be extremely long, their function is highly dependent on microtubule-based transport . Disruption of microtubule function has thus been linked to neurodegenerative diseases and myopathies. These are due to the poor delivery of components to synaptic junctions . A dysfunctional actin cytoskeleton, on the other hand, is often linked to muscular defects. In this case cardiac muscles are particularly susceptible as their activity is largely based on actomyosin driven contractility .\nMicroorganisms such as bacteria can also exploit a host cell’s cytoskeleton and improve the chance of infection. Enteropathogenic bacteria such as Escherichia coli induces the polymerization of actin and the formation of pedestals which they then use to attach to the cell . Others such as Listeria monocytogenes and vaccinia virus use actin tails to propel themselves inside host cells . In another example, the bacteria Clostridium difficile secretes toxins that induce actin reorganization, thus assisting the bacteria in cell invasion .\nLikewise, microtubule formation and function can also be manipulated by microorganisms. The entry of Campylobacter jejuni and Escherichia coli to the cell are microtubule dependent. This is because depolymerization of microtubules would otherwise inhibit their entry. The HIV virus is also known to disrupt the microtubule network in cells and the microtubule motor protein, dynein, is essential for adenoviral entry into cells . These examples illustrate that the cytoskeleton is not only used by cells for their function, but extensively utilized by pathogenic organisms to facilitate their own functions, leading to the and onset of disease."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d4ad04b3-2593-4338-9424-91f20df3a5dc>","<urn:uuid:20b741fe-7fb8-41ad-976f-9394b4806695>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the size differences between oak itch mites and house dust mites?","answer":"Oak itch mites are extremely tiny, measuring less than 1/125 of an inch with mouthparts only 1/700 of an inch long. In comparison, house dust mites are larger, though still small, measuring less than half a millimetre in length. Both species are difficult to see with the naked eye.","context":["Numerous reports of rashes have been made to public health officials in areas of northern Illinois during the month of August. Similar rashes were reported in Kansas, Nebraska, Missouri and Texas during 2004 and those rash outbreaks resulted from bites from a species of the itch mite, Pyemotes herfsi. The same itch mite is also suspected as the cause of the Illinois rashes. The recent rashes have been described as red welts that look like chigger bites on the neck, face, arms and upper body; unlike chigger bites, they are not typically on the legs and don’t hurt when the bites occur. The bites are initially invisible but form into a pimple-like lesion after about 12 hours and can be present for up to two weeks. While oak itch mite bites do not pose a major health threat, they can cause intense itching; in addition, scratching can introduce germs into the skin which can cause infection.\nSome questions and answers regarding the suspected oak itch mite bites in Illinois follow:\nWhy has it been so hard to confirm which mite is causing the rashes occurring in Illinois? A lot of my neighbors are asking why not get an oak leaf and test it or sit under an oak tree?\nThere are more than 45,000 species of mites. Oak itch mites can cause leaf tissue to swell, resulting in a brown, crusty edge on the leaves (known as gall). But plant diseases and injury may produce gall as well. Oak leaves with this appearance are being collected and examined by expert entomologists. Mite populations in a location may vary with weather; other factors also affect the number of specimens available for collecting.\nHow did they determine this mite is the likely culprit?\nItch mites are suspected based on the lack of pain or visible insects on the skin before the welts occur, the appearance and location of the bites, the intense itching and the outdoor exposures of many of those who are affected.\nMy street has no oak trees yet everyone on my street has these bites. Why?\nAlthough oaks are believed to be this itch mite's primary habitat, itch mites may have a range of habitats; also itch mites (which are wingless) can be blown some distance by the wind.\nWhat are other possibilities for the causes of these rashes?\nSome biting pests such as ticks and bed bugs produce painless bites. In addition to the oak itch mite, other species of mites may be capable of causing this syndrome.\nIf it is the itch mite, why don't I feel them crawling on my body?\nThe mite is extremely tiny (less than 1/125 of an inch with mouthparts that are only 1/700 of an inch long).\nMany people have said that their bites seem to multiply overnight. Do the mites remain on the body unless we wash them off?\nMites may remain on the body for a few hours unless washed or brushed off.\nShould I shower and wash every time I come in from outside if I'm in an area where itch mite associated rashes are occurring?\nA hot shower, along with soap and the action of washing should get rid of the mites.\nClothes worn outside where itch mites are present should not be worn again until they are washed.\nCan these mites live and reproduce in my home?\nNo. Without insect larvae to feed on, itch mites will die indoors within a few hours.\nAre the bites dangerous for humans?\nItchy welts on the skin are usually the only problem. Occasionally, individuals who are very sensitive, or have many bites, may develop fever, fatigue or nausea. Bites may become infected if germs are introduced into broken skin caused by excessive scratching.\nSome people say the bites are itchier than any they've had before. How do you treat it?\nThe bites can be extremely itchy. Topical steroid creams such as 1 percent hydrocortisone cream should help relieve inflammation and may be purchased without a prescription at pharmacies. More potent steroid creams are available with a prescription. Antihistamines such as benadryl can also help reduce itching.\nHow long does the itching last?\nUsually one to two weeks.\nIf bitten, are the young or the elderly at more risk for infection?\nNot usually - the concern is to prevent infection from excessive scratching and this concern applies to all ages.\nWhy does it seem that even in the same household or on the same block, some people suffer more than others?\nIt is most likely that one person may encounter more mites than another person. This can vary due to the length of time they were outside, if the wind carried more mites to a certain location, the type of clothing a person was wearing, etc.\nAny idea how long the itch mites will be around?\nIn Kansas, it was determined that itch mites were present until the temperature dropped below freezing. It is possible that other factors, like moisture, may affect how long the itch mites remain active.\nAm I at risk of getting bitten whenever I go out?\nIn neighborhoods where people have developed this rash, or in areas where trees have oak leaf galls (brown, crusty edges on the oak leaves), it is wise to assume that itch mites may be present and take precautions.\nWhat precautions can I take?\nIf you see brown, crusty edges on oak tree leaves consistent with the appearance of galls, be aware that mite activity is possible. Do not sit under or near these oak trees.\nIf you are in an area where you know itch mite associated rashes are occurring, or nearby oak tree leaves have brown and crusty edges: keep windows and doors shut from August through October, weather permitting, when \"mite showers\" can occur; remove clothing items worn outside and launder each day; and take a warm, soapy shower after coming indoors, especially after gardening, raking leaves or performing other outdoor activities.","The house dust mite gets its name from its habitat – household dust. The main component of dust is shed skin flakes, which is the mite’s preferred food source. Areas around the home that are heavily used, such as beds and upholstered furniture, will have much higher mite populations than the rest of the house.\nThe most common type of dust mite found in Australian homes is Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, which tends to prefer coastal rather than inland areas. This mite has been associated with dermatological and respiratory allergies in humans, such as eczema and asthma. However, there is no single, definitive sign that house dust mites trigger a person’s allergy symptoms. Asthma, for example, can be triggered by a range of other indoor allergens such as fungi (moulds) or animal dander (fluff from hair, fur or feathers).\nSymptoms of allergic reaction to dust mites\nHouse dust mites can trigger respiratory or dermatological conditions including asthma and eczema. Symptoms can include:\n- a tight feeling in the chest\n- runny nose\n- itchy nose\n- itchy eyes\n- itchy skin\n- skin rashes.\nPhysical characteristics of the house dust mite\nThe characteristics of a house dust mite include:\n- less than half a millimetre in length, which makes it hard to see with the naked eye\n- oval-shaped body\n- light coloured body with fine stripes\n- life span of around two months or so, depending on the conditions.\nAllergic reaction to dust mites\nUnlike other common household bugs (fleas, for example), dust mites don’t bite. Their bodies, secretions and faeces contain particular proteins that can trigger allergic symptoms in susceptible people.\nCommon hiding spots for dust mites\nThe diet of the house dust mite includes shed skin flakes, pollen and fungal spores. It prefers warm, humid and dark environments. Common hiding spots around the home include:\n- mattresses and bed linen\n- upholstered furniture\n- shag-pile or long-fibred carpets\n- soft toys.\nDiagnosis and treatment for dust mite allergies\nAllergy testing can determine whether house dust mites trigger your respiratory or dermatological symptoms. See your doctor for further information and advice.\nIf tests show that you are allergic to house dust mites, there are ways to reduce your immune system response. For example, you could undergo allergen immunotherapy, which involves deliberately exposing you to dust mite extracts to ‘train’ your immune system not to overreact.\nMeasures designed to reduce your household’s dust mite population may also be helpful.\nHow to reduce the dust mites in your home\nIt is impossible to destroy your entire dust mite population, but you can reduce their numbers. Allergic reactions are dose-related, so the fewer dust mites you have in your home, the less you may be troubled by respiratory or dermatological symptoms.\nIt is important to remember that the droppings of dead dust mites continue to provoke allergic reactions. You must not only reduce your dust mite population, but also take steps to remove their dead bodies and faeces from your home.\nTips to reduce dust mites in your home\n- Cover mattresses, pillows and quilts with dust mite resistant covers. The covers must be washed every two months. Some health funds may provide a rebate for these items.\n- Wash sheets and pillowcases weekly in water hotter than 55°C. Alternatively, if washing in cold water, use a commercial product containing essential oils, such as eucalyptus or tea tree oil.\n- Hot tumble dry (for half an hour after dry) or dry clean household items – this will kill house dust mites, but not the allergen they produce.\n- Wash blankets and non-encased doonas every two months.\n- Use synthetic rather than feather pillows and doonas, as these tolerate regular washing.\n- Remove sheepskin or woollen underlays and any other sheepskin products.\n- Remove all soft toys from the bedroom and replace with wooden or plastic toys, which can be washed. Or, if a soft toy is allowed, it should be washed weekly using the same method used for sheets. (Freezing soft toys overnight doesn’t work, because it doesn’t remove the allergen.)\n- Damp dust or use electrostatic cloths to clean hard surfaces weekly, rather than a feather duster.\n- Reduce humidity – have a dry and well-ventilated house. Have adequate floor and wall insulation and avoid evaporative coolers.\n- Avoid upholstered furniture – leather, vinyl, plastic and wood are best.\n- Avoid heavy curtains – Venetian blinds or flat blinds are better. Washable curtains or external shutters are other options.\n- Wash clothing before use if it has been stored for a long time.\n- Remove carpets, rugs and mats (where practical and affordable) – bare boards and tiled floors are preferable as they can be damp mopped or cleaned with electrostatic cloths.\n- Wash rugs and mats regularly and dry them outside in full sunshine (if possible).\n- Vacuum weekly, including the seams of mattresses and upholstered furniture. Vacuuming causes house dust mite allergens to become airborne for up to 20 minutes, so if you are allergic to dust mites, you should wear a mask or ask someone else to vacuum. You may air the house for an hour or so after vacuum cleaning to help clear the air.\nDubious dust mite treatments\nSome treatments that claim to reduce dust mite populations have little or no benefit, including:\n- chemical sprays\n- air filters\n- electric blankets\n- negative ion generators\n- allergen-free products.\nWhere to get help\nThis page has been produced in consultation with and approved by:\nAustralasian Society of Clinical Immunology and Allergy (ASCIA)\nContent on this website is provided for information purposes only.

You may wish to catch up with that story first.\nFirth, Pond & Co?\nThere were a lot of flute makers in the young American nation, some of the most famous being tied together at times as Firth, Hall and Pond. It's hard to keep track of the intertwining fortunes of John Firth, Sylvanus Pond and William Hall; here's an attempt:\nSo Hall & Son and Firth & Son both bought out by Ditson! Now in case the name Ditson doesn't ring any bells, one of its employees (at age 15 in 1845) was a John Haynes. John was later to take over the company and forge a new empire in flutemaking in his own name that continues to this day.\nAnd William Hall?\nWe've looked at a William Hall flute separately ...\nNow, about this flute ...\nAbove: The Firth, Pond & Co\noriginal in cocus\nThe flute we're looking at dates from between 1847 and 1863. Unfortunately, the company didn't apply serial numbers, so we have no way of estimating just when the flute was made.\nWell, I mentioned small holes, and, sure enough, they are pretty tiny! To put some numbers on it, let's fall back on the old standby, hole 5. This is the hole that varies most on 8-key style flutes. Starting at the big end of town ...\nSo, despite its late date (Boehm had brought out his cylindrical flute by then), this flute seems to have more in common with first generation London-made 8-keys of some 50 years earlier. Or could it be derived from a French or German tradition? Let's see what we can infer ...\nLet's look at some of the characteristics of the flute and see how they relate to the different old-world styles. Shading indicates the best matches ...\nOn the face of the evidence, it seems likely that the Firth, Pond & Co most follows the English tradition, although we are unaware at this time as to what (if any) particular instrument it might emulate. It's quite possible that the makers surveyed the field and selected features from more than one of the flute-making traditions represented in the new land.\nThe bore, seen in extremely exaggerated form below, is in general reminiscent of short foot flutes in general, and perhaps French flutes in particular. We see the cylindrical head (with stopper face, embouchure hole and tuning slide effect) in aqua, left hand section in navy, right hand in hot pink and foot in yellow. Note the typical flaring from around E to the end of the foot. Note also the kinks and bends in the left hand section.\nOne of the reasons for success of the short foot flute is evident above. Notice that the bore at its minimum is almost 12mm in diameter, whereas many English C-footed flutes descend to under 10.5mm. It's probably here that we see the basis of Quantz's criticism of the extended foot.\nThis venting chart shows the placement of the finger holes and the ratio of finger hole diameter to bore diameter at the same point.\nWe see the inevitable clustering of holes into where they can be reached by the fingers of the two hands, plus the usual gap to the foot notes. The much larger diameters of the foot notes acts to offset their distance. The makers have also managed to locate G# much closer to halfway between A and G than is common.\nDoes the tuning of the flute have anything to tell us? I tested the intonation at three pitches, with the slide fully compressed (449 Hz), at modern pitch (440Hz at 6mm extension) and at 12mm extension. Perhaps the first thing to note is the pitch fully compressed. Most English flutes would have soared to around 460Hz - this flute doesn't even reach British High Pitch at 452-455.\nAt zero extension (449Hz) we see noticeable tilt in both octaves. Further, the middle foot notes D5 and Eb5 are flat compared to their neighbours.\nAt 6mm extension, 440 Hz, the tilt is gone, although a flattening is visible below G4 (G in the bottom octave).\nAt 12mm, we're starting to see significant sharpening of the second octave compared to the lower. The flute seems happiest in the circa 440Hz region.\nThe flattening below G4 is an unusual feature - perhaps Firth & Pond's version of the English flat foot. It just starts a little higher up, but is much much milder in quantity.\nWe do expect small hole flutes to be quieter than large hole flutes, but as can be seen from this comparison, this flute is quite capable of holding its own with its larger sisters.\nFor comparison with other flutes, here's some significant dimensions:\nSo, all in all, quite an unusual flute. I've added it to my range of models as I feel it has something special that will delight some players.\nThanks to flute owner and player, Grey Larsen, for his assistance in coming to grips with the Firth, Pond & Co."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:74c007b3-d538-4c3a-88da-85b9c6fba2ee>","<urn:uuid:aca094ac-3db2-48f9-ac48-35aae976156f>"],"error":null}
