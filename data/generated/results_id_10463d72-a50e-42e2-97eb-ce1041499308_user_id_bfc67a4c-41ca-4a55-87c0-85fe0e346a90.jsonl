{"question":"I'm analyzing complex chess games. In the Topalov-Kramnik match, could you explain how the positional struggle evolved from the opening to the endgame, and what were the critical tactical turning points that decided the outcome?","answer":"The game began from a Czech system of the Queen's Gambit Slav, where Kramnik chose an antiquated variation and secured his kingside with 17...f5. The position transformed dramatically when Topalov initiated complications with 20.g4, launching a fierce kingside attack. The positional struggle intensified as Kramnik developed counterplay on the queenside, forcing Topalov to temporarily retreat. A major turning point came with Topalov's elegant 28.Qc2 followed by a queen sacrifice, which revived his kingside threats. The complexity peaked around moves 31-32, where Kramnik's error 31...Bxf8 should have lost immediately, but Topalov missed the winning continuation with 32.Qg6+. The game then transitioned into an unbalanced endgame where White had connected passed pawns against Black's material advantage. Despite Topalov maintaining attacking chances in the endgame, Kramnik's precise defensive technique and systematic conversion of his advantages led to his victory.","context":["Game II V.Topalov - V.Kramnik\n1.d4 d5 2.c4 c6 3.Nc3 Nf6 4.Nf3 dxc4 5.a4 Bf5 6.e3 e6 7.Bxc4 Bb4 8.0-0 Nbd7 9.Qe2 Bg6 10.e4 0-0 It's been known for already many years, that acceptin a pawn sacrifice after 10...Bc3 11.bxc3 Nxe4 12.Ba3 forces black to castle long - right under white's attack. 11.Bd3 Bh5 12.e5 Nd5 13.Nxd5 cxd5 14.Qe3 Bg6 15.Ng5 Re8 It's all well known till this moment.

Both this replies are strongly met with 17.g4! 17.Qd3 f5 18.Be3 Somewhat unexpected. In the first turn moves 18.g4!? and 18.Qb5 would strike an eye. Yet 18.Qb5 looks like going somewhat astray, after 18...Qe7 19.Qxb7 h6 20.Nh3 ( after 20.Nf3 reply 20...Nxe5 is not bad) black can for example play 20...a6 preparing a \"perpetual\" to white queen and draw. 18.g4 is interesting, but very risky: after 18...h6 white has to sacrifice a knight by one of some possible ways] 18...Nf8 19.Kh1 Rc8 20.g4!\nVery strong! This \"edition\" of exploding the position is more justified than two moves ago. Black is not to be envied.20...h6 is dubious because of 21.Nxe6 Rxe6 22.gxf5 followed by 23.Rg1 with mighty pressure on g-file. 20...fxg4 only helps white to open the files: 21.f5 Be7 [21...exf5 22.Qxf5 favours white (white has a dangerous initiative also after 22.Rxf5 ) 22...Qd7 23.e6!] 22.f6!

(not allowing the knight exchange), and initiative is clearly on white's side.\n20...Qd7 Perhaps, this is more precise than considered above 20...g6 with the same defensive purpose, because it doen't give white an instant target - g6 pawn may be attacked with white h-pawn advance.\n21.Rg1 Be7 22.Nf3 Rc4 Black doesn't have any counterplay other than on c-file, but white's initiative on g-file and the kingside together with big space advantage appear to be of more significance.23.Rg2 [it was possible to chase the rook away by including 23.b3 Rc6 , but Topalov is not distracted by such trifles as an a4-pawn.\n23...fxg4 24.Rxg4 Rxa4 Vladimir Kramnik piks up the gauntlet!

Now the game looks like drawish.Correct was 36.Qh5! a5 (It's difficult to suggest anything better: 36...Qxe3 37.Ng5 is bad) 37.Rg3!

Qxc2+ 39.Kg3 The king has come to support his army. The position is likely to become incredibly sharp again! 40.Bf4?!

Now presumably the strongest moves for both sides lead to a beautiful draw: 41.Ng5 Rc7 42.Nxe6 Rc3+ 43.Kh4 Qh7+ 44.Kg5 Bh6+ 45.Kh5+ Bg7+ 46.Kg5\n42.Bg5 Topalov strengthens his wedge on f6. 42.fxg7? would be useless because of 42...Rxg7+ 43.Bg5 a5 , and black is close to a victory. Matters are much more complicated with the move 42.Ng5!? For example, the following variation is interesting: 42...Bf8 (42...Bxf6? is bad: 43.Nxf7 Kxf7 44.exf6 Kxf6 45.Bc7 winning) 43.Kh4 a5 44.Kh5 a4 45.Kg6 a3 46.Nxf7 a2 47.e6 a1Q 48.Nh6+ Kh8 49.e7 and white wins. Correct for black is 42...Rc7 with an unclear position.42...a5 43.Kf4 a4 44.Kxf5 a3\n45.Bc1 It would clearly favour black playing 45.Nd2 a2 46.Nb3 Rc7 47.e6 Bxf6 48.Kxf6 Kf8 with possible continuation 49.Ke5 Rc2 50.Kd6 Ke8 51.Bf4 Rb2 52.Na1 Rb1 53.Nc2 b5 and white is helpless against the forthcoming b-pawn advance. Now black can win by means of 45...a2 46.Bb2 Rc7 47.e6 Bf8 48.Ng5 Bd6 49.Kg6 Rc6 , but to find this at the board, especially the last two \"computer moves\", is very difficult. 45...Rc7 is weaker. After 46.Bxa3 Rc3 47.Ng5 Rxa3 48.fxg7 white may perhaps obtain counterplay enough to save the game.\n45...Bf8 Kramnik's idea is clarified by the variation 46.e6 Rc7 47.e7 Be7 48.fe7 Rxe7 49.Bxa3 Re3 and black must win step by step.46.e6 Rc7 47.Ba3 Ba3 48.Ke5\n48...Rc1 48...Rc2 or 48...Rc3 was possible approximately with the same ideas, white will respond with Nf3-g5 anyway. 49.Ng5 [49.Kxd5 loses to 49...Rf1 50.e7 Bxe7 51.fxe7 Kf7]\n49...Rf1?! An errror, correct continuation would be intermediate 49...Rg1 forcing 50.Nf7, and only now 50...Rf1, and 50...b5! is even stronger: 51.Kxd5 Rf1 52.Ke5 b4 winning] 50.e7 Re1+ 51.Kxd5 Bxe7 52.fxe7 Rxe7 53.Kd6 Due to black king's being position far from the center white suddenly obtained reasonable chances for survival 53...Re1 54.d5 Kf8 55.Ne6+ Ke8 56.Nc7+ Kd8 57.Ne6+ Kc8 58.Ke7\n59.Ng5? Striving for activity at any cost fails white It was necessary \"to stay and wait\": 59.Kd6 ] 59...b5 60.d6 Rd1 59...b5 60.d6 Rd1 61.Ne6 b4 62.Nc5 Re1 63.Kf6 Re3\nThe second game happened to be even more interesting than the first one and was passing by a similar scenario scenario. Just like in the first game, Topalov was again the one to seize the initiative, but Vladimir Kramnik defended good. The game turned out to be exclusively tense, and unusually big number of mistakes for players of such a level confirms this clearly. The voltage raised so high, that on moves 31-32 both opponents missed a simple move immediately leading to white's victory. As it often happens in such cases, the one to lose is the one who is the last to err. This time Vladimir Kramnik made mistakes more rarely than his opponent, he \"bore\" an unpleasant attack by his opponent and went on to win the second game in a row. I think, chess fans are delighted - such an acute fight tension hasn't been seen for already a long time. At least, the last match of Kramnik (against Peter Leko) is by far incomparable to the current one by the spectacularity: there are no bloodless draws, and it's very interesting to follow the games. I am sure we can expect the forthcoming struggle to be no less thrilling.","A stormy ferocious struggle where Topalov demonstrates his talent for conjuring up an attack from almost nothing. The game is peppered with queen sacrifices as well as rook and knight sacrifices. Somehow Kramnik defends just enough to delay Topalov’s coup de grace. In the complex position both sides make serious blunders. Topalov’s initiative finally runs out of steam, and Kramnik converts the complicated endgame. Kramnik now leads 2-0.\nOut of a classical Czech system of the Queens Gambit Slav, Kramnik plays an antiquated variation, and proceeds to button down the hatches on the kingside with 17… f5. After a surprisingly deep 19. Kh1, Topalov tears into Kramnik’s kingside with 20. g4!, and initiates a fierce struggle. Kramnik avoids tempting Topalov sacrificing a knight on e6 gets some active counterplay on the queenside that forces Topalov to retreat slightly. Just when Kramnik is on the verge of taking control of the game, Topalov plays an elegant and surprising 28. Qc2! followed by a sacrifice of his queen, the kingside threats reignites with elevated ferocity. In the complications that follow Kramnik blunders badly with 31… Bxf8?? gifting Topalov a straightforward path to victory, but Topalov returns the complement with a blunder of his own 32. Qg6+?? that luckily retains him a slight initiative in the complicated position. Topalov has some attacking chances in the dynamic unbalanced endgame. Kramnik, however, is merciless, and extracts the full point in the endgame.\nAn awesome performance from both players. Topalov’s imagination was the centre piece of this game, but right at the moment he should have collected the full point he stumbles. Although he played energetically throughout the game, Kramnik was remorseless – offering Topalov just one chance in the encounter.\n- Veselin Topalov (2813)\n- Vladimir Kramnik (2743)\n- Queens Gambit: Slav\n- World Championship 2006, Elista, Game 2\n- ECO Code\n10… Bxc3 11. bxc3 Nxe4 12.

{"question":"How do soil composition and carbon storage capabilities compare between forest ecosystems and agricultural soils, particularly in relation to their role in climate change mitigation?","answer":"According to the documents, soil is composed of approximately 45% minerals, 20-30% air, 20-30% water, and 5-10% organic matter. In forest ecosystems, soils store a significant 72% of the total carbon capture for a wood, while tree trunks, limbs, and leaves lock up 17%, roots 6%, and deadwood 5%. Healthy soil acts as one of the planet's third largest carbon sinks and continuously pulls carbon dioxide from the air, sequestering it in organic matter and humus. For agricultural soils, their carbon storage capability can be enhanced by increasing organic matter content, which also improves their Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC). Both types of soil benefit from increased organic matter, though forests, particularly those with broadleaf trees, are noted as being especially effective at carbon storage compared to conifer plantations, with UK woodland capturing 20 million tonnes of CO2 annually.","context":["Book Review: Grow Your Soil! by Diane Miessler\nHarness the Power of Microbes to Create Your Best Garden Ever\nStorey Publishing, January 2020\n- Price: $16.95\n- Size: 6 x 9\n- Pages: 176\n- Format: Paperback ISBN: 9781635862072\n- Other formats: Ebook\nGrow Your Soil! is an introduction to soil biology and gardening in eight chapters. It is written as if describing how to build a house (but starting with the roof!). Diane Miessler writes in plain English, with a light style, and her book has the endorsement of Elaine Ingham, who writes the foreword, saying that Diane’s humor and tongue-in-cheek joy make this book a joy to read. People were once told that using inorganic fertilizers and pesticides was the only way to grow enough food for a starving world. Elaine simply states “That was a flat-out lie.”\nDiane’s encouragement to garden in partnership with the soil food web lists the many benefits of a healthy environment, healthy flavorful food, and the satisfaction of doing what you believe is right. She has a ten-point list of suggestions for creating healthy living soil using no-till systems, lots of mulches, home-grown fertilizers, and by encouraging biodiversity. The fundamentals of soil science are explained – soil is about 45% minerals (sand, silt and clay), 20-30% air, 20-30% water and 5-10% organic matter. A teaspoon of good soil contains more microbes than there are people in the US, more species than all the vertebrates on Earth, several yards of fungal hyphae, a few thousand protozoa and several dozen nematodes (mostly good ones). Soil is our planet’s third largest carbon sink (after the oceans and fossil fuels). Healthy soil is continually pulling carbon dioxide from the air and sequestering it in the organic matter and humus. We want to have as much sequestered carbon as possible, both to reduce the amount in the atmosphere and so that we can use it to grow food.\nDiane’s mulch recommendations are to generally aim for a mix of one-third green matter (which feeds bacteria) and two-thirds brown (which feeds fungi), but steering towards more green matter for annual vegetables, more brown for woody perennials, in line with the predominant life-form each type of crop does best with.\nThe cover crops section first describes the plants, then how and when to use them. I had a brief worry that people would go out and plant buckwheat or sweet potatoes in winter, until I read on! In fact, Diane does suggest you can sow buckwheat whenever you like, and it will be dormant until the right spring weather occurs. In our central Virginia climate this does not work. Buckwheat seed rots in cold wet soil. Buckwheat can germinate in a warm early spring spell and be struck down by a following frost before it has made much growth at all. As always, it pays to discuss ideas you haven’t tried before with nearby gardeners.\nThis book has a good basic description of the Soil Food Web, for new gardeners or anyone who is a bit mystified about what’s happening in the soil. And for those over 50 whose biology classes only included the two plant and animal “kingdoms”, here are explanations of the classes of bacteria, fungi and archaea, the main types of soil microbes. Archaea are neither bacteria nor eukaryotes (tiny organisms that have their DNA in a nucleus). Archaea are similar to eukaryotes in some ways, but have more resistance to extreme conditions. In the soil they work as decomposers.\nNext up are the algae, protozoa and nematodes. The algae spectrum goes from one-celled photosynthesizing life-forms to giant kelp. In the soil they provide nutrients and increase plant resistance to diseases. Protozoa are one-celled animals, which release excess nutrients from their meals of bacteria and fungi, in a plant-available form. They help balance the numbers of bacteria in the soil. Nematodes are (mostly) microscopic roundworms that are mostly benign, from our perspective, and healthy populations keep the destructive nematodes in check. Arthropods (including insects, spiders, mites, ticks and scorpions) are shredders of organic matter in the soil (while eating smaller life-forms).\nBigger soil-dwellers include worms, slugs, snails, and small mammals. By the way, Diane explodes the myth that coffee grounds can control slugs, and claims to have videos to prove it untrue. And she tells us that fence lizards eat harlequin bugs. (I think she lives in California). Western fence lizards are centered in California, and according to the National Wildlife Federation, Eastern fence lizards are found between New York and northern Florida and as far west as Ohio and Arkansas. I want some!\nThe next section of the book explains Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), a measure of how many positively charged ions (cations, nutrients like Mg, K, Ca, ammonium) can be held by the negatively charge soil particles. Diane likens this to the pantry. Soils with a low CEC can’t hold many cations, and the key to increasing the CEC is to increase the soil organic matter content. Clay soils may have a high CEC, but the nutrients may be held too tightly to be useful to plants. The solution to this problem is also to increase the soil organic matter content.\nDiane offers several ways to increase the organic matter, and one of her favorites is biochar. Biochar in its original form is more or less sterile, not nutritious at all, but in the soil it can act like humus on steroids – it is very good at absorbing water, hosting microbes, reducing plant diseases and lasting a long time in the soil. I have been skeptical about some of the claims for biochar, and of the net gains in reducing global heating. Diane does not make any wild claims (she’s not selling the stuff). She is open about the fact that the mechanism for suppressing disease is not yet understood.\nAs I said, Diane is not selling biochar. In fact she describes how to make your own on a small scale with an “upside-down” outdoor fire (with all due safety precautions). Big pieces of wood are arranged on the ground in an open airy stack, and a small fire is lit on top with tinder and kindling. This means the fire produces little smoke (all smoke is air pollution). The fire is thoroughly doused with water once everything is glowing but not flaming. Those wanting to make biochar on a bigger scale are referred to a double-barrel biochar burner on YouTube.\nThe next section is on photosynthesis, minerals and soil testing. Diane describes the effects of too much, too little and just right amounts of the main soil nutrients first. A deficiency of phosphorus shows up as blue-purple colors on the older leaves. She doesn’t mention phosphorus surplus, although she does confirm that excess phosphorus added to the soil will usually be locked up and become inaccessible to plants. Potassium deficiency can cause yellow leaf edges. Next up are other macro-nutrients, such as Calcium, magnesium and sulfur. Calcium deficiency leads to stunted new growth, brown around the edges, perhaps with yellowing between the veins. Bulb and fruit formation can be damaged, as with blossom end rot of tomatoes, caused by insufficient calcium reaching the fruits. By contrast, a magnesium deficiency leads to older leaves becoming yellow between the veins and around the edges, perhaps with purple, reddish or brownish discoloration. Sulfur shortage can lead to “unthrifty” plants. Shortages of any of these can be remedied by the addition of more organic matter.\nMicronutrient shortages can also be helped by organic matter, although in Virginia I have noticed that we do sometimes need to add boron on its own (in tiny amounts).\nDiane describes how to test soil, understand the results, and remedy the situation. Try adding organic matter first, and only tinker with the specifics if the general remedy is not enough. For instance, if your soil biological activity is low, you may find that piling on organic matter doesn’t help. Use compost to add some more life to the soil and get a better balance of diners to dinners. There is a helpful one-page “Order of Operations for Fixing Soil”: Correct the pH; correct the calcium level; correct any excesses (usually by adding gypsum); correct the macronutrient deficiencies and lastly correct the micronutrient and trace element deficiencies. Clear instructions like this are so valuable to newer gardeners!\nThere is a chapter on making compost and compost tea. She suggests thinking of compost as a sourdough starter, and mulch as the flour. Both are valuable, and they work well together. Making good compost is a valuable skill to learn. Try for the a good balance of high nitrogen materials and high carbon materials, with enough water. Turn the pile, assess its progress, add what it seems to need. Rinse and repeat. Diane recommends against spending money on fancy compost bins. “Compost needs love, not a container.” There is value in turning the pile and seeing how it’s doing. If it’s fully enclosed in a tumbler, you might miss the signs that it needs a specific kind of care. Here is encouragement to learn the art and science of compost making.\nWorm bins are a great way to use kitchen scraps to produce worms and compost, especially in winter, as worm bins need to be in a non-freezing place to stay alive. I disagree with Diane about using the liquid leaching from the bottom of the bin as a “compost tea” See my review of The Worm Farmer’s Handbook by Rhonda Sherman. This liquid might not be good for your plants. To make compost tea, put some of the wormcastings in water and bubble air though it. Instructions are in Diane’s book a few pages later.\nAnother small industrious worker is the black soldier fly. The (harmless) maggots of these (harmless) flies will out-compete other (disease-carrying and/or biting) flies in eating up kitchen scraps in an odorless way. They are also a favorite food of poultry, and there are clever ways of setting up a bsf bin so that the pupal stage will “self-harvest” by walking up a ramp and dropping into a collecting box. See YouTube for all the details.\nAfter explaining these various aspects of growing good soil, Diane pulls everything together into a chapter on Building a Garden That Feeds Itself. Here you can learn about sprinkler irrigation, mulching, planting, and selecting good tools. The next chapter covers being a good neighbor, by having a good-looking, good-smelling, productive garden that gets frequent attention. Diane advocates for pulling weeds and dropping them on the bed, without worrying about weed seeds or plant diseases. I can see this would work best in a smaller garden where things don’t get out of control, and in drier climates with fewer diseases and less chance for weeds to re-root. There’s a panel about roses that I didn’t read. (Roses are a great trap crop for Japanese beetles; I’m not a flower grower!) A big help to beginners is the glossary at the end, and the bibliography of books on soil life.\nIf you are a beginner organic gardener, or you’re looking for a book for someone in that category, this book has a clear user-friendly approach. It won’t scare off newbies with too much detail.","Here are Jan Flamank's Nature Notes for October 2020. Click on each photo to see a larger photo in a new page. For downloadable pdf versions of each topic see the links below.\nThe Goldcrest is our smallest native bird, found mainly in coniferous woodland and often heard more than seen, as it is only up to 3.5 inches long and weighs less than a quarter of an ounce, or 5-7 g. It is always on the move in the dense foliage, well camouflaged as it flickers round the branches, hovering and picking insects and spiders from the tree. They can also hang upside down when searching for food beneath leaves, and have very sharp, thin beaks that act like tweezers. Usually well hidden in conifers, they sometimes visit the ground to peck seeds and insects from snow covered surfaces.\nWell named, it has a bright yellow or orange crown on the top of its head, bordered in black, and this bright crown is raised into a small crest when alarmed. They have a high pitched song and alarm call.\nWhat amazes me for such a tiny bird, is that in our autumn, our resident population can increase fivefold by large numbers of Goldcrests migrating across the North Sea to spend winter here. They fly here from the Baltic, Finland and even Russia, covering over 600 miles in one week.\nThey are effective breeding birds, with 2 broods a year of up to 20 nestlings in one season. They have also benefitted from widespread conifer plantations across the UK, with the fast growing trees used in lumber and paper production. Both parents make the small spherical nest, with 3 layers for insulation, made with cobwebs, lichen, moss and lined with feathers and hair. It is so small and well concealed in the dense foliage, it is rarely predated.\nThey feed all day in autumn, building up energy for the cooler nights, huddling together in thick cover to keep warm. I would love to see that! I have seen Goldcrests in conifer woodland, but it was mostly an impression of fluttering movements as they restlessly foraged for insects.\nThe Firecrest is another tiny bird, closely related to the Goldcrest, similarly secretive, but they do sometimes interbreed. Firecrests are less numerous here, but are found mainly in the South East. They migrate from central Europe, but prefer more open mixed woodland, and may also inhabit gardens with exotic conifers. When they feed together with Goldcrests they tend to feed lower down in the trees than the Goldcrest, so leaving space for each other to hopefully find enough food. Sensible and kind, this is a lovely lesson for us all from these very small birds.\nWe tend to think of hail as winter phenomenon, as it is ice, but in fact we always have hailstorms in the warmer summer months, so why is this?\nIt is all because the big convective clouds reach their highest elevation in summer, when the surface is strongly heated by the sun, and also when they have the most moisture in them, so evaporation is at a high rate too. Both of these occur in the summer months. The higher the clouds go, away from the warm surface of the earth, the colder they become.\nCumulonimbus clouds, which produce hail, are convective clouds, formed by warmer, summer air pulling away from the surface of the earth, contrasting with the relatively much cooler air above the cloud. The clouds form and transport heat up into the atmosphere by the process of convection, and the strong updraughts of ascending air, and downdraughts, enable hail to form inside the cloud.\nThese clouds contain large water droplets and hail forms within the cloud from tiny ice crystals called graupel. The hailstones become bigger inside the cloud, due to the accumulation of supercooled water droplets as they are borne upwards on rapidly rising air. The hailstones have to build up sufficient layers of ice to be heavy enough to fall out of the cloud onto earth. They do this by moving up and down in the cloud on the water- rich updraught, adding icy layers to themselves. It is possible to count the ice layers in a large hailstone and have an idea of how many times it moved up and down in the cloud.\nSo, the next time we have a summer hailstorm, think of the tiny ice crystals becoming larger as they move up and down in the cloud, encountering very cold water droplets and making extra layers of ice, prior to making headlines in the local news. It is a summer weather event to marvel at - buy try to avoid being out in it, as they can hurt if they land on your head!\nThis is our most tiny shrew, widespread throughout the UK and surprisingly resilient given its minute size. It is only 2.5 inches long, but its long hairy tail of 1.5 inches adds to the overall length.\nAs such a small warm bloodied mammal, it has a proportionately larger surface area than bigger mammals and so loses body heat quickly. Many mammals grow longer fur to combat the cold, but this tactic would hinder the movement of such a small creature, so after the moult in autumn, its fur stays at about 3mm long all over. We don’t know why it happens or how it is controlled, but the autumn moult starts on the rump, working up towards the long nose, but the spring moult does the reverse, starting at the nose then working towards the rump. Wild indeed.\nBeing so small has some advantages, and the pygmy shrew can hide effectively in a wide range of habitats, including fissures in rocky outcrops, but prefers long grass and shrubby vegetation in woodland where they can also easily feast on their prey. They mainly eat spiders, beetles, woodlice and snails and feed almost constantly, as they have to consume 25% more than their own weight every day, just to keep alive. That is a huge amount of tucker!\nLuckily, it has a very efficient digestive system, and excellent hearing that picks up the minute sounds of moving invertebrates. Their wonderfully long nose is covered with hairs that detect movements of prey in the undergrowth. Once they pounce on a spider or woodlice they bite it with teeth that are red at the tip, due to iron oxide in their enamel. Juicy snails also provide water for them. Pygmy shrews have a very high metabolic rate, with a heart rate of 250 beats per minute, and a breathing rate of 200 breaths a minute and live a short, fast life of only up to a year in the wild, with many dying within 4 months of birth.\nSolitary creatures apart from mating, they usually have 2 litters of 4 to 7 young, born mainly April to September. They grow rapidly on the rich milk of their mother, increasing their size 10 fold in just 2 weeks. They are independent at about 3 weeks old, and then leave the nest to establish their own territory. Wet and cold weather is the biggest cause of mortality, as they impede the shrew’s ability to keep warm and find enough food.\nWe are unlikely to see live pygmy shrews, who are themselves a tasty snack for owls, but the next time you walk near woodland or long grass, imagine them rushing about, foraging and feasting on small invertebrates, resting only in very short naps of a few minutes in their hidden undergrowth homes. And the proud possessors of red tipped teeth.....\nMost of us are much more aware now of the unavoidable fact that humans are by far the most destructive species on this planet. Thankfully, we are also more aware of what we can do to change our behaviours, rebalance our relationship with the natural world and repair some of the damage we have done.\nAn important concern with regard to increasing global warming is the vital issue of carbon capture and the role of trees. As with all these complex environmental challenges, our responses need to be equally multifaceted and thought through to ensure long term benefits. We can do this.\nHigh quality research is ongoing in the UK and beyond, and the Woodland Trust and Wildlife Trusts are doing fantastic work on our responses, along with many environmentalists, Defra and other organisations. This all helps, a lot.\nWe know that trees are excellent at capturing and storing carbon, but which are the best and how can we intelligently plan ahead to reduce climate change and restore some of the vast losses of natural habitats for wildlife? It is not enough to just pledge to plant vast numbers of trees in the UK. We need to know what to plant, where to plant and to avoid the mistakes we made with huge conifer plantations. We must also stop stripping the soil of all its nutrients with chemicals and overgrazing. As I have said before, many times, if we have poor soil, we cannot have healthy plants and without plants, we will ultimately, have nothing....\nSo, a huge challenge faces us, but we have reflection, intelligence (with notable well known exceptions!) and environmental sciences to help us plan well and make a real, positive difference. Phew.\nHere are some useful facts about carbon capture from the Woodland Trust:\nBroadleaf trees are better at storing carbon than conifers, with beech trees in the top 5 for locking up destructive CO 2. This is due to their high timber density. Fast growing conifers are good for easy financial gain, but not for long term sustainability, eco -diversity and reducing climate change. Soils store a huge 72% of the total carbon capture for a wood, with tree trunks, limbs and leaves locking up 17%, tree roots 6% and deadwood 5%.UK woodland captures 20million tonnes of CO 2 annually, and we can improve on this by planting trees most effectively across our small island.\nWe may not all have the resources or space to contribute to mass tree planting, but we are all aware of the small, incrementally useful things we can do to help now:\nIf you have a garden, or community space, plant a new tree if you can. Autumn is the best time to do this, when the earth is still warm and the trees have time to establish before new growth in the springtime. Think small and native, and make a square planting hole as the roots establish more firmly than in a round one. Ensure it is well watered in the first few years of growth.\nAll the usual daily eco-helpers of reduce, reuse, recycle to avoid waste.\nDon’t fly! Leave that to our perfectly adapted feathered friends, but do put out some sustaining seeds and water for them throughout the cooler months.\nEnjoy the glorious colours of autumn as our broadleaf trees lose their leaves and prepare for a period of dormancy over winter.\nIf you get the chance, read The Hidden Life of Trees by Peter Wohlleben, an inspiring book for the longer evenings.\n© Jan Flamank October 1st 2020.

{"question":"How does psychological assessment benefit diagnostic processes, and what legal requirements exist for insurance coverage of autism treatment?","answer":"Psychological assessment allows evaluators to corroborate interview data and collect broader, in-depth information with a normative, statistical scientific basis that compares individuals against samples of normal and clinically disordered individuals. It also includes validity scales to assess honest versus defensive responses. Regarding insurance coverage for autism, all states now have meaningful legislation requiring funding for autism treatments, particularly behavioral therapy, and in some cases speech, occupational and physical therapies. The coverage requirements vary by state, but must comply with mental health parity laws that prevent insurers from imposing more restrictive limitations on mental health services than medical services.","context":["We provide an array of clinical services, including:\n- Psychiatric Evaluations – psychiatric and diagnostic evaluation, poly-pharmacy/poly-psychotropic evaluations, psychiatric consultation, determine diagnostics and medical necessity, initial psychiatric treatment recommendations\n- Medication Management – symptom management through psychotropic medications including, anti-depressants, anxiolytics and benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, mood stabilizers, anticonvulsants, psychostimulants\n- Medication Review – monitoring response to medications\n- Psychiatric Consultation – evaluate a case for second opinion or assist other professionals (schools, jails, court system, other physicians)\nPsychiatry services are highly effective and essential for many moderate to severe cases.

Helps to define and understand personality, behavior, emotions, intelligence, and how they come together. Such assessments help to answer diagnostic questions, to specify a person’s strengths, weaknesses and personality structure, and to explain and to predict behavior.\nWe provide Autism Assessments.\nAssessment for treatment planning, suitability for medication referral\nChildren and Adolescents\n- Assessment of : behavior and mood problems, academic and learning problems, separation anxiety and other anxiety disorders, stress reaction to trauma and abuse, childhood ADHD, alcohol and drug problems, developmental and autism spectrum disorders\n- Diagnostic Interviews: semi-structured and structured diagnostic interviews\n- Psychological Testing: cognitive and achievement testing, assessment of adaptive skills, assessment of behavior, emotional and thinking problems\n- ADOS Assessments: The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) is a semi-structured assessment of communication, social interaction, and play (or imaginative use of materials) for individuals suspected of having autism or other pervasive developmental disorders.\n- Assessment of: depression and mood problems, anxiety and phobic, chronic interpersonal discord and conflict, major neurocognitive problems, severe personality disorder, psychotic and other severe psychological problems, substance use problems, trauma and stress\n- Diagnostic Interviews: semi-structured and structured interviews designed to determine diagnostics\n- Psychological Testing: personality assessment, evaluation of adult ADHD and learning disabilities, mood and anxiety disorders, thought disorder, objective and projective testing.\nBenefits of Psychological Assessment:\n- Assessment which includes psychological testing allows the evaluator to corroborate interview data and clinical impressions and to go beyond the interview and collect broader, in-depth, and more complex kinds of information.\n- Standardized psychological assessment has a normative, statistical scientific basis. It compares the individual against data collected in samples of normal and clinically disordered individuals. It allows the evaluator to determine how similar or dissimilar this person is to persons in these samples.\n- Individuals may attempt to “look good” or “look bad” in interview depending on the case. Therefore, most test instruments contain (multiple) validity scales on which to assess the extent to which the individual is providing honest, candid, defensive, socially desirable, or exaggerated depictions of their psychological health or symptoms.","Laws which Offer autism and Mental Health Protections to Consumers\nWHAT IS THE FEDERAL MENTAL HEALTH PARITY AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT?\nThe Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (MHPAEA), is a federal law that was enacted in order to address health insurance practices that unfairly limited coverage for mental illness and substance abuse. Generally, the law requires that if plans offer mental health benefits, the financial requirements and treatment limitations for mental health or substance use can be no more restrictive than the predominant financial requirements or treatment limitations applied to substantially all medical and surgical benefits covered by the plan and there are no separate treatment limitations that are applicable only with respect to mental health or substance use disorder benefits.\nThe law applies to nearly all private health plans, including those that are self-funded, fully funded, and individual plans bought on or off the exchange. The law extended to the individual and small group market through the Affordable Care Act. The law does not apply to:\nIn 2016, a Federal Mental Health Parity Task Force issued a report to President Obama which included many recommendations on implementation and enforcement of the Federal Mental Health Parity Act. One of the recommendations included tracking consumer complaints related to mental health and substance abuse. The Kennedy Forum has taken the initiative to track this information and share it with legislators and policy makers. If you (or a loved one or a client) have been denied a mental health treatment, please consider reporting your experiences here.\n1. Benefit Classifications: All health care benefits are categorized into six benefit classifications. Services for MH/SUD must be at parity with medical/surgical benefits in each of these categories:\nFor example, if a plan requires prior authorization requirements for behavior treatment for autism, or intensive outpatient therapy for mental health, they must require pre-authorization requirements for substantially all medical/surgical treatments.\n2. Consumer Cost-Sharing and Treatment Limitations: Consumer cost-sharing such as co-pays, deductibles or co-insurance and treatment limitations cannot be more restrictive or burdensome for MH/SUD than for medical or surgical benefits.\nFor example, if a health plan allows unlimited outpatient medical visits per year, it cannot limit MH/SUD outpatient visits to a specified amount.\n3. Nonquantitative Treatment Limitations: NQTLs applied to MH/SUD can be no more restrictive than treatment limitations applied to substantially all medical and surgical benefits covered by the plan and there are no separate treatment limitations that are applicable only with respect to mental health or substance use disorder benefits.\nSome examples of NQTLs may be found here , and include:\nFor example, a plan cannot exclude coverage for inpatient, out-of-network treatment of substance abuse disorders when obtained outside of the State, if there is no similar exclusion for medical or surgical benefits within the same classification. Similarly, a plan cannot require Joint Commission Accreditation for Mental Health Facilities but not for medical facilities within the same class.\nAn example of Fail-first/step therapy protocols that we see frequently are denials for residential treatment if clients have not previously tried partial hospital or intensive outpatient. Plans cannot do that if they do not make similar requirements on the medical/surgical side.\nThe law also states that there are no separate treatment limitations that are applicable only to MH or SUD benefits. Examples of these that we see all the time are exclusions for specific types of evidence based mental health treatments that do not have direct analogs on the medical/surgical side, including:\n4. Transparency of Health Plan Information: For any denial of service, the plan must include in writing the reason for the denial (if it is not medically necessary, the plan must say why), and steps on how to appeal. They also must make available to you criteria used in making their decision.\n5. Out-of-Network Benefits: Access to out-of-network MH/SUD services cannot be more difficult or restrictive than it is for medical or surgical services.\nAs of this writing, all states have meaningful legislation or regulation that requires funding for autism treatments. Nearly all address behavioral therapy, and some include requirements around speech, occupational and physical therapies as well. Not all autism laws are the same, and it is important to understand the law governing your state. For a list of autism laws by state and what they cover, click here.\nThe Kennedy Forum offers a state by state analysis of mental health parity legislation and regulation. To see what protections are available by state, click here. Don’t be too discouraged if your state got an F, as they are in good company. It is more important to understand the protections offered.\nIn California, there is a law in place called AB 88, also known as the California Mental Health Parity Act of 2000. This law requires coverage for the diagnosis and medically necessary treatment of the following \"severe mental illnesses\" in parity with other medical conditions:\nCalifornia’s active autism mandate, AB 796, can be found here.\nIt has no restrictions on age, or caps on visits or annual spending. Unfortunately, this state mandate does not apply to Medi-Cal. Children on Medi-Cal are able to access ABA services through interpretation of federal Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) law. Effective 2014, services were available to those with autism, under age 21. Effective 2018, services were expanded to include other conditions, when medically necessary and recommended by a physician or a psychologist. At this time, these services are only available for those under age 21.\nThe SED qualification can be used for children who do not have a formal \"severe mental illness\" diagnosis or ASD diagnosis, but are experiencing many similar challenges to justify the need for behavior treatment, residential treatment, or other intensive type treatment.\nIt is important to note that the CA Mental Health Parity Act entitles you to a diagnostic evaluation if there is a suspicion of any of the above listed conditions. Your primary care provider can authorize this. The plan is still responsible for this evaluation even if the child is later found not to have any of the above listed conditions.\nIt is also important to know that due to significant litigation (Harlick v Blue Shield of CA and Rea vs Blue Shield of CA), the CA parity act requires that all medically necessary treatment be provided to those that meet its criteria. This argument has been used to prevent health plans from enforcing categorical denials for things like wilderness therapy, residential treatment, and other evidence based treatments for autism/mental health conditions.\nBoth Massachusetts and NY have laws which require that the health plan or insurance company make a determination within required timelines for both expedited and standard appeals. Failure to adhere to the timelines shall be deemed to be a reversal of the health plan’s adverse determination. Laws in both states apply to fully funded plans.\nThe state of Oregon has a law which allows the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services to seek restitution on a consumer’s behalf for the actual damages the consumer suffered as a result of the insurer’s violation of state or federal law, or breach of contract."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9c5d3720-fecd-45d6-aa5b-308cff0b2bb3>","<urn:uuid:ce381ba1-c141-4f04-b2c2-69f3c31025bc>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm interested in health and safety measures - what's the relationship between workplace COVID-19 protective measures and recommendations for reducing prolonged sitting risks?","answer":"Both issues require similar approaches of regular interruptions to normal working patterns. For COVID-19, workplaces implemented staggered working hours, social distancing, and PPE provision. For prolonged sitting, research shows harmful metabolic changes can be prevented by introducing light-intensity activity breaks every 20-30 minutes - even just 2 minutes of slow walking can have beneficial effects. However, compliance has been problematic in both cases - many workplaces lacked access to adequate PPE and had overcrowded conditions increasing COVID-19 risk, while sitting-related risks often persist due to workers being 'too busy' to take regular standing breaks despite health guidelines.","context":["This report provides a rapid global assessment of the major impacts of Covid-19 on modern slavery and identifies good practices in protecting its victims and affected workers. It also proposes guiding principle for addressing modern slavery during future crises.\nThe research team comprised of Prof. Tomoya Obokata and Dr Forough Ramezankhah from Keele University; and Rasha Al Saba and Samrawit Gougsa from Minority Rights Group.\nThis research was based on desktop analysis of emerging academic literature reports and data provided by governments, civil society organisations, trade unions, regional and international organisations, and media reports where appropriate; complemented by a series of semi-structured interviews with over 30 non-governmental stakeholders working in the areas of modern slavery and workers’ rights.\nImpacts of Covid-19 on modern slavery\n1. Disruption of anti-slavery actions\nThe project discovered that investigations, prosecutions and punishments of modern slavery, including labour inspections and court proceedings, have been disrupted or delayed in a number of states and territories. Protection of people who experienced modern slavery has been affected globally, with provision of face-to-face services has been largely halted, and the most vulnerable populations particularly affected.\n2. Increased vulnerabilities\nThe pandemic has made people more vulnerable to modern slavery. Unemployment has been pushing affected workers into the informal and illegal economies, characterised by precariousness and lack of sufficient protection from governments. An increase in demand for labour in some sectors has enabled exploitation and abuse of workers. Temporary school closures have resulted in the growth of child labour, forced marriage, and online child sexual exploitation.\nGood practice in protecting the victims of modern slavery and workers affected by the pandemic\n1. Anti-slavery actions\nMany governments have continued their law enforcement responses and protection of victims, whilst civil society organisations have been playing a crucial role in protecting victims.\n2. Mitigating unemployment\nGood practices in mitigating unemployment caused during the pandemic are emerging, with job retention through wage subsidies, cash transfers and other support provided to vulnerable populations.\n3. Improving working and living conditions\nMeasures to improve working conditions have been facilitated, particularly around health and safety measures such staggered working hours, social distancing and provision of PPE, as well as financial support schemes have been provided to those who contracted the virus.\nCritical analysis of emerging good practice\n1. Anti-slavery actions\nThe project discovered that there still is scope for improvement, as the support given to individuals during the pandemic has been insufficient.\n2. Support for unemployed workers\nMuch of economic and social assistance for unemployed workers was temporary and the level of support has been regarded as inadequate in all regions of the world.\n3. Vulnerable groups particularly affected\nThe most affected and vulnerable populations have been excluded from support and assistance one way or another, for example by job retention schemes mainly applying to the formal sector and therefore excluding informal workers. Other reasons include lack of effective mechanisms to distribute support, and inability to register beneficiaries properly, which have made it difficult for groups such as women, young people, migrant workers, minorities or displaced persons to benefit from available support.\n4. Working and living conditions\nLiving and working conditions have been affected, for instance, lack of access to PPE at workplaces or overcrowded accommodation for workers increasing the risk of Covid-19 infection. Many issues stem from a lack of effective legislative and other measures, including robust labour inspections or businesses not complying with official guidance.\n5. Activities of civil society organisations and trade Unions\nActivities of civil society organisations and trade unions have been affected globally, from difficulties in providing face-to-face services, to experiencing harassment and intimidation.\nGuiding principles on actions against modern slavery in emergency situations\nInternational human rights law, international labour law and other relevant branches of international law impose clear legal obligations on States to continue anti-slavery actions in emergency situations, using the following principles:\nPrinciple 1: Human rights must be at the centre of actions against modern slavery in emergency situations.\nPrinciple 2: States must continue to investigate, prosecute and punish modern slavery in emergency situations.\nPrinciple 3: Law enforcement against modern slavery during emergency situations must be conducted in accordance with the existing human rights norms and principles.\nPrinciple 4: Financial investigations and confiscation of criminal proceeds generated from modern slavery must be an integral part of anti-slavery responses.\nPrinciple 5: States must continue to identify and protect the victims of modern slavery during emergency situations.\nPrinciple 6: States must ensure that businesses and employers respect and protect human rights during emergency situations.\nPrinciple 7: States must ensure access to justice and remedies through legislative, administrative, judicial and other means.\nPrinciple 8: In facilitating effective protection, States should cooperate actively with civil society organisations and trade unions.\nPrinciple 9: States should improve the working and living conditions of workers.\nPrinciple 10: States must continue to prevent modern slavery during emergency situations.\nPrinciple 11: International cooperation and solidarity are crucial in continuing anti-slavery actions during emergency situations.","For decades, we have been hearing about the health benefits of living a physically active lifestyle. But what about the times when we are not moving a lot; travelling to work, hours at work spent sitting, and the post-work couch time devoted to relaxing? As long as we make time for physical activity each day, we get a free pass to sit in our remaining hours, correct? Unfortunately research is beginning to show that the answer to that question is a resounding no.\nThe dangers of prolonged sitting is centred on its sedentary behaviour. Sedentary behaviour refers to ‘any waking behaviour characterised by an energy expenditure ≤1.5 METs while in a sitting or reclining posture’ (Sedentary Behaviour Research Network, 2012). This is conceptually different from ‘physical inactivity’, which is the lack of sufficient moderate/ vigorous intensity physical activity, and therefore both need to be considered as separate health hazards (Sedentary Work – Safe Work Australia, 2016).\n“Sedentary behaviour refers to ‘any waking behaviour characterised by an energy expenditure ≤1.5 METs while in a sitting or reclining posture’\nOverall exposure to sedentary behaviour (especially prolonged, unbroken sitting time) is shown to be detrimentally associated with a range of poor health outcomes, including; musculoskeletal problems, cardio-metabolic outcomes (including cardiovascular disease, diabetes and obesity), some cancers, mental ill health and health related quality of life. Furthermore, data also demonstrates a dose–response association between sitting time and all-cause mortality, independent of leisure time physical activity. As such, the simple pleasure of sitting for prolonged periods is deemed more of a risk factor for preventable morbidity and mortality in Australia than high cholesterol and is just behind high blood pressure on the risk scale.\nIn terms of energy expenditure, there is a relatively small differential between sitting and static standing. However, during standing, postural muscles (predominately those of the lower limbs) are continually contracting in order to keep the body upright and prevent loss of balance. Frequent contractions in these large muscle groups are largely absent while sitting. This can lead to an adverse metabolic profile with suppression of hormones related to fat metabolism and reduced glucose uptake by skeletal muscles, which can lead to insulin resistance. It is important to note that these sedentary metabolic changes do not appear to exist when incidental, light-intensity activity (including standing) is introduced every 20-30 minutes (Sedentary Work – Safe Work Australia, 2016).\nWhat research is currently illustrating is that sitting too much is not the same as exercising too little.\nBut before you all go out and ditch your chair, the question is….how much sitting is too much? Findings suggest that – at least for mortality outcomes in adults – excessive can be considered somewhere near a 7 hour daily threshold without 30 minute mini-breaks (self-reported) (J.Y. Chau et al, 2013; Sedentary Work – Safe Work Australia, 2016). Interrupting prolonged periods of sitting every 20-30 minutes is supported by epidemiological studies and even as little as 2 minutes of light intensity activity (e.g. slow walking) may be sufficient for beneficial metabolic effects (Dunstan et al, 2012; Sedentary Work – Safe Work Australia, 2016).\nSo what can you do to limit your sitting? The simple answer is to stand up more often. Standing more could be as simple as standing up to take phone calls or to adopt the habit of standing meetings. Effectively, trying to stand up every half hour or so for a minute or 2 may well be the best daily medicine you can take.\nPlease browse our other blogs for further information on how to gradually start implementing standing/ introducing a sit to stand workstation within your working environment and other steps that can be taken to reduce the negative health consequences of sitting for prolonged periods of time.\nMOVING MORE @ WORK – REDUCE YOUR SITTING TIME\nERGONOMICS OF A STANDING WORKSTATION\n- Changing excessive sitting behaviours is an individual, organisational and national priority\n- Prolonged sitting is associated with significant negative health outcomes\n- Sedentary behaviour and physical inactivity are separate entities and risk factors associated with prolonged sitting (being ‘too busy’ to take a break) are NOT negated by current physical activity guidelines (moderate exercise 30 minutes a day)\n- The harm associated with prolonged occupational sitting is likely due to insufficient movement and energy expenditure, lack of postural variety, diminished gravitational resistance, and a number of other mechanisms\n- Small and frequent interruptions from sitting (every 20-30 minutes) and less total time sitting can start to mitigate the potential harm"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0e2da960-9f21-4078-a8db-d3110c896059>","<urn:uuid:36d44084-93d6-47fb-9c31-65d719d76f14>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do oxidation prevention methods work in metal processing, and what are the key challenges in refractory material maintenance?","answer":"In metal processing, oxidation prevention primarily relies on protective anti-scale coating that creates a barrier between oxygen and metal surfaces. This coating is applied to billets or ingots before charging them into furnaces, resulting in substantial reduction of oxidation and scale loss. The coating is typically applied by brushing, spraying, or dipping, and has been shown to reduce mill scale by approximately 70% in stainless steel processing. As for refractory material maintenance, several challenges exist. One significant issue is alkali hydrolysis, which can occur in lightweight castables due to the reaction of carbon dioxide with lime in the cement, causing surface layers to become friable and delaminate. Additionally, refractory materials must be properly maintained through careful dryout processes, as improper treatment can lead to issues like spalling - a mechanical failure resulting in cracks, fractures, delamination, or explosive failure, particularly during the dryout process when water converts to steam.","context":["How to increase yield and save costs\nin hot rolling and hot forging?\nS. P. Shenoy\nM.Tech. (Met. Engg.), C.E.O.,\nSteel Plant Specialities LLP, India.\nThis article introduces a practical technique pioneered by a metallurgist from the Indian Institute of Technology. The technique enables reduction of burning loss or mill scale, and increasing yield in most kinds of steels. The technique is most successfully adopted in open die hot forging and hot rolling of stainless steel and other expensive alloy steels.\nIn open die forging and hot rolling and even closed die forging of Stainless Steels and alloy steels, the major factor accounting for reduced yield is ‘burning loss’ or ‘scale loss’ or ‘mill scale’ caused due to Oxidation. Oxidation and decarburization of steel take place when billets or ingots are heated in a billet re-heating furnace, in the presence of air or products of combustion. Apart from burning loss of between 1.5% up to 4%, oxidation leads to numerous other problems like scale pit marks, bad quality surface finish of metal, rejections, cumbersome task of removal of mill scale and increased expensive operations like grinding, acid pickling, etc.\nThis article introduces a practical technique pioneered by an experienced Metallurgist from the Indian Institute of Technology (I.I.T.). The technique enables any kind of steel to be heated by substantially minimizing the problem of oxidation.\nUNDERSTANDING BURNING LOSS DUE TO OXIDATION\nFor the purpose of hot rolling, when billets or ingots are heated in an open furnace in the presence of air or products of combustion, the surface phenomena of oxidation takes place. Oxidation causes immediate corrosion of steel at high temperature and creates a layer of metal-oxide, or mill scale, on the surface of the billets or ingots. Decarburisation is a simultaneous reaction that takes place along with oxidation. However, this decarburization is limited to certain grades of steel only.\nOxidation of steel is caused by oxygen, carbon dioxide and/or water-vapour. The general reactions are given below :\nOxidation of steel may range from a tight, adherent straw-coloured film that forms at a temperature of about 180°C to a loose, blue-black oxide scale that forms at temperature above about 450°C with resultant loss of metal or reduced yield.\nHARMFUL EFFECTS OF OXIDATION\nOxidation leads to loss of dimensions and material as extra material allowance needs to be kept for scaling. Often, surface quality is deteriorated due to scale-pitting. This is especially true in the case of Nickel bearing grades of steel.\nThroughout the industry, this burning loss or scale loss is simply treated as wastage and not many practical solutions are available to stop or reduce this wastage. Problems like thick adherent scaling or scale pit marks or decarburization are dealt by manually grinding off the scale or decarburized layer after the hot forging or hot rolling process.\nPREVENTING OR REDUCING BURNING LOSS DUE TO OXIDATION\nPrevention or substantial reduction of oxidation is not only better than cure, it is profitable too. However, most of the available solutions pose a number of practical difficulties. Capital-intensive special furnaces and availability of human resource for using these high-end furnaces is a major issue. Many small hot rolling Organizations cannot afford these solutions. Yet they are under mounting pressure to increase yield and reduce costs. Use of protective anti-scale coating has proven to be a logical solution to the problem of scaling and decarburization in open die hot forging and hot rolling.\nCHARACTERISTICS OF PROTECTIVE COATING AND ITS USE:\nUse of protective coating has been found beneficial and cost-effective. An anti-scale coating is applied on billets / ingots to be heated, before charging them into furnace. This anti-scale protective coating acts as a barrier between oxygen and metal. Care is taken to apply a uniform, impervious layer of coating on the billet to be heated. Coating ensures substantial reduction of oxidation, and thereby reduction in burning loss or mill scale. Anti-scale coating also reduces decarburization on billets during hot rolling operations. Heat transfer from heating media to metal is not affected due to anti-scale protective coating.\nNo reaction with steel surface, no release of toxic fumes during use or hot forging or storage, non-hazardous and economical implementation are other required characteristics of the coating.\nAdjoining photograph shows coated stainless steel ingot before being charging into furnace. Coating may be applied by brushing, spraying or dipping.\nINCREASING YIELD BY THE USE OF PROTECTIVE ANTI-SCALE COATING; INDUSTRIAL CASE STUDIES AND SUCCESS STORIES.\nDue to reduction in oxidation by the use of protective anti-scale coating during hot forging and hot rolling, the scale thickness is considerably reduced. Adjoining photographs are of mill scale that were generated on billets during re-heating for hot rolling with and without using protective\nThin, loose scale is observed on billets when protective coating is used.\nWhite layer of coating residue is observed on scale. This indicates efficacy of coating.\nThick adherent scale is observed on billets when coating is not used.\nThickness of mill scale fallen off both, coated and not coated billets, is measured using digital vernier calliper. As shown in image, scale of much lower thickness of 0.717 mm is generated on billets that were protected using anti-scale coating. In comparison, billets that were not protected and were charged in the same batch of heating have shown thicker and more adherent scale of 1.667 mm.\nTotal reduction in scale: 0.95 mm.\nPercentage reduction in mill scale loss due to use of protective anti-scale coating: 56.98%\nOn an average, approximately 70% reduction in mill scale is usually achieved by the use of anti-scale protective coating in open die hot forging and hot rolling of stainless steel. This amounts to lucrative savings and increased yield.\nAnother report of a number of mild-steel billets hot rolled without coating in comparison with hot rolling similar billets with single coating and double coating of anti-scale protection is provided below:\nScale loss of 1.140 kgs. was observed on billets with double layer of protective anti-scale coating.Scale loss of 2.140 kgs. was observed on billets without coating.\nPercentage reduction in mill scale loss due to use of protective anti-scale coating: 47.00%\nOTHER BENEFITS OF USING PROTECTIVE ANTI-SCALE COATING IN STAINLESS STEEL HOT ROLLING AND OPEN DIE FORGING:\n- REDUCTION IN GRINDING, ACID PICKLING TIME OF HOT ROLLED PRODUCTS:\nOperations like grinding, acid pickling, etc. do not add value, are expensive and time consuming procedures. These operations are necessary to remove adherent scaling from the hot rolled billets. Time required for operations like shot blasting, grinding, acid pickling, etc. can be substantially reduced if protective anti scale coating is applied on components before heat treatment. Aesthetic appeal of components is automatically enhanced without much effort as scaling is either prevented or reduced by the use of anti oxidation protective coating.\n- REDUCED DECARBURIZATION DURING HOT ROLLING & HOT FORGING :\nCertain grades like spring steels, ball bearing steel and rail steel are susceptible to decarburisation. During hot rolling of these special grades, decarburization needs to be consistently maintained to the required specification. However, due to unforeseen conditions like mill breakdown and unplanned downtime, billets remain in the furnace for longer time than usual. Also, when the plant is closed for weekly holiday, furnace is shut off abruptly, subjecting the billets to prolonged heating inside the furnace. If billets are not coated, it becomes difficult to guarantee the consistency in the decarburization level. Use of protective coatings on billets before charging them into the re-heating furnace enables to maintain the decarburization level consistently. This enables the hot rolling mill to guarantee their customers that decarburization level will always be less than the upper control limit.\nReduced decarburization on automobile leaf springs leads to increased fatigue strength of the leaf springs and greater reliability. Leaf springs heated after applying protective coating show substantially reduced decarburization and scaling.\n- IMPROVING SURFACE FINISH OF HOT ROLLED COMPONENTS AND PREVENTING WELDING OF BILLETS DURING HEATING:\nDuring hot rolling of special grades of steel like Nickel (Ni) and 416 Stainless Steel containing high sulphur content, mill scale is greatly increased. Surface finish of hot rolled product may be compromised due to scale pits and rolled-in scale. Occasionally, due to heavy adherent scale, problem of roll skid is also encountered. Subsequent grinding operations are increased due to excessive mill scale. Protecting the billets with anti-scale protective coating before charging them into the re-heating furnace ensures reduced oxidation and mill scale. Coating the billets before charging them into the reheating furnace enables to achieve good surface finish of the hot rolled products free from scale pits and rolled-in scale.\nPhotograph shows not coated billet on conveyor, discharged from furnace and passed through water de-scaler. As thick, adherent scale was formed, water de-scaling has not been effective. Adherent scale is observed on the top surface and some adherent scale on the left side surface.\nPhotograph shows anti-scale coated billet on conveyor, discharged from furnace and passed through water de-scaler. As thin, loose scale was formed, complete scale has fallen off during water de-scaling.\nThis proves that scale loss is reduced. Ease of rolling operation and reduced scale deposits on the rolling mill machinery are ensured.\nDuring re-heating of billets for hot rolling and also during induction heating of billets for hot forging, sometimes, billets get welded together. This leads to unproductive process of separating the welded billets and downtime. Welding of billets during hot rolling and hot forging can be prevented by applying protective coating on billets before charging them into the furnace.\n- IMPROVING SURFACE FINISH OF SEAMLESS PIPES:\nIn the manufacture of seamless pipes, machined hollow ingots are used in many places, especially in Poland. It becomes a necessity to protect the surface by protective coating when the ingot is reheated. This ensures better surface finish of the seamless pipe. This is achieved by the use of anti-scale protective coatings.\n- 70% average reduction in burning loss or mill scale loss and increased yield in stainless steel open die forging and hot rolling is possible by the use of protective anti-scale coating.\n- Protecting billets by applying anti-scale coating on them ensures a number of additional benefits like elimination or reduction of operations like grinding, acid pickling, etc., reduced decarburization, prevention of billet welding in furnace and improved surface finish.","Alkali Hydrolysis – A failure mechanism that can occur in lightweight castables due to the reaction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere with lime in the cement. Typically, surface layers of the refractory become friable and delaminate. The failure occurs when the refractory is exposed to certain environmental conditions after placement and when some time passes before dryout. One of the most effective preventative measures is to conduct a timely refractory dryout.\nBake Out – This term is sometimes used to refer to a refractory dryout.\nBulk Density – A quality measure used for refractory. It is the weight of an object divided by the volume that it occupies. In refractory, bulk density can be reduced by excess porosity.\nBurnout Fibers – Refractory manufacturers often create intentional porosity and permeability in their materials by including fibers in the mix that will burn out (and leave voids) at low temperatures.\nBurner Turndown Capability – This is the ratio of the maximum firing rate of a burner divided by its minimum firing rate. Many pre-mix process burners have a turndown capability of 3 to 1.\nCastable Refractories – A mixture of heat-resistant aggregate materials and heat-resistant hydraulic cement. It is typically mixed with water in order to be placed by casting, ramming or gunning. Castable refractories can be installed in the field to conform to the shape of the furnace, vessel, trough, cyclone or duct.\nCeramic Bond – The mechanical strength in refractory that is developed during heat treatment and is the result of cohesion between adjacent aggregate particles.\nCirculating Fluidized Bed Boiler (CFB) – This technology suspends particles of fuel and limestone in a stream of air in order to create efficient low temperature burning and to limit the generation of pollutants such as NOX and SO2. This technology has environmental advantages and flexibility on the quality of the fuel.\nChecker Burnout – A term used by some to refer to the sulfate burnout process for opening clogged regenerators on a glass furnace.\nChemical Cleaning – A commissioning process used in the start up of new boilers. Various cleaning and passivating fluids are temperature controlled and circulated thru the boiler tubes in order to clean and condition them before being placed into service.\nCoating Cure – Various coatings are used in industrial processes to reduce corrosion attack and/or to change the emissivity of a surface. Frequently these coatings are applied wet and need to be dried and cured before being placed into service.\nCold Crushing Strength (CCS) – This is a quality measure of a refractory that measures its resistance to compressive forces.\nCold Water Glass Furnace Drain (CWD) – At the end of a glass furnace campaign, the liquid glass in the furnace must be removed in order to enable repairs to the refractory. One method for removing the liquid glass is to drill a hole in the furnace and drain the hot glass into a water stream that will quench it and transport it to a storage area. In a cold water drain, the water is used in a “once thru” manner.\nCrown Rise Monitor (CRM) – When heating up a glass furnace, the refractory expands and the steel restraining structure must be adjusted to accommodate the expansion. In order to monitor and control this process, it is beneficial to measure the position of the refractory crown on the furnace. Traditionally this has been done by manually measuring “tell-tales” that compare the crown position to its original elevation. Crown Rise Monitor (CRM) uses linear position transducers and a data recorder to continuously monitor the position of the crown.\nCullet – Broken fragments of glass collected either as a byproduct of glass manufacture or as a result of post consumer recycling. This material is frequently used as a raw material in glass manufacturing.\nCullet Filling – When a glass furnace is first put into production, it is heated and must have an initial charge of glass to begin the production process. Cullet filling is often used to provide this initial charge. Cullet is frequently charged into the hot furnace either by blowing or vibrating it into the melter.\nExcess Air Burner – This style of burner does not try to maintain a fixed ratio of fuel to combustion air. It has the advantage of providing a high volume and low temperature stream of gas at the burner discharge nozzle when turned down to low firing rates. This functionality is particularly well suited to refractory dryout.\nExpansion Control Supervision (ECS) – During the heatup of a glass furnace, the refractory is contained by a steel structure and large adjustment bolts. As the furnace heats up and expands, the steel structure must be adjusted to accommodate the growth of the refractory. Expansion Control Supervision is a service provided to manage these adjustments.\nFreeze Protection – On occasion, critical assets must be protected from freezing due to environmental conditions. Usually these issues arise either during construction or during an extended outage. Freeze protection is a service that can be used to protect critical assets during cold weather.\nFurnace Heatup – Many industrial furnaces recycle waste heat and they rely on that recycled heat to sustain the process. Stoves, regenerators, checkers, and recuperators are all examples of technologies used to recycle process heat. When one of these process is completely cold (either due to an outage or new construction), it is often necessary to “kick-start” the process with an external heat source. Furnace heatup is a service to bring these industrial furnaces from ambient temperature up to a sustainable operating condition.\nFurnace Hold Hot – When an industrial furnace interrupts the generation of the process heat but it isn’t desirable to allow the process to cool down, a furnace hold hot service is often used. Emergency hold hot service is sometimes used due to utility interruptions or natural disasters. Planned hold hot services may be used when a portion of the process needs to undergo repairs and it is undesirable to cool down the entire process.\nFurnace Outage – Many large industrial furnaces operate 24 hours per day and 7 days per week. The processes are continuous and are rarely interrupted. On occasion, a furnace outage is scheduled in order to conduct maintenance and repairs that can only occur during a process stop. In some industries, the outages are referred to as a turnaround.\nGunned Refractories – Refractory material may be installed via a method known as gunning. Refractory material is transported in a compressed air stream and is projected onto the refractory surface. The material may have water added at the nozzle or may be pre-moistened. The objective is to have the material stick to the target surface and to avoid rebound.\nHeat Recovery Steam Generator (HRSG) – This is a type of boiler that captures excess process heat. They may be installed before the exhaust stack on an industrial furnace or they can be used in conjunction with a combined cycle power generator. A combined cycle turbine has one stage driven by the products of combustion and a second stage driven by steam from the HRSG that captures some of the heat left over after the first stage.\nHydrocarbon Processing Industries (HPI) – This industry category refers to oil refining, gas processing, LNG, and petrochemical industries.\nMeltouts – On occasion, liquid materials solidify in the wrong place and need to be removed. One method of removing these materials is to melt them back into a liquid and allow the liquid to flow to the desired location.\nModulus of Rupture (MOR) – A quality measure of a refractory that measures its strength in resisting flexural (bending) forces.\nMonolithic Refractory – A refractory that is applied on-site in the unfired state and forms a continuous mass. Examples of monolithic refractory include castable, shotcrete, gunning mixes, plastic and ramming materials. Once placed, a refractory dryout is required to create the refractory properties.\nPermeability – The ability of a gas to pass thru a refractory structure. Permeability is enhanced when porosity interconnects and provides a gas path. Porosity does not necessarily create permeability. During refractory dryout, steam uses permeability to escape from the refractory structure.\nPorosity – Voids in the refractory structure create porosity. Porosity can occur as large individual voids or as micro voids dispersed throughout the structure.\nPlastic Refractory – A refractory mixture utilizing bonding agents such as clays, phosphates or resins. The material is typically delivered for installation as wet blocks. During installation, plastics do not require as much compaction/deformation as ramming material. The blocks are typically tamped together to form a continuous lining. Once placed, a dryout is required to create the refractory properties.\nPost Weld Heat Treating (PWHT) – When metal structures are welded, the heat affected zone has modified metallurgical properties compared to the parent metal. In order to restore metallurgical properties, a thermal cycle is often required. Most post weld heat treating is conducted locally on the weld with electrical resistance heating. In some cases, it is beneficial to heat an entire tank or weldament and, in these cases, combustion post weld heat treating is often deployed.\nRamming Refractory – A refractory mixture utilizing bonding agents such as clay, organics, phosphates, silica or tar. The material may be delivered for installation either in wet or dry form. The material is typically compacted with a pneumatic hammer or other compacting tool. Shear created during ramming contributes to the materials density and final properties. Once placed, a dryout is required to create the refractory properties.\nRatio Burner – Ratio burners attempt to maintain an optimal mixture of air and fuel. This ratio is usually slightly greater than the stoichiometric ratio in order to ensure complete combustion of all fuel. This type of burner is typically selected for process burner applications since it has good energy efficiency, environmental advantages, and is well suited to maintaining high temperature processes.\nRecycled Hot Water Glass Furnace Drain (RHWD) – This service is similar to the cold water glass furnace drain except that the water is collected after separation from the cullet and it is recycled back to be used again in a continuous closed loop.\nRefractory Cure – This is the initial period after placement of a castable refractory before the start of the dryout. During this period, reactions are occurring that result in the hard set of the refractory. Typically the refractory manufacturer specifies the duration of the cure period and it may be a function of the ambient temperature.\nRefractory Dryout – For monolithic refractory, following installation and the cure period, heat is applied per the manufacturer’s schedule in order to drive off both free and chemically combined water. This thermal treatment is the last step in achieving the desired properties in the installed refractory. This process is sometimes referred to as bake-out, heat cure, dry out, dry-out, or preheat.\nRefractory Spall – A mechanical failure of a refractory lining resulting in cracks, fractures, delamination, crumbling and/or explosive failure. Refractory spalling can occur due to many different root causes but, if it occurs, it typically happens during the refractory dryout. During dryout the refractory lining is exposed to high forces as water is converted to steam and it tries to escape the lining. If the refractory properties have been compromised due to any prior activities, then failure is likely to occur during the dryout. Refractory spalling typically occurs because the material does not have the strength to withstand the forces caused by the evolving steam during dryout. The two main issues are the material properties and the rate of steam generation. This condition is also referred to as explosive spalling or refractory blowout. Quality control procedures and adherence to the manufacturer’s mixing, placing, curing and drying instructions are the best preventative measures to avoid this condition.\nRegenerator Decongestion – This is another term for the sulfate burnout process.\nShotcrete – A refractory material that is mixed (like a castable) and then applied by pumping the mixture to a nozzle where it is mixed with air and an activator to begin the curing. The mixture is pneumatically “shot” on to the installation surface. Once placed, a dryout is required to create the refractory properties.\nSulfate Burnouts (SBO) – In glass furnaces with regenerators, sulfates tend to condense in the checker-pack over time. The accumulation of sulfates restricts air passage and eventually furnace operation is impacted. One method of removing sulfates from the checkers involves installing a burner in the bottom of the regenerator and heating the checker pack to above the melting point of the sulfates. This allows the sulfates to run out of the checkers to the bottom of the regenerator and air flow is restored to the furnace. This process is also referred to as regenerator decongestion or checker burnouts.\nTurnaround – In oil refineries and other process industries, periodic maintenance outages are planned where the process is completely stopped. Extensive planning and preparation is done to optimize the work accomplished and to minimize the downtime. These outages are frequently called turnarounds."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f95b1d36-eaf2-4132-b1de-1c017fc80ff0>","<urn:uuid:7ff9bbbf-b2b9-4989-adeb-86b526508f61>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the defensive restrictions in 'The Finish Drill' compare to the defensive techniques mentioned in crossover dribble defense?","answer":"In The Finish Drill, defensive players are strictly limited to fouling with their chest only and cannot initiate contact on box outs until after the shooter lands. This creates a very specific type of defensive pressure focused on body positioning and chest contact. In contrast, when defending against crossover dribbles, the defensive approach is more comprehensive, as teams commonly know how to defend against standard crossover moves, requiring offensive players to develop unpredictable variations like between-the-legs or behind-the-back dribbles to successfully evade defenders. The defensive strategies against crossover dribbles are more focused on anticipating and stealing the ball during the hand transition, especially when offensive players dribble too high.","context":["I’ve had the opportunity to work with and observe a bunch of great basketball coaches over the years, and it’s always fun to learn new drills and new ways to teach and run old drills as well. Today, I wanted to share 5 unusual drills that I’ve personally only seen a very small number of coaches use but that seem to be highly effective at helping players to improve.\nIn 1994, my family moved to San Antonio, and I had a chance to play for Charlie Boggess, a legendary coach and a great mentor and friend. He borrowed and tweaked and developed a lot of great drills, and 16 3-2-1 was probably my favorite.\nIn this drill, all players are spread out on the different baskets shooting a 1 and 1. If the player misses the first free throw, he must run 3 down and back sprints. If he misses the second free throw, then he must run 2 down and back sprints. And if he makes both free throws, he only has to run 1 down and back sprint. The goal is to make 16 free throws in less than 8 minutes, and players must do 10 pushups for each free throw they fall short of 16.\nThis drill is great because the kids are shooting free throws under pressure while winded, which is of course quite similar to an actual game. Not coincidentally, Coach Boggess’s teams led the state of Texas in FT% a bunch of times, and his teams regularly shot 75%+ as a team, which is an incredible feat for a high school team.\nIn the early 2000’s, I had a chance to watch a Yugoslavian coach run a practice in The Netherlands, and 2 things stuck out. One, he chain smoked cigarettes in the gym throughout the duration of practice. And two, he ran a very unique transition drill that I haven’t seen before or since.\nMany coaches in the US run the transition drill where 4 players line up on the baseline facing 4 opposing players lined up at the free throw line extended. When the coach throws the ball to 1 of the 4 baseline players, they attack in transition and the defensive player aligned across from the offensive player who receives the pass must touch the baseline before sprinting to try to get in the play. I really like this drill, although it’s not at all uncommon.\n“Yugoslavia” is a similar drill, but includes a few tweaks that make the drill even more challenging and beneficial. First, it’s a 3 on 3 drill, not a 4 on 4 drill Second, the defensive players are lined up at the top of the key extended, not the 3 point line extended. Third, the offensive players are not allowed to dribble. Fourth, the offensive team has only 7 seconds to get a shot on the other end. And finally, the defensive team attacks back in transition with dribbling allowed and 10 seconds to get a shot.\nThis drill works on footwork, making quick decisions, seeing more than pass ahead, transition offense and defense, communication, passing, late clock situations, rebounding, and really every other aspect of basketball. Plus, it’s a drill the kids really enjoy once they get the hang of it.\nMy 8th grade coach was a gentleman named Garin Brockman (Rest in Peace, Coach). Coach Brockman was the first coach to teach me the importance of practicing finishing through contact, and he devised a variety of drills to teach and develop this essential skill. “Brockman” combines a variety of Coach Brockman’s drills into 1 drill that works on finishing, footwork, helpside defense, and rebounding.\nBrockman starts with a player between the elbow and the 3 point line facing the baseline, a player on the opposite block facing toward half court, and a player with a ball on the baseline facing the player a step beyond the elbow. The other players are in line behind the player with the ball (with more than about 5 players, it’s best to do this drill on multiple baskets).\nThe player with the ball on the baseline passes to the player outside the elbow, who meets the pass to land at the elbow. The player on the opposite block is chopping his feet in a good defensive stance and is starting his defensive “chatter.” After passing the ball, the baseline player chases his own pass and takes a dribble hand off, at which point the elbow player crowds his space as a “dummy defender.” The player who now has the ball again (the same player who originally had the ball on the baseline) executes a straight line drive (body to body) to the rim. The second the first dribble hits the floor, the defensive player on the opposite block is now live in the play trying to stop the driver from scoring. The rep isn’t over until the offensive player scores or the defensive player gets the rebound. Offense goes to defense, defense goes to elbow, elbow goes to the end of the line on the baseline.\nHere’s the progression:\nStarting with the left elbow (the left elbow in this case means the left of the player on the baseline who is facing toward half court), the player first chases his pass to take the handoff going to the inside of the player at the elbow and uses his left pivot foot to take the handoff and execute a front pivot to get square to the rim, then attacks the rim with a right foot direct drive step and a right handed dribble drive. Next is a left foot front pivot followed by a right foot crossover drive step and a left handed dribble drive. Next is a left foot reverse pivot followed by a right foot direct drive step and a right handed dribble drive. And last is a left foot reverse pivot followed by a right foot crossover drive step and a left handed dribble drive.\nNow, instead of going on the inside of the player at the left elbow, players will go to the outside and use their right pivot foot. The progression is exactly the same, except that the pivot foot and drive foot are reversed. First, right foot front pivot, left foot direct drive step, left hand dribble drive. Next, right foot front pivot, left foot crossover step, right handed dribble drive. Next, right foot reverse pivot, left foot direct drive step, left handed dribble drive. And finally, right foot reverse pivot, left foot crossover drive step, right handed dribble drive.\nOnce the players have finished the progression from the left elbow, everyone changes sides to work on it from the right elbow, with the same progressions.\nBrockman works on the 8 most essential pieces of stationary offensive basketball footwork (left front pivot, left reverse pivot, right front pivot, right reverse pivot, right foot direct drive step, right foot crossover drive step, left foot direct drive step, left foot crossover drive step). However, it also teaches the importance of driving in as straight a line as possible (go THROUGH the defender, not around him- shoulder through the ribs- body to body). Plus, it works on helpside defense, defensive communication, reading the helpside defense, finishing through the helpside defense, passing, meeting the pass, and rebounding. In short, Brockman is one of my favorite basketball developmental drills, because it incorporates so many critical aspects of the game.\n“The Finish Drill”\nLike Brockman, The Finish Drill works on finishing through live contact, as well as several other key areas of the game. When I worked with Coach JD Mayo at Dallas Skyline High School in 02-03, we did this drill almost every day, and you could really see the difference it made over the course of the season.\nThe finish drill starts with an offensive player in the paint with the defensive player “chested up.” The offensive player is trying to score but isn’t allowed to dribble. The defensive player is of course trying to prevent the score, but is only allowed to foul with his chest (no hacking allowed). Once the shot goes up, the drill is live, and The Finish Drill is a continuous game of 1 on 1.\nHere are the basic ground rules:\n1. As long as the ball stays inside the “mini-lane” (lane line to lane line, baseline to the bottom of the dotted circle), there is no dribbling allowed at all.\n2. If the ball goes outside the mini-lane but in bounds and inside the 3 point line, the offensive player is allowed 1 dribble.\n3. If the ball goes outside the 3 point line or out of bounds on the baseline, the offensive player is allowed 2 dribbles.\n4. This is not a jump shooting drill- all shots must be layups or dunks.\n5. The defensive player is only allowed to foul with his chest, and is not allowed to initiate contact on a box out until after the shooter lands.\n6. The offensive player is only allowed to foul with his shoulder and body- no push offs, free arms, etc.\n7. The Finish Drill is not make it take it, nor is it about taking turns. The ball is always live, make or miss, and both players have the opportunity to gather the rebound/loose ball and try to score.\n8. The Finish Drill can be run to a certain score (first to 5, first to 7, etc) or on the clock (at Skyline, we did sets of 1 minute where the kids kept score).\nThe finish drill was hugely beneficial to us in terms of finishing, defending in the paint, and rebounding, but it is also an incredible drill in terms of toughness and basketball-specific strength and conditioning.\n“The Channel Drill”\nThe Channel Drill was a normal part of our guard workouts when I worked at Georgia Tech under Coach Hewitt (assistant coach Charlton “CY” Young used to tell some hilarious stories about the battles Moochie Norris and Marquis Daniels had in the Channel Drill during CY’s time at Auburn).\nHere are the rules:\n1. Set up cones (or any other object you have handy- could be sticks, rocks, coins, anything) to extend the lane lines all the way out to half court. The lane lines extended are the boundaries of the Channel Drill.\n2. The offensive player starts with the ball at half court facing the rim with the dribble unused and the defensive player hacking and bodying the offensive player to death- the offensive player must withstand the fouling and the contact by pivoting and staying low with his eyes on the game for 3-5 seconds before the drill becomes live- if the offensive player fumbles or loses the ball or travels, it’s a turnover and the offensive player loses his turn.\n3. After the 3-5 seconds, the coach says “go” or “live” and then the offensive player is attacking in the “channel” versus the live defender trying to score.\n4. The offensive player can use unlimited dribbles, but he can not “back the defender down” and he must stay in bounds.\n5. If the offensive player scores, he goes on offense again.\n6. Each rep doesn’t end until the offensive player scores or the defensive players gets a stop AND a rebound.\nThe Channel Drill is a very simple drill, but it helps develop ball handling, footwork, defense, finishing, conditioning, toughness, balance, ball security, attacking downhill in as straight a line as possible- in other words, it less of a drill to work on 1 or 2 skills and more of a drill to work on basketball.\nThanks very much for reading. Hopefully, you’ll find at least 1 of these drills to be helpful. This is the first time I have tried to explain basketball drills strictly through the written word with no diagrams, and I am not sure these drills will be clear. If you need clarifications, please email firstname.lastname@example.org. Anyway, thanks again for reading, and thanks to Coach Rav for providing this awesome platform to share.","Effective dribbling is one of the most important aspects in the game of basketball, and people who can use both their hands for the purpose of dribbling undoubtedly make better players. When a team is playing offense in a game and is moving down the court towards the opponents basket, the aim is to dribble the ball in a manner that leaves the defending team confused. The individual who is dribbling needs to move fast, needs to keep his eyes up so that he can spot the runs that this teammates are making and most importantly, he needs to constantly change the direction of the ball so that the person marking him does not get an opportunity to steal the basketball away from him.\nThe most effective way to achieve the last portion is to use both hands while dribbling, and this is a skill that needs to be worked on and trained for intensely. Not everyone is ambidextrous and not everyone can dribble effectively with both hands, so this is a skill that is inculcated in people who are capable of doing this. A crossover dribble is nothing but a form of dribbling where the dribbler is constantly using both hands to bounce the ball, thus giving him an opportunity to dribble past his marker more effectively.\nSomeone who only dribbles with a single hand becomes very predictable in his actions, and this makes it easier for the individual marking him to steal the ball away from him. Changes in speed and direction of the body of the dribbler become twice as effective if he can shift the ball between both hands and then glide past the opponent to gain space on the court to either pick out a pass or to shoot.\nBest Crossover Drills in Basketball\nFirst and foremost, some basic conditioning is required in order to perform crossover dribbles effectively. This involves strengthening the legs and the lower body, improving the speed and the agility, improving hand-eye coordination and of course, building the stamina. All these elements are strengthened with the help of many different drills and exercises, and once this has been done, the individual can start focusing on drills for basketball crossover dribbles.\nA basketball player needs to learn how to dribble using both hands, and this can only be acquired through hours of practice. The simplest drill requires nothing but a basketball. The player should simply practice dribbling the ball with both hands and should move around the court while doing so. This will get his body adjusted to the process, and it will also make him mentally prepared for the kind of movements that he will have to perform.\nOnce the basic dribble has been understood by the player, a coach will need to place some cones on the court in a straight line. The distance between each cone should be around 3 feet, and the player has to move fast and go between the cones in a zig-zag pattern. He should be bouncing the basketball while doing this and every time he turns to the left he should be transferring the ball from his right hand to his left hand, and the other way round when he turns right.\nOne common problem that players face while performing crossovers is that they tend to dribble the ball too high when they are shifting hands. This gives the opponent a moment to steal the ball. In order to avoid doing this the player must stand next to a regular sized table and bounce the ball between both hands, while constantly keeping it under the table. Shorter bounces are preferable for such dribbles, and these table drills will help achieve this.\nSince crossover dribbles are quite common, most teams know how to defend against it. Hence, in order to dribble successfully one needs to mix up the routine and do something unpredictable as well. Certain crossover dribbles shift the ball from one hand to another after it has passed under the leg of the dribbler, and another move causes the ball to shift hands by moving it behind the back of the dribbler. These are moves that need time and patience to master, but they can be highly effective for dodging an opposing mark if they are performed correctly.\nAnother great way to learn some moves is to watch some videos and highlights of some of the best basketball players in the world. The kind of moves that feature on these videos will simply blow your mind away, and they will then inspire you to perform these moves yourself. Performing crossover drills will improve the efficiency of these dribbles, but ironically, the creativity and originality of dribbling can only be achieved by watching other people perform some great dribbles."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7cffd727-865a-47dd-a9bf-38e8a83893c2>","<urn:uuid:0d9c5297-64ff-4b6d-8ff0-14a2115f7220>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the musical characteristics of Saint-Saëns's First Violin Concerto, and how does this contrast with his personal temperament as a composer?","answer":"Saint-Saëns's First Violin Concerto, composed in 1859, is characterized by thematic charm and concise design, similar to his First Cello Concerto. It is a single short movement with three distinct sections, beginning with six emphatic chords and featuring a delightful central section with notable woodwind writing. This elegant and concise composition contrasts with Saint-Saëns's complex personal character - while he was an extraordinary musical prodigy who could memorize all of Beethoven's piano sonatas by age 12, he was also known to be difficult to get along with, developing a streak of reactionary bitterness in his later years and feuding with several contemporaries, including falling out with César Franck and opposing Debussy's work.","context":["SAINT-SAËNS Violin Concertos Nos 1-3\nHyperion could hardly have launched its Romantic Violin Concerto series with a happier programme. Like Beethoven’s and Chopin’s First and Second Piano Concertos, the first two violin concertos of Saint-Saens were composed in reverse order. The Second is the longer and lesser-known of the two (though Ivry Gitlis made a stunning record of it for Philips in the late 1960s), but the First Concerto more resembles the thematic charm and concise design of the First Cello Concerto. Cast in a single short movement that falls into three distinct sections, it launches the soloist on his way right from the start (six emphatic chords) and features a delightful central section with some felicitous woodwind writing. Hyperion holds a trump card in Philippe Graffin, whose elegant, emotionally charged playing is strongly reminiscent of the young Menuhin (he has a similar sort of sound) and whose understanding of the idiom seems to me second to none – certainly among modern players.\nSaint-Saens’s First Violin Concerto was composed in 1859, whereas his Second preceded it by a year. Unexpectedly, the first movement’s thematic material has an almost Weberian slant. The orchestration is heavier than in the First (trombones in the second movement are reminiscent of Berlioz), and the musical arguments are both more formal and more forcefully stated. It is a more overtly virtuoso work than the First Concerto, and to my mind rather less memorable, but again Graffin weaves a winsome solo line and Martyn Brabbins directs a strong account of the orchestral score, with prominently projected woodwinds.\nThe relatively well-known Third Concerto (1880) is roughly the same length as the Second (around half-an-hour), but is more consistently interesting. The basic material is of higher quality, the key relations more telling and orchestration infinitely more delicate. I can honestly say that I have never heard a recording that liberates so much of the score’s instrumental detail, probably because most of Graffin’s predecessors have invariably been balanced way in front of the orchestra. The closing moments of the slow movement, where violin harmonics are doubled by a clarinet, are pure magic.\nAs to comparisons, a handful of good Firsts are currently available, though none ‘speaks’ quite so beguilingly as Graffin does here. I would personally court alternatives only in the Third: Milstein’s aristocratic reading with the Philharmonia is in a class of its own, and so is Aaron Rosand’s full-blooded version for Vox. Neither is currently listed but Graffin compares favourably with both (his is a gentler, more introverted view of the score) and is of course far better recorded. This is the only domestically released CD that includes all three concertos on a single disc.\nIncidentally, there is also an ‘uncompleted’ Fourth Concerto (1880) known as Morceau de concert which Gitlis coupled with his version of the Second Concerto (it’s out on the Continent on Philips (CD) 446 188-2, just in case you fancy browsing the internet) and which Hyperion might profitably programme alongside other shorter Saint-Saens works for violin and orchestra.\nAltogether an excellent production and an auspicious start to a series which, like its piano predecessor, seems set to bring a wealth of musical delights to our attention. DD provides excellent annotation and I can hardly wait for the next instalment.'","Camille Saint-Saëns was an extraordinary person. One of the great child prodigies of his time, he first performed in public at the age of five, playing the piano part in a Beethoven piano and violin sonata; by age 12, he is said to have memorized all 32 of Beethoven’s piano sonatas. His musical facility was equal in later life, when he worked as a piano virtuoso and organist; Saint-Saëns was also known to be an astonishing sight-reader and improviser. Wagner was amazed to watch him read his own opera scores at the piano, and his organ transcription of Liszt’s St. Francois d’Assise predicant aux oiseaux so thrilled the composer that he said it was the greatest musical feat he’d ever heard. Saint-Saëns was also the successful author of plays and poems, and a devout student of philosophy and science. Berlioz, ever handy with a bon mot, remarked that Saint-Saëns ‘knows everything, but lacks inexperience.’\nHe was also, it seems, a hard man to get along with. He remained friends with Liszt, Berlioz, and his student Gabriel Fauré throughout his life, but many of Saint-Saëns’ collegial relationships soured. Early on, he had been a champion of Schumann, Wagner, and other revolutionary-style artists, but he turned harshly against them as Germanophilia took more strident forms. He also fell out with César Franck, and feuded openly with Vincent D’Indy (as a prominent musician and aristocrat, D’Indy played on the anti-Dreyfus side of the Dreyfus affair – he may not have been so easy to get along with, either). Profound family misfortune and assorted professional issues seem to have painted a streak of reactionary bitterness in the later years of Saint-Saëns’ life. He couldn’t stand Debussy, and was one of the first to leave the premiere of Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring. (He reportedly left after the opening bassoon solo, which can’t have been more than about ten seconds. It is hard to imagine anyone leaving any sooner, at least not for musical reasons.)\nOver the years, his reputation has been more of one who wrote music to charm rather than music to explore. This probably has something to do with general dissonance between French and German musical thought, and also has something to do with his unwillingness to explore or accept new styles. But these complaints might also be somewhat recreational, and they can seem shrill in the face of what he wrote. To reject the style he chose seems to reject the possibility that he found access to the content he wanted within that style. And he wrote great music. Although one may hear his music in a pops context (concertos, Carnival of the Animals, and organ symphony, especially), his music is full of layers and questions; furthermore, his skill in technical matters of composing – especially in writing idiomatically and virtuosically for instruments – was tremendous. However more conventional its instrumentation and however more unusual it may be to hear than Carnival of the Animals or Havanaise, the Cello Sonata No. 1 is just as replete with compositional brilliance as could be expected of the brilliant and bristly man."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:dcee0892-d285-4817-95a2-926bad1660e4>","<urn:uuid:a5b5648b-16a3-43ee-83cb-b0e494729efa>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As someone studying planetary science and agriculture: How did Earth's early core formation affect carbon distribution, and what benefits does vertical farming offer for resource conservation compared to traditional farming?","answer":"Earth's core formation initially posed a challenge for carbon distribution since iron-rich alloys in the core have a strong affinity for carbon, which would have trapped most carbon in the core. However, experiments showed that carbon could be excluded from the core and remain in the silicate mantle if the iron alloys were rich in silicon or sulfur. As for vertical farming, it offers significant resource conservation benefits compared to traditional farming: it uses 90% less water through reuse of water flow in vertical systems, requires considerably less space by expanding production vertically instead of horizontally, and allows for precise control of resources in an enclosed environment. This is particularly important given that conventional agriculture currently uses about 1.5 billion hectares of the world's surface area and requires large quantities of water, fertilizer, and pesticides.","context":["In a new study published in Nature Geoscience, DCO scientist Rajdeep Dasgupta (Rice University, USA) and colleagues offer a new answer to a long-debated geological question: How did carbon-based life develop on Earth, given that most of the planet’s carbon should have either boiled away in the planet’s earliest days or become locked in Earth’s core ?\n“The challenge is to explain the origin of the volatile elements like carbon that remain outside the core in the mantle portion of our planet,” said Dasgupta.\nDasgupta’s lab specializes in recreating the high-pressure and high-temperature conditions that exist deep inside Earth and other rocky planets. His team squeezes rocks in hydraulic presses that can simulate conditions about 250 miles below Earth’s surface or at the core-mantle boundary of smaller planets like Mercury.\n“Even before this paper, we had published several studies that showed that even if carbon did not vaporize into space when the planet was largely molten, it would end up in the metallic core of our planet, because the iron-rich alloys there have a strong affinity for carbon,” Dasgupta said.\nEarth’s core, which is mostly iron, makes up about one-third of the planet’s mass. Earth’s silicate mantle accounts for the other two-thirds and extends more than 1,500 miles below Earth’s surface. Earth’s crust and atmosphere are so thin that they account for less than 1 percent of the planet’s mass. The mantle, atmosphere and crust constantly exchange elements, including the volatile elements needed for life.\nIf Earth’s initial allotment of carbon boiled away into space or got stuck in the core, where did the carbon in the mantle and biosphere come from?\n“One popular idea has been that volatile elements like carbon, sulfur, nitrogen and hydrogen were added after Earth’s core finished forming,” said first author Yuan Li (Guangzhou Institute of Geochemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences). “Any of those elements that fell to Earth in meteorites and comets more than about 100 million years after the solar system formed could have avoided the intense heat of the magma ocean that covered Earth up to that point.\n“The problem with that idea is that while it can account for the abundance of many of these elements, there are no known meteorites that would produce the ratio of volatile elements in the silicate portion of our planet,” Li said.\nA schematic depiction of proto Earth’s merger with a potentially Mercury-like planetary embryo, a scenario supported by new high pressure-temperature experiments at Rice University. Magma ocean processes could lead planetary embryos to develop silicon- or sulfur-rich metallic cores and carbon-rich outer layers. If Earth merged with such a planet early in its history, it could explain how Earth acquired its carbon and sulfur. Credit: Rajdeep Dasgupta\nIn late 2013, Dasgupta’s team began thinking about unconventional ways to address the issue of volatiles and core composition, and they decided to conduct experiments to gauge how sulfur or silicon might alter the affinity of iron for carbon. The idea didn’t come from Earth studies, but from some of Earth’s planetary neighbors.\n“We thought we definitely needed to break away from the conventional core composition of just iron and nickel and carbon,” Dasgupta recalled. “So we began exploring very sulfur-rich and silicon-rich alloys, in part because the core of Mars is thought to be sulfur-rich and the core of Mercury is thought to be relatively silicon-rich.\n“It was a compositional spectrum that seemed relevant, if not for our own planet, then definitely in the scheme of all the terrestrial planetary bodies that we have in our solar system,” he said.\nThe experiments revealed that carbon could be excluded from the core — and relegated to the silicate mantle — if the iron alloys in the core were rich in either silicon or sulfur.\n“The key data revealed how the partitioning of carbon between the metallic and silicate portions of terrestrial planets varies as a function of the variables like temperature, pressure and sulfur or silicon content,” Li said.\nThe team mapped out the relative concentrations of carbon that would arise under various levels of sulfur and silicon enrichment, and the researchers compared those concentrations to the known volatiles in Earth’s silicate mantle.\n“One scenario that explains the carbon-to-sulfur ratio and carbon abundance is that an embryonic planet like Mercury, which had already formed a silicon-rich core, collided with and was absorbed by Earth,” Dasgupta said. “Because it’s a massive body, the dynamics could work in a way that the core of that planet would go directly to the core of our planet, and the carbon-rich mantle would mix with Earth’s mantle.\n“In this paper, we focused on carbon and sulfur,” he said. “Much more work will need to be done to reconcile all of the volatile elements, but at least in terms of the carbon-sulfur abundances and the carbon-sulfur ratio, we find this scenario could explain Earth’s present carbon and sulfur budgets.”\nThe research was supported by NASA and the National Science Foundation.\nArticle adapted from source.","Agricultural systems around the world need to adapt to the rapidly changing environmental, demographic, and socioeconomic landscapes, and new alternative practices, such as vertical agriculture, may offer new opportunities to accelerate such adaptation.\nNext Gen Farming Without Soil and 90% Less Water | GRATEFUL\nWhat is vertical farming and why is it important\nModern agricultural systems encompass an estimated 1.5 billion hectares of the world’s surface area. With a growing population and resource needs, the availability of arable land is shrinking rapidly.\nSince the agricultural revolution, conventional agriculture has focused on practices requiring considerable quantities of space, water, fertilizer, and pesticides. The past 50 years have seen an accelerating rate of increase in these requirements as modern food production aims to increase productivity in the hopes of addressing growing food insecurity.\nLooking into the future, yield production is forecasted to decrease due to widespread environmental and socioeconomic changes that will generate unpredictable consequences on food systems.\nIn response, many strategies have been developed as alternatives to conventional agricultural practices. These strategies have focused on key principles and their combination to be effective: require less space, less water, and increase yield per unit of area. Moreover, due to the negative effects of agrichemicals, modern practices have also aimed to use significantly less to avoid potentially adverse effects for humans and animals.\nOne such alternative is the development of vertical agriculture, also referred to as vertical farming. As the name implies, vertical agriculture relies on expanding production vertically and not horizontally. Vertical agriculture is a multilayer indoor plant production system that allows for precise control of growth factors, such as light, temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide concentration, water, and nutrients.\nThis allows for the growing and production of crops year-round, completely independent of solar light and other external conditions. Indeed, vertical agriculture makes use of key concepts within ecology and physiology to optimize growing and fertilization within controlled conditions. For instance, elements of photobiology, thermomorphogenesis, hydroponics, and genetic breeding, are all used commonly across systems of vertical agriculture.\nBenefits, challenges, and disadvantages moving from horizontal to vertical farming\nAs a result of tight control over crop breeding, growing, and harvesting, vertical farming provides several benefits relative to conventional methods of ‘horizontal’ food production. This was the topic of a literature review by Kalantari et al. published in 2016 in the Journal of Landscape Ecology.\nFrom a systems perspective, the enclosed design prevents pests and diseases from entering by the adoption of a high level of hygiene, continuous monitoring, and non-chemical disinfection, providing security from crops. Moreover, recent technology has also allowed for automated control over environmental conditions by using sensors and imaging techniques in combination with crop simulation models and artificial intelligence, limiting the need for physical labor.\nVertical farming also allows for flexible organization, with designs ranging from large vertical walls covered with crops to large hangars or re-used shipping containers that can be transported. Consequently, vertical agricultural systems, can comprise many varying sizes and be located within many different areas from the middle of highly urbanized cities to more suburban or rural areas.\nMoreover, the verticality element of this system also provides nutrient and water flow, helping to reuse costly resources. The reduction in space also means there is a significant increase in yield per area, holding extensive potential for a future world of urbanization.\nFrom an economic perspective, vertical farming also provides for more jobs in localized areas and is community-focused by addressing the needs of immediate areas, which in turn can provide food at a lower price. Finally, the optionality of location for vertical systems also allows producers to reduce transport costs, as consumers may access them within urban areas, or transport can be minimized to nearby areas.\nHowever, despite the design, environmental, and economic advantages, vertical farming also incorporates several issues that remain a challenge to its broader implementation as a system.\nVertical farming has a high energy requirement and needs extensive investment costs to implement and develop successfully. Moreover, indoor issues relating to excessive UV, heat, and ozone-induced plant damage may have unpredictable repercussions for plant growth.\nAdditionally, vertical systems are difficult to adapt to a larger scale. They are costly to build and maintain and have yet to demonstrate the ability to provide food for larger areas than community-scale populations. This would make it difficult to implement in areas at higher risk of food insecurity, such as developing agricultural nations.\nThe lack of empirical research on a broader scale has meant that vertical farming has yet to develop past the concept stage on community levels, as persistent issues make it difficult to break through to a larger scale.\nImage Credit: YEINISM/Shutterstock.com\nGrowing skywards - the implications of vertical farming in a rapidly populating and changing world\nAmong the development of alternative agricultural practices, vertical agriculture provides a promising solution for many of the challenges facing current agricultural policies. However, for vertical systems to be integrated on a larger scale requires further technological progress and economic investment.\nNevertheless, gradually implementing more verticality, or combining it with other practices aiming for more sustainable practices may be promising. For instance, the combination of verticality with other practices such as intercropping may be particularly beneficial for developing more sustainable food systems.\nIncorporating technological progress into vertical systems also holds promise, with automated sensors and machinery able to operate near-independently. Progress in gene editing and plant genome modifications will also allow for faster, bigger, and healthier crops, allowing vertical agriculture to produce more over time.\nThroughout agricultural history, farming systems have typically spread over large spans of land, yet the reduction in arable land, as well as the increase in demand to house growing populations, means that such strategies need to be reconsidered, and vertical agriculture may play a role looking into the future.\nContinue Reading: Benefits of Vertical Agriculture and Hydroponics\n- Beacham, A.

{"question":"What are the differences between current biosignature search strategies and recommended future approaches?","answer":"Current strategies focus narrowly on searching for Earth-like planets orbiting sun-like stars, specifically looking for combined oxygen-methane signatures as evidence of life. However, research suggests this approach needs to change. Future searches should be broadened beyond just Earth-like planets around sun-like stars, as the chances of eliminating false positive biosignatures actually increase when looking at dimmer stars or larger planets. Additionally, while current methods face fundamental limitations in distinguishing between planetary and lunar atmospheres due to photo noise, future approaches will require studying entire atmospheric compositions to avoid jumping to conclusions about biological potential, since many gases can be produced by both biological and geological processes.","context":["Given that we are unlikely to be visiting an exoplanet any time soon, astronomers have been contemplating whether it might be possible to detect indications of simple life – a biosignature – from a distance. Many think that the strongest case for extraterrestrial life would be the discovery of oxygen and methane on the same body. They also think that the likelihood of finding such a biosignature is greatest on an Earth-like planet that is orbiting a sun-like star.\nAstronomers who hope to search for these biosignatures in expolanets, however, may be in for a disappointment. New research finds that there is no way we can confirm that such a signature is actually the result of extraterrestrial life. The problem, it turns out, is that an exomoon’s atmosphere will be indistinguishable from the one of the planet it orbits.\nSearching for extraterrestrial life is no easy feat. Astronomers have to first search for a star that has planets. Then they have to ensure that there is at least one planet that orbits this star in the habitable zone, which is a region around the star in which we might expect liquid water. Finally, they have to record the faint light that originated from the bright star and was reflected off the exoplanet after having passed through its atmosphere.\nThis faint light, even if only a handful of photons, when compared with light from the parent star is enough to give some indication of the chemicals in the atmosphere of this planet. Life as we know it creates two gases that wouldn’t naturally be present in an atmosphere at the same time – oxygen from photosynthesis and methane from microbes.\nBoth oxygen and methane can be created independently by non-living processes, so their individual presence is of little interest. What scientists are looking for is both of them in the atmosphere of a single body. If these reactive gases are not constantly replenished by living things, they will react with each other, creating carbon dioxide and water. As a result, we should not observe them in the same atmosphere without a large, living source.\nIn the new study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Hanno Rein at the University of Toronto and his colleagues wanted to know whether anything else could mimic this biosignature. While working through potential false positives, which are signals that would show signs of life but in reality there isn’t life, he found a big one: exomoons. Rein found that observers on Earth will not be able to tell whether the signs of methane and oxygen originate from a single celestial body, or come from two nearby worlds.\nThis could happen because, just as Earth has a moon, there is a chance that exoplanets will have exomoons. While we have yet to find an exomoon, looking at the various moons of our solar system’s planets suggests that exomoons ought to be plentiful. However, even if they are plentiful, chances are that exomoons will be difficult to spot.\nIf both these celestial bodies have an atmosphere and in their atmospheres the exoplanet has oxygen and the exomoon has methane (or vice-versa), then an observer on Earth will record an oxygen-methane biosignature. This might seems like evidence for life, whereas in reality both these gases are being produced by non-living processes on two separate celestial bodies. Since they can’t react with each other, they will be able to build up to high levels.\n“Even if we somehow developed ways of finding exomoons, we won’t be able to tease out the difference between their atmospheres given the limited amount of light that reaches us,” Rein said. This fundamental limit on the light that reaches us is called photo noise.\nRein limited his analysis to biosignatures coming from Earth-like planets orbiting a sun-like star, which is the combination that astronomers are betting has the greatest chance of hosting life. The American space agency NASA recently announced that they had found such an Earth-sized planet less than 500 light years away, although the star it orbits isn’t sun-like.\nWhile their analysis might seem quite restrictive and involves a number of assumptions, it does not really matter: interpretation of biosignatures needs to be flawless. According to David Cullen at the University of Cranfield, “This study seems to highlight a real issue that will needed to be considered when interpreting biosignatures.”\nRein himself was surprised to find such a limitation. However, he sees the results of his work in positive light. “Finding such a limitation tells us what we should focus on in the future. Rather than a restricted search for Earth-like planets orbiting sun-like stars, we should broaden our search,” he said.\nWhat this research shows is a need to move away from a highly focused search for extraterrestrial life that is currently in place. Rein points out that the chances of eliminating such false positive biosignatures increases as the star becomes dimmer or larger planets are considered. Perhaps alien life is not just unlike that on Earth, but it is also resides in a place that is unlike Earth.\nFirst published on The Conversation.

It’s also “inevitable” that alien life exists in the universe given the preponderance of extrasolar planets that are being discovered — it’s up to us to seek out the extraterrestrial biosignatures.\nThese conclusions are outlined by Sara Seager, Professor of Planetary Science and Physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), in a paper published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on Aug. 4.\n“In the coming decade or two, we will have a lucky handful of potentially habitable exoplanets with atmospheres that can be observed in detail with the next generation of sophisticated space telescopes,” writes Seager, pointing out that NASA’s James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and a planned direct-imaging space telescope will be able to seek out biosignatures (i.e. chemicals created by extraterrestrial biology) in the atmospheres of nearby exoplanets. The JWST is set for launch in 2018.\n“Life can be inferred by the presence of atmospheric biosignature gases — gases produced by life that can accumulate to detectable levels in an exoplanet atmosphere,” she writes.\nTo date, a handful of exoplanetary atmospheres have been studied through the analysis of their host star’s light passing through their atmospheres. As an alien world orbits its star, from our perspective, it may block some of the starlight from view and be registered as a “transit.” The transit method is used by NASA’s Kepler space telescope and has so far confirmed the detection of hundreds of exoplanets. But this method can also help us analyze the chemicals contained in exoplanetary atmospheres.\nDuring a transit, if that exoplanet has an atmosphere, some of the starlight is filtered through its atmosphere. Some wavelengths of that light are absorbed by specific chemicals, leaving a spectroscopic ‘fingerprint’ in the starlight we detect. Although only the largest class of exoplanets have so far had their atmospheres analyzed in this way (gas giants with tight orbits around their stars known as “hot-Jupiters”), Seager argues that with the advent of advanced space telescopes, the composition of smaller worlds’ atmospheres could also studied. Habitable “super-Earths” fall into this category.\nOnce this happens, we can begin to observe small rocky worlds, potentially detecting spectroscopic signatures of chemicals associated with life.\nAlthough the next generation of space telescopes may be able to detect biosignatures in nearby exoplanets, Seager urges caution.\n“(M)any different gases are produced by life, but the anticipated diversity of exoplanet atmosphere composition and host star environments may yield different detectable biosignature gases than the terrestrial examples. Even with excellent data, false positives will drive a permanent ambiguity in many cases,” she adds.\nMolecules such as methane can be generated through biological (methanogenic) and geological (volcanic) processes, so the detection of methane in an exoplanetary atmosphere may not indicate life. To find out what is generating that gas, astronomers will need to study the atmosphere in its entirety to avoid jumping to conclusions about that world’s biological potential. The identification of these “false positives,” using advanced instrumentation, will be critical when seeking out genuine biosignatures.\nThe advances in space-based observatories are tantalizing and, with the launch of JWST and other advanced direct imaging telescopes (such as the “star shade” concept), we could start studying small habitable worlds with atmospheres and teasing hints as to any biosignatures within the next couple of decades.\nBut to fully investigate this exciting class of exoplanet, “we require the ability to directly image exoplanets orbiting 1,000 or more of the nearest sun-like stars.” Such an endeavor would require a huge space-borne observatory — an optical telescope with a diameter exceeding 10 meters. Considering the Hubble Space Telescope is only 2.4 meters in diameter, the exoplanetary atmosphere telescopes of the future will require some huge innovative leaps before they become a reality.\nOne thing seems certain, however. The longer we gaze into the stars, the more certain we become about the possibility for life beyond Earth.\n“Our own Galaxy has 100 billion stars, and our Universe has upwards of 100 billion galaxies — making the chance for life elsewhere seem inevitable based on sheer probability,” writes Seager. “We can say with certainty that, for the first time in human history, we are finally on the verge of being able to search for signs of life beyond our solar system around the nearest hundreds of stars.”\nvia The Guardian"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:009bb144-392e-486b-b6e6-c21e7018664e>","<urn:uuid:cc1685cf-3414-4001-9237-220a29dbfb93>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between the current threats facing seagrass meadows versus mangrove forests in coastal ecosystems?","answer":"Seagrass meadows face multiple persistent threats from both land and sea, including land runoff, coastal development, boat damage, and trawling, with evidence showing continued and extensive losses. Their coastal distribution makes them particularly vulnerable to these multiple threats. In contrast, while mangroves also face threats, their primary challenges are more specifically focused on aquaculture, agriculture, and urban development, with new deforestation frontiers emerging in Southeast Asia and West Africa. The management of these threats also differs: seagrass protection policies are currently insufficient and require urgent action, while mangrove conservation has gained substantial momentum with greater public and government awareness leading to improved outcomes, though conservation gains are not evenly distributed globally.","context":["Conservation of seagrass vital for Worlds biggest fisheries\nRapid global population is increasing the demand for seafood. This is both a desire from communities of increased wealth to eat healthy food, as well as a daily nutritional necessity for many hundreds of millions of people. To deal with this demand we need to ensure that fisheries stocks are sustainably managed into the future. The problem is that policies and plans designed to make sure there are enough fish and invertebrates almost exclusively target fishing activity. But new research is showing how we also need to protect the critical habitats such as seagrass that are essential for the sustainability of these stocks and fisheries.\nThe majority of marine animals require more than a single habitat to live and thrive, and some specifies have specific habitat requirements to increase their chances of survival and the fitness of the population. For example Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) spends its adult life shoaling in deep water where it lives, feeds and spawns. But juveniles require more stable habitat such as seagrass meadows. So, if we want to manage fish and invertebrate stocks for sustainability reasons, it is essential to protect the supporting habitats of targeted species.\nSeagrass meadows are just one of these critical habitats. Though it is clear that seagrasses are a vital part of ocean ecosystems, until now, there has been no information on the role that meadows play in supporting the productivity of world fisheries. We have now published the first quantitative global evidence on the significant roles that seagrasses play. Our latest research has determined that one-fifth of the world’s most landed fish, including Atlantic Cod and Walleye Pollack, benefit from the persistence of extensive seagrass meadows. This is because these species use seagrass as nursery habitat. Nursery grounds in seagrass meadows are a safer, less exposed, environment for eggs to be laid and young animals to find food and protection from predators as they grow.\nOur newly published research also finds that it is not just large scale fishing industries that benefit from the presence of seagrass meadows. Seagrasses are also exploited directly as a fishing ground. This is because they are an easily accessible fishing ground, small scale artisanal and subsistence fisheries around the world also use them. This includes fishers walking at low tide collecting invertebrates from these productive and extensive habitats. This is often done by women and children, and provides a source of essential protein and income for some of the most vulnerable people in tropical coastal communities. It is a common and increasingly visible activity, but it is not usually included in fishery statistics and rarely considered in resource management strategies.\nThe coastal distribution of seagrass means that it is vulnerable to a multitude of threats from both land and sea. These include land runoff, coastal development, boat damage and trawling. Evidence is increasingly emerging of continued and extensive seagrass loss around the world. The importance of seagrass meadows for fisheries productivity and hence food security is not reflected by the policies currently in place to protect these key habitats. Urgent action is needed if we want to continue enjoying the benefits that healthy and productive seagrass meadows provide.\nIn our new research paper we explain how fisheries management must be broadened from just targeting fishing activity to also targeting the habitats on which fisheries depend. Awareness of the role of seagrass in global fisheries production -- and, so, food security -- must be central to any policy, and major manageable threats to seagrass, such as declining water quality, must be dealt with. Seagrass can be a resilient and supportive habitat -- but only if we take action to continue to enjoy the benefits it provides.","More than a decade ago, a team of mangrove experts warned that mangrove forests were being lost faster than almost any other ecosystem, including coral reefs and tropical rainforests. Nonetheless, the situations are getting better now. An international team of 22 researchers led by National University Singapore (NUS) from 24 institutes including Dr Stefano Cannicci from The Swire Institute of Marine Science and School of Biological Sciences, the University of Hong Kong (HKU), found that there is now cause for optimism, with the global loss rate of mangrove forests less alarming than previously suggested.\nAfter studying various earlier presented works, the team found that globally, mangrove loss rates have reduced by almost an order of magnitude between the late 20th and early 21st century – from what was previously estimated at 1% to 3% per year, to about 0.3% to 0.6%. The drastic drop in the loss rate is attributed greatly to the successful mangrove conservation efforts. This heightens conservation optimism amongst broader projections of environmental decline.\nA commentary summarising the team’s findings was published in the scientific journal Current Biology. This international effort was the result of the Fifth International Mangrove Macrobenthos and Management conference (MMM5), the world’s largest mangrove conference which was held for the first time in Singapore last year.\n“The team deduced that the reduction in mangrove global loss rates has resulted from improved monitoring and data access, changing industrial practices, expanded management and protection, increased focus on rehabilitation, and stronger recognition of the ecosystem services provided by mangroves,” explained Associate Professor Daniel Friess from the Department of Geography of NUS.\nDr Cannicci from HKU said: “I am very proud of being one of the academics who warned about world mangrove loss a decade ago, since I think that the paper published at that time contributed to a turn the tide on mangrove degradation. There are still dangers and we still have to manage and preserve mangroves worldwide, but the perception about their importance for humankind has definitely changed. In particular, a recent survey held in Hong Kong by me showed that mangroves area in Hong Kong has increased in the last 20 years and that these ecosystems are huge reservoirs of crab, mollusca and insect diversity.”\nDr Cannicci said the data discussed in the present paper strongly support the need to implement good practices in conservations, also for Hong Kong mangroves. He remarked: “Although small and limited in size, HK mangroves harbour a magnificent diversity of plant and animal species. Eight species of trees, 53 species of crabs and 42 species of snails have been recorded in these forests, which is more than is known for the mangrove forests of the whole African continent.”\nAfter years of degradation, mangroves in Hong Kong now cover about 350 ha (Hong Kong Island has an area of about 7859 ha). Distributed across about 40 forests, they represent the largest remaining mangrove patch within the Pearl River Delta, with the largest one distributed along the coast of Deep Bay. There are also many small, but pristine patches in the North East New territories and a small one located on Hong Kong Island.\nPositive change in mangrove conservation\nMangrove forests occur along the shorelines of more than 100 countries and are incredibly important as they offer numerous critical benefits to people, including protection from coastal erosion and storm as well as cyclone damage, natural filters for pollution and sediment, carbon sequestration which helps to mitigate climate change, and provide millions of people with products such as fuelwood, construction materials and fisheries resources, since mangroves act as nursing grounds for many coastal fishes.\n“There is strong evidence that positive conservation change is occurring. Mangrove conservation has gained substantial momentum, with greater public and government awareness leading to investment and on-the-ground action. However, despite recent mangrove conservation successes, tempered optimism is necessary, as conservation gains are not evenly spread, nor guaranteed into the future,” cautioned Associate Professor Friess.\nMangroves under threat in emerging deforestation frontiers\nThe team found that mangroves continue to be threatened by aquaculture, agriculture and urban development across the world, particularly for new deforestation frontiers that are emerging throughout parts of Southeast Asia and West Africa. Southeast Asia is a traditional hot spot of mangrove deforestation as mangroves are cut down to make space for aquaculture ponds, cleared for rice paddy cultivation, and reclaimed for industrial and port development.\n“Emerging deforestation frontiers need to be addressed early. Improved environmental governance and increased public intervention can help secure positive conservation outcomes in these locations. We need to take decisive steps to improve the success and scale of mangrove rehabilitation, and increase the resilience of mangroves to sea-level rise to maintain the current progress in mangrove conservation,” commented Dr Candy Feller from the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center, one of the contributors to the study.\nMaintaining current progress in mangrove conservation\nEven mangrove rehabilitation is lauded as a method to offset historical as well as ongoing losses and can yield long-term ecosystem service provision, the team found that successful rehabilitation is still a challenge to achieve at scale. Current mangrove rehabilitation projects around the world can fail because key ecological thresholds and rehabilitation best practices are ignored – for instance, planting in low-intertidal locations that are not suitable for mangrove growth and using non-native species that can quickly become invasive, which gives rise to myriad ecological impacts on the intertidal zone.\n“Ensuring that mangrove conservation gains are not short-lived will require continued research, policy attention, and renewed efforts to improve the success of mangrove rehabilitation at a scale that will be ecologically impactful,” said Dr Erik Yando, Research Fellow at the NUS Department of Geography.\nTo ensure that the mangrove conservation gains are not short-lived, continued research, policy attention, and renewed efforts to improve the success of mangrove rehabilitation at a scale are required. The international team will continue to monitor mangrove deforestation and conduct studies to assess the benefits and values of mangroves in Southeast Asia.\n(The press release is adapted from the press release of NUS)\nImage download: www.scifac.hku.hk/press\nThe article: “Mangroves give cause for conservation optimism, for now” in Current Biology\nLink of the article: https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(19)31687-2\nFor more information about Dr Stefano Cannicci’s research, please visit: https://www.imeco-lab.com/\nFor media enquiries, please contact Ms Cindy Chan, Assistant Communications Director of Faculty of Science (Tel: 3971 5286; email: email@example.com) or Dr Stefano Cannicci from The Swire Institute of Marine Science and School of Biological Sciences, The University of Hong Kong(email: firstname.lastname@example.org).\n團隊把研究結果比對之前的數據，發現20世紀末至21世紀初，全球紅樹林減少的速度減慢了大約十倍，由之前估計每年減少1%至3%，下調到0.3%至0.6%。研究結果已於學術期刊 《當代生物學》（Current Biology）發表。\n新加坡國立大學地理學系副教授 Daniel Friess解釋研究結果說：「專家小組推斷，全球紅樹林減少的速度放緩，是由於多方面的因素，包括在監察和數據搜集上有所改善，工業作業方式的轉變，林木管理及保護工作得以擴大，人們對修復保育的關注增加，以及對於紅樹林對生態系統的貢獻的認知加强等，都有積極正面的影響。」\n研究團隊成員、 Smithsonian Environmental Research Center 的Candy Feller 博士表示：「有關機構應盡快停止在紅樹林的開發行為並加強環境管制，希望可以為這些地區的保育帶來正面影響。除此之外，我們應該採取有效手段去修復紅樹林，提升它們對水位上升的防禦力。」\n有關文章: “Mangroves give cause for conservation optimism, for now” —- 《當代生物學》\n有關Stefano Cannicci 博士的研究可參閱以下網址：https://www.imeco-lab.com/"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:61b732ca-1935-4ee7-a1bf-6f59f961861d>","<urn:uuid:02e627f7-6d61-484f-b2ca-6010a0285dbd>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What were Jesus's last words on the cross according to Luke's account?","answer":"According to Luke's account, Jesus's last words on the cross were 'Father, into your hands I commend my spirit.' This prayer showed Jesus voluntarily offering Himself to God as a sacrifice, demonstrating that He chose when to give up His life rather than having it taken from Him.","context":["Today’s readings are from Exodus 20; Luke 23; Job 38 and 2 Corinthians 8.\nExodus 20:1-17 is the first giving of the Ten Commandments (cf. Deut. 5). These ten “words” can be divided either four and six, the first four dealing with our vertical relationship with God (“love the Lord your God with all your heart…soul…mind”) and the last six dealing with our horizontal relationships with mankind (“love your neighbor as yourself”). However, some divide it five and five.\nNotice that the commandments are prefaced by Exodus 19 (“I carried you on eagle’s wings) and Exodus 20:1-2, which tells Israel who God is and what He has done for them. We always have to be careful to keep the indicative before the imperative in Scripture. This is why Paul’s epistles generally have several doctrinal chapters explaining to his readers what God has done for them before he ever gets to the commands detailing what we must do for God. We are not saved by works, by keeping the commandments. We are saved through the work of Jesus Christ on the cross, and now we obey out of glad and grateful hearts.\nWhile we are no longer “under the law” (Romans 6:14) as believers, these commands are helpful for us as a way to flesh out what it means to love God and love our neighbor.\nWhen God says, “You shall have no other gods before me,” on the positive side He is saying, “You have me!”\nWhen God tells Israel not to make or worship images, on the positive side He is saying, you know all about me from the Word.\nOf course, some commands, like “do not murder” and “do not commit adultery” are fleshed out more deeply in the Sermon on the Mount, so that murder and lust also violate these commandments.\nTruly, we cannot keep the commandments, and thus the law condemns us and our only recourse is to run to the cross.\nJesus fulfilled the law for us, so we could obey it in Him: That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. (Romans 8:4)\n“The great message of the Christian faith is, therefore, that we are free from the Law’s condemnation in order that we may be able to fulfill its obligation by the power of [Jesus] within us.” (Alan Redpath)\nThe response of Israel to the ten commandments was somewhat sad:\n18 Now when all the people saw the thunder and the flashes of lightning and the sound of the trumpet and the mountain smoking, the people were afraid and trembled, and they stood far off 19 and said to Moses, “You speak to us, and we will listen; but do not let God speak to us, lest we die.” 20 Moses said to the people, “Do not fear, for God has come to test you, that the fear of him may be before you, that you may not sin.” 21 The people stood far off, while Moses drew near to the thick darkness where God was.\nOut of fear, the people gave up their own opportunity to enter God’s presence personally, and asked Moses to be their proxy, their go-between. It is similar to people today depending only upon paid professionals to read and explain God’s Word to them. They miss out on the joys of hearing God’s voice personally.\nWe already have a Mediator, Jesus Christ (1 Tim. 2:4), who takes care of all our condemnation so that we can enjoy a personal, face-to-face, heart-to-heart relationship with God through Jesus.\nHebrews 4:16 Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.\nHebrews 10:22 let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.\nTom Constable explains how the final verses of chapter 20 introduce the regulations to come.\nThis pericope serves as an introduction to 42 judgments in 21:1—23:12. A similar section to this introduction, following the 42 judgments section, repeats the emphases of the introduction and forms a conclusion to the judgments (23:13-19).\n|Prohibition of idolatry\nProper forms of worship\n|Prohibition of idolatry\nProper forms of worship\nThis chapter ends with regulations for making and serving at an altar.\nYahweh permitted His people to build commemorative worship altars at the locations where He granted special theophanies, that is, manifestations of His presence. These were in addition to the altars at Israel’s central sanctuary (the tabernacle and later the temple; cf. Judg. 6:25-27; 13:15-20; 1 Sam. 9:11-14; 16:1-5; 1 Kings 18:30-40). They were to build these special altars, both for formal worship and for special occasions (e.g., Josh. 8:30; Judg. 6:25-26), out of earth or uncut stone.\nLuke 23 begins with Jesus’ trial before Pilate and Herod (23:1-25). He bounces back and forth between Pilate (23:1-7 and 13-25) and Herod (23:8-12). Both the leaders and the people are responsible for Jesus’ crucifixion.\nThe light green line shows Jesus being taken from the house of Caiaphas to Pilate (at David’s Citadel). Ferrell Jenkin’s blog has a picture of some steps Jesus might have taken.\nThis is a picture from Bible Walks (Todd Bolen), showing the Armenian Church. Underneath this church is possibly where Jesus stood before Caiaphas.\nA model of Herod’s Palace\nThe white line represents Jesus being taken from Pilate to Herod (Hasmonean Palace).\nThe yellow line is Jesus going back to Pilate.\nThe green line is the pathway from Pilate’s condemnation to the cross.\n(All the above maps are from gospeldevotions.wordpress.com, Luke 23)\nLuke’s account of the crucifixion (23:26-49) includes a prophecy of the fate of Jerusalem (vv. 29-31), more emphasis on the men who experienced crucifixion with Jesus (vv. 39-43), and less reporting on the crowd that mocked Jesus. It climaxes with Jesus’ final prayer of trust in His Father (v. 46), and the reactions of various people to His death (vv. 47-49).\nWhere was Jesus crucified? All four gospels mention a place…\nMatthew 27:33 …they came to a place called Golgotha, which means Place of a Skull…\nMark 15:22 Then they brought Jesus to the place called Golgotha, which means the place of a skull.\nLuke 23:32 When they came to the place that is called The Skull, they crucified Jesus there with the criminals, one on his right and one on his left.\nJohn 19:17 So they took Jesus, and carrying the cross by himself he went out to what is called The Place of the Skull, which in Hebrew (Aramaic) is called Golgotha. 18 There they crucified him with two others, one on either side, with Jesus between them.\nThere is a place west of Jerusalem that could be the place, although scholars disagree.\nDavid Guzik reminds us…\nDuring the 12 hours between 9 p.m. Thursday and 9 a.m. Friday, Jesus suffered many things, both physically and in the high-stress challenges that took a toll on Him physically.\ni. Jesus suffered great emotional stress in the Garden of Gethsemane, as indicated when His sweat became like great drops of blood (Luke22:44). “Although this is a very rare phenomenon, bloody sweat (hematidrosis or hemohidrosis) may occur in highly emotional states or in persons with bleeding disorders. As a result of hemorrhage into the sweat glands, the skin becomes fragile and tender.” (Edwards)\nii. Jesus suffered the emotional stress of abandonment by His disciples.\niii. Jesus suffered a severe physical beating at the home of the high priest.\niv. Jesus suffered a sleepless night.\nv. Jesus suffered, being forced to walk more than two and a half miles.\nvi. All of these factors made Jesus especially vulnerable to the effects of scourging.\nvii. Then he was scourged.\nviii. He was too weak to carry his own cross very far.\nix. He was crucified.\nThe first words Luke records from Jesus’ mouth while on the cross was “Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they do.” After all that Jesus had already suffered, and now the cross with its excruciating pain and shame, Jesus thinks not of himself, but of others.\n“Jesus crucified is the touchstone revealing what the world is: ‘The people stood beholding’ in stolid indifference; the rulers, who wanted religion but without a divine Christ crucified for their sins, mocked (Mt. 27:41); the brutal ‘railed at him’ (v. 39), i.e. reviled Him; the conscious sinner prayed (v. 42); and the covetous sat down before the cross and played their sordid game (Mt. 27:35-36). The cross is the judgment of this world (Jn. 12:31).” (New Scofield Bible)\nRegarding the salvation of one of the thieves, Ellis says…\n“When the two malefactors were hanged beside the Lord, the one was no better than the other. . . . It is only the grace of God in the cross of Christ that can instantly transform a reviling sinner into an attitude of saving faith and confession. The repentant thief began to see (1) the justice of his own punishment (v. 41); (2) the sinless character of Christ (v. 41); (3) the Deity of Christ (v. 42); (4) a living Christ beyond the grave (v. 42); and (5) a kingdom beyond the cross, with Jesus as its coming King (v. 42).”\nLuke also records the last words of Jesus on the cross, “Father, into your hands I commend my spirit.” In this prayer, Jesus offered Himself to God as a sacrifice for the sins of the world. Jesus voluntarily laid His life down; no one took it from Him (John 10:15-18; cf. John 15:13).\nThis shows that Jesus gave up His life when He wanted to and how He wanted to. No one took His life from Him; He gave it up when His work was finished. Jesus is not a victim we should pity, but a conqueror we should admire.\nRather save your pity for those who reject the complete work of Jesus on the cross at Calvary; for those preachers who do not have the heart of Paul in 1 Corinthians 1:23, when he proclaimed the center of the Christian message: we preach Christ crucified.\nJESUS’ WORDS ON THE CROSS\n|“Father, forgive them.”||23:34|\n|“Today you shall be with me in paradise.”||23:43|\n|“Woman, behold your son,” and “Behold, your mother.”||19:26-27|\n|“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?”||27:46||15:34|\n|“It is finished.”||19:30|\n|“Father, into your hands I commend my spirit.”||27:50||23:46|\nDavid Guzik writes:\nThe tearing of the temple veil signified at least two things. First, now we have free access to the throne of grace by the cross. Second, no one should ever think again that God dwells in temples made with hands.\nThomas Constable notes:\nLuke highlighted Jesus’ innocence in a number of ways that the other Gospel writers did not. He recorded that Pilate declared Him innocent four times (vv. 4, 14, 15, 22). He also noted Herod’s testimony to Jesus’ innocence (v. 15). He contrasted Jesus’ innocence with Barabbas’ guilt (v. 25). He recorded the thief’s testimony to Jesus’ innocence (v. 41). He also included the centurion’s confession of Jesus’ innocence (v. 47). Finally he noted the reaction of the crowd, which showed that many of them believed He was innocent (v. 48). Obviously Luke wanted to convince his readers that Jesus died as an “innocent” man, not as a guilty sinner.\nLuke 23 ends with Jesus’ burial (23:50-56).\nLuke dated his action as late Friday afternoon. The “preparation (Gr. paraskeue) day” was the day before “the Sabbath,” which began at sundown on Friday.\nJesus was buried in the tomb of Joseph of Arimethea, a “rich man” according to Matthew 27:57, fulfilling Isaiah 53:9…\n9 And they made his grave with the wicked and with a rich man in his death, although he had done no violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth.\nJob 38 (finally) begins God’s address to Job.\nFinally, God spoke to Job and gave revelation that Job had been demanding for so long (cf. 13:22; 31:35). There was now no need for the middleman that Job had requested who could mediate between them (cf. 9:33; 16:19). Yahweh spoke directly to Job, and Job had the opportunity to respond directly to God.\nWhat God did not say to Job is as surprising as what He did say. He did not mention Job’s suffering, He gave no explanation of the problem of evil, He did not defend Himself against Job’s charge of injustice, and He made no comment on the retributive principle.\nGod simply revealed Himself to Job and his companions to a greater degree than they had known, and that greater revelation silenced them. He proved Himself to be the truly wise Person.\nGod’s role in His speeches was not that of a defendant on trial, whom Job the prosecutor charged with injustice. Rather, He was the Prosecutor asking the questions of Job, the defendant. Instead of giving Job answers, God asked him more than 70 unanswerable questions and proved Job both ignorant and impotent.\nSince Job could not understand or determine God’s ways with nature, he obviously could not comprehend or control God’s dealings with people. Who is the truly wise person? It is not Job, or his three older friends, or his younger friend, Elihu, but God. He alone is truly wise.\nGod’s first speech occurs in 38:1-40:2\nGod began His speech with a challenge to His opponent’s understanding, as the five human debaters on earth had done. He accused Job of clouding the truth about Him by saying things that were not true. Job should have defended God’s justice rather than denying it, since he claimed to be God’s friend. His lack of adequate revelation led to this error.\nLikewise, every believer should be slow to affirm that he knows God’s will about the affairs of an individual’s life, his own or someone else’s. We still do not know all the facts concerning why God is allowing what takes place. God then told Job to prepare for a difficult job: to explain His ways in nature. If God had done wrong, Job must have known what was right!\nSo God asks Job a series of questions in 38:4-39:30.\nAs Job’s friends had done, God began to break Job down blow by verbal blow. Finally all his pride was gone. However, where Job’s friends had failed, God succeeded.\nWith regard to the created world and the animal world, Job could not explain how they came into existence or how they experience life. Neither could Job explain the mysteries of creation (38:4-7), the boundaries of the sea (38:8-11), the nature of the earth (38:12-17), the nature of light and darkness (38:18-24), the nature of rain (38:25-30), the constellations (38:31-33), nor the clouds and weather and the human mind (38:34-38), nor could Job understand or master the animal kingdom (38:39-41).\nGod’s first speech began and ended with a challenge to Job. Job had found fault with God for allowing him to suffer when he was godly. He had said he wished he could meet God in court to face Him with His injustice and to hear His response (13:3, 15). Now God asked Job if he still wanted to contend with Him after God had reminded him of His power and wisdom.\n“Since Job is not knowledgeable enough to discover why things take place on earth as they do, he is left with a decision—either to trust Yahweh, believing that he wisely rules his created world, or to pursue his complaint that exalts himself above Yahweh. Yahweh leaves the initiative with Job either to believe him or to continue to accuse him.“\nJob’s first response to God is that he was dumbfounded. Earlier he had wanted to challenge God in court; now he has nothing to say.\n2 Corinthians 8-9 gives some wonderful principles of giving. Since it is “more blessed to give than to receive” it is vital that we gain insight into giving.\n- Giving is totally due to grace, not law (8:4, 6, 7, 9, 16, 19; 9:8, 14). See also 8:8 and 9:7.\n- First give yourself to God (8:5).\n- Give in response to Christ’s giving to you (8:9).\n- Give from sincere desire (8:8).\n- Give as much as you are able, and even beyond (8:3, 11, 12).\n- Give joyfully (8:2; 9:7).\n- Giving is a result of spiritual growth (8:7) and leads to growth (9:8-11)"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5c55a3a3-8fb6-45bb-9915-589402f67eaf>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How to start aquatic physical therapy?","answer":"To start aquatic physical therapy, you need a physician (MD) referral first. Then you'll be scheduled for a physical therapy evaluation. After the evaluation, you'll receive an orientation to the pool area and be scheduled for follow-up visits in aquatic therapy. Note that you don't need to know how to swim, but should be comfortable in water up to 5 feet deep.","context":["Frequently Asked Questions\nWhat is physical therapy?\nPhysical therapy is treatment to improve mobility (such as walking, going up stairs, or getting in and out of bed), to relieve pain and to restore physical function and overall fitness. The physical therapist uses exercise, manual therapy, education, and modalities such as heat, cold, aquatic therapy, and electrical stimulation to work toward these goals. Depending on the injury, disease, or condition, physical therapy may include work on flexibility, strength, endurance, coordination, or balance. Treatment may focus on preventing problems or on treating problems.\nWhat is Occupational Therapy?\nIn its simplest terms, occupational therapists help people across the life span participate in the things they want and need to do through the therapeutic use of everyday activities (occupations). Common occupational therapy interventions include helping children with disabilities participate fully in school and social situations, helping people recovering from injury regain skills, and providing supports for older adults experiencing physical and cognitive changes.\nOccupational therapy services may include recommendations for adaptive equipment and training in its use, and guidance and education for family members and caregivers. Occupational therapists have a holistic perspective in which the focus is on adapting the environment to fit the person, and the person is an integral part of the therapy team.\nWhat Is language? What is speech?\nLanguage is different from speech.\nLanguage is made up of socially shared rules that include the following: vocabulary / word meaning (e.g., “star” can refer to a bright object in the night sky or a celebrity); word roots/parts that add meaning (e.g., friend, friendly, unfriendly); syntax or how to put words together (e.g., “Peg walked to the new store” rather than “Peg walk store new”); and use of language (that is, what word combinations are best in what situations, as in “Would you mind moving your foot?” could quickly change to “Get off my foot, please!” if the first request did not produce results).\nSpeech is the verbal means of communicating. Speech consists of the following: Articulation (that is, how speech sounds are made (e.g., children must learn how to produce the “r” sound in order to say “rabbit” instead of “wabbit”); Voice (that is, the use of the vocal folds and breathing to produce sound, which at times may sound hoarse ); Fluency : The rhythm of speech (e.g., hesitations or stuttering can affect fluency).\nWhen a person has trouble understanding others (receptive language), or sharing thoughts, ideas, and feelings completely (expressive language), then he or she has a language disorder.\nWhen a person is unable to produce speech sounds correctly or fluently, or has problems with his or her voice, then he or she has a speech disorder.\nWhat do I need to bring to my appointment?\nYou need to bring:\n• A copy of your insurance card\n• Any relevant medical documents. For example, surgery reports, x-ray, MRI, school reports, IEP, prior therapy evaluations, and notes from other providers if available\n• List of medications\n• A referral with reason for physical, occupational therapy, or speech therapy with name, diagnosis (ICD-10), and date of birth on referral. Referrals may be brought to the appointment, entered into our electronic system by your primary care doctor, or faxed to the location where you will be seen.\n• Previous home exercise programs. If you have previously received individualized exercises from another therapist or visiting nurse services, it is very helpful to your outpatient PT to know where you are starting in terms of your exercise program. Written instructions are always welcome for review.\nWhat can I expect on my first visit?\nA patient’s first visit with the therapist is usually about one hour. Please arrive 15 minutes early to complete the insurance and medical history information we need. Your therapist will take a thorough history and baseline measurements. You may be asked to change into a hospital gown for the examination. After the therapy examination, the therapist will develop a plan of care to meet your individual goals and to establish how often and for how long therapy may be indicated. This is a collaborative process, and your input will be integrated into the plan.\nDo I need to know how to swim?\nYou do not need to know how to swim but should be comfortable in a pool that ranges in depths up to 5 feet. We offer separate Swimming Classes.\nIs aquatic therapy billed as physical therapy?\nYes. Aquatic therapy is really aquatic physical therapy. It is a skilled service with direct care from a licensed therapist, so your insurer will be billed for physical therapy services. Swimming Classes are reimbursable by some insurances. Please contact us for more info.\nHow do I get into Aquatic PT?\nYou need an MD referral to be scheduled for a PT evaluation.

{"question":"What is the scientific evidence for the importance of early nurturing care in child development, and how does this relate to current work-family balance statistics in the United States?","answer":"Scientific evidence shows that nurturing care in the first three years is crucial for developing trust, empathy, and affection. Research demonstrates that maternal behavior affects gene expression, stress responses, and temperament in infants. Studies can even predict children's aggressive behavior at age two-and-a-half based on mother-infant interactions at six months. The mirror neuron system, discovered in the 1990s, helps explain how infants develop empathy and language through imitation. However, U.S. work-family balance statistics reveal concerning trends: 66% of Americans feel their work-family life is out of balance, nearly 12% work over 50 hours weekly, and 33% work at least one weekend day. This creates significant barriers to providing the necessary nurturing care, as Americans have about 4 hours less per day for family and leisure compared to countries with better work-family balance.","context":["by Catherine H. Myers\nChildren have essential needs for nurturing care and time with their parents. Unfortunately, many aspects of mainstream culture create barriers to meeting children’s needs. Scientific studies are providing abundant proof of children’s needs—but it is difficult to change cultural practices, attitudes and policies.\n“Nothing is more important in the world today than the nurturing that children receive in the first three years of life, for it is in these earliest years that the capacities for trust, empathy, and affection originate,” said Dr. Elliott Barker in the mid-1980s. Dr. Barker came to his understanding of the importance of nurturing in early childhood through his experiences as a psychiatrist interviewing criminal psychopaths. He is the founder of the Canadian Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.1\nIn 1997, at a White House Conference on Infant and Child Development, none of the assembled experts answered the President's question: \"What specific types of experiences are most important and how much of each of them is necessary?\" In 2000, renowned children's doctors and researchers T. Berry Brazelton and Stanley I. Greenspan responded with their book, The Irreducible Needs of Children: What Every Child Must Have to Grow, Learn and Flourish. The first of the seven needs described by Brazelton and Greenspan—the need for ongoing, nurturing relationships—has enormous effects on emotional, social, cognitive and physical development.2\nBrazelton and Greenspan point to nurturing's essential role in human evolution: \"We often associate human evolution with survival of the fittest, species competing with one another for survival. However, there is another trend, one that doesn't often get associated with evolution per se, but may be a very important component of our development as human beings. This aspect of evolution has to do with the human being's capacity to form families and co-operate in larger social organizations. ...Advanced societies, in order to compete economically and militarily and through stable government structures, require nurturing care for the children who will become the adults. In essence behind the competitive advantage in evolution, lies nurturing care.\"3 (For more on nurturing and evolution, please see the 2004 book by Dr. Greenspan and philosopher Stuart G. Shanker, The First Idea: How Symbols, Language, and Intelligence Evolved from our Primate Ancestors to Modern Humans.)4\nA huge and rapidly growing body of scientific evidence documents the importance of the first three years of life, and the significance of the quality of the intimate, two-way communicative relationship between mother and infant. Large-scale population studies led by Vincent A. Felitti, M.D. and Robert F. Anda, M.D. show that adverse experiences in childhood are associated with serious mental and physical health problems in adulthood.5\nResearchers' empirical evidence shows the influence of the mother-infant relationship on mental and physiological traits in the infant.6 Here are a few examples of this research:\n- By observing the behavior of mothers interacting with their six-month-old infants, researchers can predict children’s aggressive behavior at age two-and-a-half.7\n- Maternal behavior affects the expression of genes in the infant: although it was once thought that infants were born with a certain temperament, recent research shows that a mother’s behavior can influence her child’s temperament.8\n- A mother’s behavior has a strong influence on an infant’s physiological response to stress and novelty. Our bodies' response to stress (heart rate and respiration) is not set at birth, but it settles into a life-long pattern by the age of one year.9\nResearchers’ understandings are moving from a view of temperament as inborn and relatively stable to a view of temperament as much more fluid, influenced in utero by mother’s biological state, shaped by the experience of intimate relationships and subject to change throughout early childhood. And studies of the interactions between children’s genes and parenting have demonstrated that some children’s genetic inheritance makes them more susceptible to the behavior of their parents. This higher sensitivity can turn out to be beneficial, or it can be harmful, depending on the quality of the parenting the child receives. This research also helps to explain some confusing results from prior research: some children manage to develop into reasonably health adults in spite of their parents' poor behavior, while other children develop serious problems. Researchers speculate that high susceptibility to parental influence is an evolutionary advantage to societies, so that some people are quicker to adapt their behavior while the majority is less easily influenced.10\nIn 1977, psychologists Andrew Meltzoff and M. Keith Moore described neonates’ imitation of facial expressions.11 Since then, many researchers have gathered evidence of a wide range of imitative behaviors carried out by infants and young children. But it wasn’t until the 1990s that researchers discovered a system of interconnected neurons involved in imitation. First discovered in monkeys, mirror neurons in humans have now been examined with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technology. Mirror neurons are found in the inferior frontal cortex, the insula and the amygdala. The mirror neuron system has been shown to help people imitate the actions of others and to understand others’ feelings; this system is also involved in the ability to understand the actions of others and to predict the intentions of others. The mirror neuron system is a likely explanation of the physiological mechanism involved in infant’s imitative behavior, including imitation involved in the development of language and empathy.12\nThe human capacity to conceptualize abstract and complex thoughts, and to relate to others with empathy only develops fully if an infant is given adequate nurturing. What exactly is “adequate” – and what does “nurturing” mean? One way to understand the need for adequate nurturing is to observe what happens when there is a lack of nurturing. Scientists studying the effects of too-little nurturing are illuminating the need for this hard-to-observe, hard-to-measure, hard even to define, element of our humanity.\nRobert Sapolsky, drawing on his decades of experience researching stress, says, “Something roughly akin to love is needed for proper biological development, and its absence is among the most aching, distorting stressors that we can suffer.”13\nDevelopmental scientist Hanus Papousek, analyzing fractions of seconds of mother-infant interaction captured on videotapes, documented intricate emotional exchanges that operated at parents’ subconscious levels. These mother-infant communications, which Hanus and Mechthild Papousek called “intuitive parenting,” included elements of play and music. They theorized that these behaviors were selected through evolution, aiming “not only at the hygienic, autonomic, and emotional needs of infants, but also at the needs to be together with someone, to share experience, to acquire adequate means of communication, and to create novel symbols—needs that seldom appear in the literature on children.” Another term the Papouseks use in describing mother-infant behavior is “intimate, two-way communicative musicality.”14\nHuman infants are born with the “expectation of being loved and lovingly cared for” writes psychoanalyst Elisabeth Young-Bruehl. She notes the Japanese word amae, “the expectation to be sweetly and indulgently loved” and suggests as the closest English equivalent the phrase “the need for cherishment.” Denying this need \"in children and in ourselves as adults who continue to feel that elemental need\" leads to what Young-Bruehl terms \"childism,\" a violation of human rights.15\nAs Drs. Brazelton and Greenspan assert, meeting children's need for “ongoing nurturing relationships,” is essential “to build capacities for trust, empathy, and compassion.” Greenspan writes, “… we can't experience the consistency and intimacy of ongoing love unless we've had that experience with someone in our lives. …This basic feature of caring relationships between a baby and a caregiver who really knows her over the long haul is responsible for a surprisingly large number of vital mental capacities. The interactions that are necessary [to regulate behavior, moods, feelings, and intellectual development] can take place in full measure only with a loving caregiver who has lots of time to devote to a child.”\nBrazelton and Greenspan note that spending time together benefits not only infants, but parents too. Parents need time to learn about their infants, and as they learn they gain confidence in their own abilities. Acknowledging that non-parental care may be highly desirable or absolutely necessary in some circumstances, the doctors insist, \"In the first three years, every child needs one or two primary caregivers who remain in a steady, intimate relationship with that child.\" And concerning daycare the doctors say, \"We do not recommend full-time day care, 30 or more hours of care [per week] by nonparents, for infants and toddlers if the parents are able to provide high-quality care themselves and if the parents have reasonable options.\" Brazelton and Greenspan express confidence in parents' ability to make good decisions about time and caregiving, once they have reliable information about children's needs.\nLooking at the big picture and citing the urgent need for international cooperation and interdependency across national boundaries, the doctors remind us that \"in order to protect the future for one child, we must protect it for all.\" As they point out, \"Only secure, well-nurtured individuals are capable of joining together and embracing a broader ethic of shared humanity.\"16\nLove, cherishment and intimate two-way communication are essential elements of intimate, nurturing relationships. In order to establish and maintain these relationships, parents and infants need generous amounts of time together.\n© by Catherine H. Myers","Understanding What Is Meant By Work-Life Balance\nWork-Family or Work-Life balance is a term that has been used by many scholars, experts, and legislators with many meanings throughout the years. Though a specific definition may not be immediately forthcoming, the general idea behind these terms is the balance or ratio between time spent working and time spent with loved ones, in recreation or leisure, relaxation, or pursuing hobbies.\nFor this article, we are going to focus primarily on the family aspect, and most particularly, the ways in which the relationship between working parents and their offspring affects the health and psychology of all family members.\nThe ways in which a workplace may impact home and family life are numerous and often differ depending on the very identity and role of the worker and family involved.\nWhen a workplace or a family necessitates a choice between investing more time one or the other - else a consequence will be suffered - that is a work-family conflict. When those conflicts become the norm for an employee, that employee would be said to be experiencing work-family or work-life imbalance.\nThough the term work-life balance is more broad, generally the same issues that would cause conflict between work and life are the same as those that create conflict between work and family. In “Work Life Balance”, a book by Janice Arenofsky, this broad issue is explored in greater depth than could be possible here. Arenofsky identifies in the text several origins of work-life imbalance; gender roles, financial pressures, family values, work-family conflict, personal goals, home problems, and co-workers are each identified as a major source of work-life and work-family imbalance\nEssentially, work-family imbalance emerges when a job consumes too much effort or time - whether physically or mentally - for adequate effort and time to be given to family life.\nA Glimpse Into Work-Family Balance In The United States\nDeveloping a culture within a company is imperative to the health of the employees and the progress of the company. The same is true of a nation. Just as those companies with the most attractive benefits, nurturing culture, and considerate expectations attract the best and generate the most stable and dedicated workforces. In fact, it could be argued that, more than attracting the best talent, businesses with good company mindset, good benefits, and a compassionate general managerial approach create the best workforce. The same is true in aggregate of a nation.\nAll of these things hinge on the workplace being capable of allowing employees to have a flourishing home life, family life and recreational life. In allowing employees to have a rich home and family life is to improve their work satisfaction, ultimately increasing productivity, satisfaction, and creativity. All of this sounds intuitive, but let’s look at some supporting facts:\n- Of 38 countries surveyed, the U.S. rated 30th in work-family balance.\n- Nearly 12% of American workers dedicate over 50 hours/week to their job(s).\n- Citizens of those countries rated highest have an average of about 4 hours more each day to dedicate to themselves, their families, and leisure than the average American.\n- The average American male spends 8.35 hours/day working, while the average woman spends 7.84 hours working each day.\n- 66% of Americans feel their work-family life is out of balance.\n- 33% of Americans work at least one weekend day on average.\n- 60% of Americans say their boss directly and negatively impacts their work-family balance.\n- Nearly 40% of Americans blame constant expectations to work beyond standard hours as a primary contributor to work-family imbalance.\n- 39% of Americans say inflexibility in their hours contributes to work-family imbalance.\n- 30% of Americans blame long commutes for work-family imbalance.\n- Nearly 60% of Americans say that technology (smartphones, etc) has ruined the modern family dinner.\n- 16% of employees seeking new employment were looking because of work-family conflict, usually surrounding inflexibility in their workplace.\nWork-family imbalance precipitates negative consequences at work and at home; with those experiencing work-family imbalance more likely to suffer depression and anxiety, miss important life events, and suffer at their work as well.\nRecommended for You\nWhat We Can Learn From “The Swedish Model?\nThe nation most identified with work-family balance is Sweden.\nSwedish society has been able to make great strides to improve balance between family life and work life. Some of this is cultural, but more so, the foundation of the so-called “Swedish model” for work-family balance is policy.\nIn Sweden a robust government-mandated support network exists to assist parents in their caring for their children and allowing for adequate time in an employee’s life to engage with and enjoy the significant moments in a child’s life. Beyond legislation, there is also a contribution from Swedish employers, hospitals and the healthcare network, and the greater culture - the success in work-family balance observed in Sweden and other similar nations hinges on a total commitment of the society to support working parents.\nKey elements of Swedish policy which nurture healthy working families include ample leave for parents following childbirth. 480 days of paid leave per child are offered to all new parents, the days can be split however the parents decide, with both parents getting a minimum of 90 days to bond with the child. Further, Sweden dictates that every employee is entitled to 25 days (5 working weeks) paid vacation out of every year. Offering generous vacation time gives parents adequate time to bond with their children and spouse beyond the special leave offered for parents of newborn children.\nAfter the first year, a period where Sweden has nearly all children being cared for by either one or both parents, Sweden’s policy is to cover over 90% of daycare for working parents. This policy of subsidised daycare reduces the burden on working parents. The culture in Sweden also results in less total hours of work per day and more flexibility in hours and workdays allowing more parents to be available for important events in their children’s lives.\nImporting and improving upon existing Swedish policy regarding work-family balance could do a great deal of good for the United States. Developing healthy relationships and habits outside of work makes sense economically as well as psychologically and sociologically. Workers with a healthy home and family life are more productive and less likely to fall ill and take time off. They are also far less likely to suffer from psychological turmoil. These factors improve health, creativity, and productivity.\nThough the Swedes have experienced great improvements in the gender equality of their culture, and the productivity and health of their employed population - especially those dual-income households, which make up a majority of Swedish families.\nBeyond The Swedish Model\nThough the Swedes have and do enjoy a far more copasetic balance between work life and family or home life, there are imperfections in Swedish policy. In an article presented to the U.N. in 2011, the success of certain Swedish policies are cast into doubt, justified by some issues with behavior and declining outcomes for the children as a whole as compared to the great outcomes realized during early implementation of new policies such as daycare subsidies and there extended maternal and paternal leave.\nJonas Himmelstrand, in articles on the very topic of the Swedish model, points out that some of the diminishing returns come from limitations placed on child care options - though daycare is covered 90%, home care, granny care, childminders, or relative care are not given any support. Furthermore, home-schooling is forbidden. For some children, these options are the most nurturing and develop the best outcomes - and we shouldn’t be blind to it.\nWe need to move forward as a society and realize the humanity of all of us. Not only realize it, but cease to shame it. We need to embrace our humanity and enjoy our relations with others and cease to expect of ourselves and others such a profound sacrifice in order to earn a living. We need better policies, but we also need a better corporate culture and society as a whole. We need to stop tolerating abuses of power and begin to expect and demand rational and considerate treatment for employees - including respecting work-family balance."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:66d552ac-640d-449b-99ec-c96a6e68b9ed>","<urn:uuid:6f8065c8-d022-4f4e-a94f-914d5b76b147>"],"error":null}

If you’re like us, you may be wondering the very same thing. The good news is that pet insurance has several options available, and it’s all about what works best for you.\nInjuries & Illness\nThe most common coverage that pet owners select is the injuries and illness option. This typically covers all kinds of injuries, such as broken bones, bite wounds, car accidents, swallowed objects, and burns. The illness portion of the policy covers cancer, diabetes, ear infections, urinary issues, and some dental illnesses. However, be careful with the cancer coverage. Some companies do charge extra for that option.\nAnother option for those who are looking just for the basic coverage is the injury-only plan. It’s essentially the same as above, but it takes out the illness coverage. It’s cheaper, and if you insure your pet while they’re still young, it is one of the cheapest premiums available.\nChronic and Ongoing Conditions\nThis type of insurance requires your pet to be eligible, and each insurance company’s criteria is different. To get a good idea of how pets qualify to receive benefits on chronic or ongoing conditions, contact several companies, get quotes and information on these conditions.\nHereditary and Congenital Conditions\nThese conditions are ones that pets are born with or are genetically predisposed. Most people don’t realize they can get insurance for these with most pet insurance companies. As with most things, you just have to ask and include the option in the quote.\nThere are some companies that only offer wellness care, and very little of everything else. Those types of companies should be avoided because they’re not cost-effective, nor do they provide you with enough of a benefit to make it worth your while. However, as an add-on to other insurance coverage, wellness care is quite beneficial. First of all, the wellness visits help you meet your deductible quickly. Once you do, you’ll start getting your pet’s regular visits for shots and other check-ups covered under your insurance.\nSome insurance companies offer alternative therapy coverage for those families who aren’t seeing progress through traditional means. These can include acupuncture, chiropractic care, and hydrotherapy. This is relatively new coverage, and it covers alternative therapies, so adding it on to a policy is going to make it quite a bit more expensive. Make sure it’s something you want before adding it on.\nAnother option that only some insurance companies offer is the behavioral coverage. In the event that your pet develops a behavioral issue, such as excessive licking, destructive chewing, or relieving themselves in inappropriate places, this coverage allows for consultations, exams, lab testing, and in some cases, prescription medication. Not all insurance companies offer this coverage, so if it’s something that you want, keep in mind that you may need to look at several companies before deciding.\nWhat’s Not Covered\nFiguring out what is covered by pet insurance is important, but knowing what isn’t covered is just as important, so you don’t get taken by surprise.\n- Inhumane Treatments – Many insurance companies won’t cover procedures they deem to be inhumane. This may include treatments such as tail docking, ear cropping, or claw removal.\n- Pre-existing Conditions – It’s extremely rare to find an insurance company willing to insure a pre-existing condition. In some cases, a pet can qualify for coverage if the condition is cured, and they haven’t had any symptoms for at least 180 days, but typically, insurance companies won’t take on the risk of pre-existing conditions. To be clear, pre-existing conditions are classified as those that come up before the pet is insured, or during the waiting period. It is different than hereditary or congenital conditions.\n- Fees Exceeding the “Usual and Customary” Costs – Insurance companies look into the cost of veterinary care in your area, and they use industry and proprietary data to calculate the usual and customary cost of procedures. If you tried to submit a claim that was more than these estimated costs, your claim would most likely be denied. Before you sign up for a policy, find out what the usual and customary costs are in your area. It will help you compare insurance companies so that you can make the right decision for you.\nKnowing what pet insurance covers in most cases can help you determine which policy would suit you and your pet best. By comparing information and asking questions, you begin to understand how pet insurance can impact not only your financial life, but also, how it benefits your pet. At the end of the day, if you’re considering pet insurance, you’re probably concerned about their welfare and want nothing but the best for them. Pet insurance is a great way to make sure they’re taken care of when they need it.\n- How Does Pet Insurance Work?\n- How Much Does Pet Insurance Cost?\n- Is Pet Insurance Really Worth It?\n- Benefits of Having Pet Insurance\n- What Exactly Is Pet Insurance?"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9f1ff657-939b-43ca-9f7a-68c6d62169c9>","<urn:uuid:3fd67902-0701-4722-9fe8-49470935f290>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How did the adoption of trousers in China compare to the Byzantine Empire's adoption of Greek as their official language, in terms of cultural influence and practical reasons?","answer":"Both changes were driven by practical needs and cultural influences. In China during the Han Dynasty (221-206 BCE), trousers were adopted due to the introduction of Mongolian horses and horse riding, which made trousers more practical for mobility. This adoption came through mercantile exchange flowing from West to East. In the Byzantine Empire, Greek became the official language under Emperor Heraclius in the 7th century, reflecting the empire's already established Hellenistic culture. Greek had been their everyday language for centuries, used in church, literature, and commercial transactions. Both changes represent significant cultural adaptations: trousers in China reflected the influence of nomadic horse-riding culture, while the Byzantine Empire's official use of Greek formalized their existing Hellenistic identity while maintaining their Roman political legacy.","context":["Did You Know? The Popularisation of Trousers in China and other Cross-Cultural influences reflected in Clothing\nClothing form and design and associated fashions, for both men and women, constituted a significant part of the cultural exchanged facilitated by the Silk Roads. This was particularly true between the steppe and other cultures, where a number of different garment types and design motifs coalesced to form popular fashions that combined design motifs and symbolism from many different societies. These exchanges, which could be mercantile or involve the diplomatic gifting of items of clothing, often fused design motifs, and introduced new materials into regions to create hybrid objects which could be wholly practical or imbued with meaning and reflect social status. As such clothing acted as both an element of material culture transmitted along the Silk Routes as well as a vector for the transmission of culture itself through design motifs, materials, and influences on different popular styles.\nAs the name suggests, the trade of luxury silk textiles formed a significant part of the exchange of clothing taking place along the Silk Roads. However, many different items were exchanged and in multiple directions in addition to ‘East-West’. Archaeological finds of clothing from along these routes help establish a better understanding of cultural links and contacts as well as reveal much about social structures, resource availability, and economic history of the regions encompassed by these routes. The popularity of silk textiles as clothing is a notable example, but it is by no means the only one, with exchange in clothing norms and fashions flowing in multiple directions not just from the East westwards, but with goods and ideas also running West-East, North-South, and South-North in a complex web of relations.\nIn particular, the dry climate of western China has preserved many items of clothing from along the Silk Roads including trousers, skirts, and caftans, as well as boots and leather coats and belts, often revealed during archaeological excavations. Of these finds in western China dating from the 1st century BCE to the 3rd century CE, influences from merchants and travellers from the Greco-Roman Empire, Parthia, Sogdia, and the Saka city states of the Kushan Empire at the southern side of the Tarim Basin have been identified in the numerous styles, designs, materials and clothing types uncovered.\nOne such example of mercantile exchange flowing in a West-East direction is the process of the popularisation of trousers. During the Han Dynasty (221–206 BCE), Mongolian nomads were the primary trade suppliers of horses to neighbouring regions including China. The introduction of Mongolian horses, and with it the practice of horse riding, had a deep impact on Chinese culture, particularly within clothing styles, leading to the widespread adoption of trousers amongst men. Trousers, often paired with a caftan, another item of clothing illustrative of complex cultural interactions, were very popular among the lengths of the Silk Roads as they aided mobility and made horse riding over long distances more comfortable and practical. An interesting example of an early trouser find comes from a grave at Sampula in the Tarim Basin dating from the 1st century BCE. The trousers are made from wool and feature a design of a man holding a spear with a representation of a centaur above him. However, they are unique in that the scale of the design suggests they were in fact fashioned from a repurposed section of a large woollen wall-hanging from the 3rd – 2nd centuries BCE, possibly made in Bactria.\nWoven belts were another important item of clothing, considered prestigious possessions in a vast number of societies stretching from the Black Sea to the Mongolian steppe. A fragment of a woven silk belt with an inscription in Greek was uncovered at the Moshchevaya Balka burial complex in the North-Western Caucuses revealing close ties between the Turkic Bulgars in the Northern Caucasus and the Byzantine Empire (330 – 1453 CE). Similar inscribed belt fragments have also been found in nearby areas suggesting a number of such belts were gifted by the Byzantines to important local figures around the same time. Furthermore, another belt, this time a gold medallion belt, perfect illustrates the convergence of a myriad of different influences into one object of status and fashion. This 1st century CE belt comprised of gold medallions which was uncovered at Tillya Tepe archaeological site in the north of modern day Afghanistan. The belt is of a style reminiscent of Scytho-Siberian art however, the repeated gold medallions feature a female figure seated on a lion in the centre, an image which appears derived from Greco-Roman representations of the god Dionysus riding a panther. The figure is also wearing a tunic and pair of buskins (laced leather sandals) that resemble the hunting attire of the Greek goddess Artemis. However, the figure is probably a representation of the Iranian and Central Asian moon goddess Nana who also appears on Kushan coins of the 1st -3rd centuries CE, illustrative of the hybridity of many design motifs of the region.\nDress is an essential facet of social life, in addition to the practical applications of protecting from the elements etc. clothing and other adornments such as belts and jewellery, are cultural expressions of huge influence throughout the ancient and contemporary world. Clothing and fashion intersect with the arts, politics, and science, exerting considerable influence over wider culture. Through a complex network of mercantile exchange, a hybrid language of material culture was established whereby clothing, and transmitted and repurposed design motifs, served as a medium for discourse both between different societies along the Silk Roads and between the individual and society.","The Byzantine Empire or Eastern Roman Empire was the eastern section of the Roman Empire which remained in existence after the fall of the western section. The life of the empire is commonly considered to span AD 395 to 1453. During the thousand years of its existence, it was known simply as the \"Roman Empire.\" The Byzantines considered themselves to be Romans (Rhomaioi) and the legitimate continuation of the Roman Empire. Even though much of its, language, and culture was Greek, this posed no contradiction for the Romans of the Eastern Empire. Greek had been their language, and their culture had been Hellenistic for centuries. Latin remained the official language until the 7th century. Surrounding lands and empires (such as the Persians and Arabs to the east, Europeans to the west, and Russians to the north) called them Roman as well, and it was considered a great insult to refer to the empire as \"Greek.\", because \"Greek\" meant \"Pagan\". The empire was not referred to as \"Byzantine\" until the 17th century--and only then by \"Western\" historians, when they decided to distinguish the medieval entity from the (in reality quite different) ancient empire. This name comes from the ancient Greek colony of Byzantium.\n|330||Constantine I makes Constantinople (Nova Roma) his capital.|\n|527||Justinian I becomes Emperor.|\n|532-537||Justinian builds the church of Hagia Sophia (Αγια Σοφια/Holy Wisdom)|\n|1054||The Church in Rome breaks with the Church in Constantinople|\n|1204||Constantinople is occupied by crusaders|\n|1261||Constantinople is liberated by the Byzantine emperor Michael Palaeologus.|\n|1453||Ottoman Turks take Constantinople. End of Byzantine Empire|\n|Table of contents|\n3 Early History\n4 Hellenizing Era\n5 Golden Era\n6 End of Empire\nThe division of the Empire began with the Tetrarchy (quadrumvirate) in the late 3rd century AD with Emperor Diocletian, as an institution intended to more efficiently control the vast Roman empire. He split the empire in half, with two emperors ruling from Italy and Greece, each having a co-emperor of their own. This division continued into the 4th century until 324 when Constantine the Great managed to become the sole Emperor of the Empire. Constantine decided to found a new capital for himself and chose Byzantium (today's Istanbul) for that purpose. The rebuilding process was completed in AD 330. Constantine renamed the city Nova Roma (New Rome) but in popular use it was called Constantinople, meaning Constantine's City. This new capital became the centre of his administration. Constantine was also the first Christian emperor. Although the empire was not yet \"Byzantine\" under Constantine, Christianity would become one of the defining characteristics of the Byzantine Empire, as opposed to the pagan Roman Empire.\nAnother defining moment in the history of Roman/Byzantine Empire was the Battle of Adrianople in 378. This defeat, along with the death of Emperor Valens, is one possible date for dividing the ancient and medieval worlds. The Roman empire was divided further by Valens' successor Theodosius I (also called \"the great\"), who had ruled both beginning in 392. In 395 he gave the two halves to his two sons Arcadius and Honorius; Arcadius became ruler in the East, with his capital in Constantinople, and Honorius became ruler in the west, with his capital in Milan. At this point it is common to refer to the empire as \"Eastern Roman\" rather than \"Byzantine.\"\nThe general prevailing cultural identity of the Eastern Roman Empire was Hellenistic. Greek was not only the everyday language, but also the language of the church, of the literature and of all commercial transactions. The modern compulsion to constantly draw distinction between \"Latin West\" and \"Greek east\" and a need to repeatedly point out how the East was not \"really Roman\" because it wasn't Latin did not seem to be all that important to either Latin-speaking or Greek-speaking Romans. The empire was a multinational state, including Greeks, Vlachs, Armenians, Jews, Egyptians, Syrians, Illyrians, and Slavs, but its Greek culture radiated from large centers of Hellenism such as Constantinople, Antioch, Ephesus, Thessalonika and Alexandria. Though it was not as pronounced at this time, the Eastern Empire was developing its own style of Christianity, under such scholars as John Chrysostom.\nThe Eastern Empire was largely spared the difficulties of the west in the 3rd and 4th centuries, in part because urban culture was better established there and the initial invasions were attracted to the wealth of Rome. Throughout the 5th century various invasions conquered the western half of the empire, but at best could only demand tribute from the eastern half. Theodosius II expanded the walls of Constantinople, leaving the city impenetrable to \"barbarian\" attacks. Zeno I ruled the east as the empire in the west finally collapsed in 476. Zeno negotiated with the Goths, ending their threats to the east but leaving them in control of the west.\nThe 6th century saw the beginning of the conflicts with the Byzantine Empire's traditional early enemies, the Persians, Slavs, and Bulgars. Theological crises, such as the question of Monophysitism, also dominated the empire. However, the Eastern Empire had not forgotten its western roots. Under Justinian I, and the brilliant general Belisarius, the empire even regained some of the lost Roman provinces in the west, conquering much of Italy, north Africa, and Spain. Justinian updated the ancient Roman legal code in the new Corpus Juris Civilis, although it is notable that these laws were still written in Latin, a language which was becoming archaic and poorly understood even by those who wrote the new code. Under Justinian's reign, the Church of Hagia Sophia (Holy Wisdom) was constructed in the 530s. This church would become the centre of Byzantine religious life and the centre of the Eastern Orthodox form of Christianity.\nJustinian left his successors an empty treasury, however, and they were unable to deal with the sudden appearance of new invaders on all fronts. The Lombards seized Northern Italy, the Slavs overwhelmed much of the Balkans, and the Persians invaded and conqured the eastern provinces. These were recovered by the emperor Heraclius, but the unexpected appearance of the newly converted and united Muslim Arabs took Heraclius by surprise, and the southern provinces were all overrun. Mesopotamia, Syria and Egypt were permanently incorporated into the Muslim Empire in the 7th century.\nWhat the empire lost in territory, though, it made up in uniformity. Heraclius fully Hellenized the empire by making Greek the official language, and he took the title Basileus (\"king\") instead of the old Roman term Augustus. The empire was by now noticeably different in religion than the former imperial lands in western Europe, although the southern Byzantine provinces differed significantly from the north in culture and practiced monophysite (rather than Orthodox) Christianity. The loss of the southern provinces to the Arabs made Orthodoxy stronger in the remaining provinces. Heraclius divided the empire into a system of military provinces called themes to face permanent assault, with urban life declining outside the capital while Constantinople grew to become the largest city in the world. Attempts by the Arabs to conquer Constantinople failed in the face of the Byzantines' superior navy and their monopoly of the still mysterious incendiary weapon Greek fire. After repelling the initial Arab assault, the empire began to recover.\nThe 8th century was dominated by the controversy over iconoclasm. Icons were banned by Emperor Leo III, leading to revolts by iconophiles within the empire. Thanks to the efforts of Empress Irene, the Second Council of Nicaea met in 787 and affirmed that icons could be venerated but not worshipped. Irene also attempted a marriage alliance with Charlemagne, which would have united the two empires, but these plans came to nothing. The iconoclast controversy returned in the early 9th century, but they were restored once more in 843. These controversies did not help the disintegrating relations with the Roman Catholic Church and the Holy Roman Empire, which were both beginning to gain more power of their own.\nThe empire reached its height under the Macedonian emperors of the late 9th, 10th and early 11th centuries. During these years the Empire held out against pressure from the Roman church to remove Patriarch Photios, and gained control over the Adriatic Sea, parts of Italy, and much of the land held by the Bulgarians. The Bulgarians were completely defeated by Basil II in 1014. The Empire also gained a new ally (yet sometimes also an enemy) in the new Russian state in Kiev, from which the empire received an important mercenary force, the Varangian Guard.\nLike Rome before it, though, Byzantium soon fell into a period of difficulties, caused to a large extent by the growth of the landed aristocracy, which undermined the theme system. Facing its old enemies, the Holy Roman Empire and the Abbasid caliphate, it might have recovered, but around the same time new invaders appeared on the scene who had little reason to respect its reputation - the Normans, who conquered Italy, and the Seljuk Turks, who were mainly interested in defeating Egypt but still made moves into Asia Minor, the main recruiting ground for the Byzantine armies. With the defeat at Manzikert of emperor Romanus IV in 1071 by Alp Arslan, sultan of the Seljuk Turks, most of that province was lost. The final split between the Roman and Orthodox churches occurred at this time as well, with their mutual excommunication in 1054.\nEnd of Empire\nThe last few centuries of Byzantine life were brought by a usurper, Alexius Comnenus, who began to reestablish an army on the basis of feudal grants (pronoia) and made significant advances against the Seljuk Turks. His plea for western aid against the Seljuk advance brought about the First Crusade, which helped him reclaim Nicaea but soon distanced itself from imperial aid. Later crusades grew increasingly antagonistic. Although Alexius' grandson Manuel I Comnenus was a friend of the Crusaders, neither side could forget that the other had excommunicated them, and the Byzantines were very suspicious of the intentions of the Roman Catholic Crusaders who continually passed through their territory. The Germans of the Holy Roman Empire and the Normans of Sicily and Italy continued to attack the empire in the 11th and 12th centuries. The Italian city states, who had been granted trading rights in Constantinople by Alexius, became the targets of anti-Western sentiments as the most visibly example of Western \"Franks\" or \"Latins.\" The Venetians were especially disliked, even though their ships were the basis of the Byzantine navy. To add to the empire's concerns, the Seljuks remained a threat, defeating Manuel at Myriokephalon in 1176.\nFrederick Barbarossa attempted to conquer the empire during the Third Crusade, but it was the Fourth Crusade that had the most devastating effect on the empire. Although the intent of the crusade was to conquer Egypt, the Venetians took control of the expedition, and under their influence the crusade captured Constantinople in 1204. As a result a short-lived feudal kingdom was founded, (the Latin Empire) and Byzantine power was permanently weakened.\nThree Byzantine successor states were left - the Empire of Nicaea, Epirus, and Trebizond. The first, controlled by the Palaeologan dynasty, managed to reclaim Constantinople in 1261 and defeat Epirus, reviving the empire but giving too much attention to Europe when the Asian provinces were the primary concern. For a while the empire survived simply because the Muslims were too divided to attack, but eventually the Ottomans overran all but a handful of port cities. The empire appealed to the west for help, but they would only consider sending aid in return for reuniting the churches. Church unity was considered, and occasionally accomplished by law, but the Orthodox citizens would not accept Roman Catholicism. Some western mercenaries arrived to help, but many preferred to let the empire die, and did nothing as the Ottomans picked apart of the remaining territories.\nConstantinople was initially not considered worth the effort of conquest, but with the advent of cannons, the walls, which had been impenetrable except by the Crusaders for over 1000 years, no longer offered protection from the Ottomans. The Fall of Constantinople finally came after a two-year siege by Mehmed II on May 29, 1453. By the end of the century the remaining cities, such as Trebizond and Mistra, had also fallen.\nThe Byzantine empire played an important role in the transmission of classical knowledge to the Islamic world. Its most lasting influence, though, lies in its church. Early Byzantine missionary work spread Orthodox Christianity to various Slavic peoples, and it is still predominant among them and the Greeks. The start and end dates of the capital's independence, 395 to 1453, were originally the defined bounds of the Middle Ages.\nSee also List of Byzantine Empire-related topics, Roman Empire, Roman Emperors, Byzantine Emperors, Latin Empire, Empire of Nicaea, Byzantine currency, Byzantine architecture and Byzantine aristocracy and bureaucracy."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6759858d-d320-42d5-96e2-26745d223b94>","<urn:uuid:787fdd11-c05d-4bab-81b1-1ce6f6e2e603>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I want to make DIY hair products with water. Please list the different types of water I can use, ranked from best to worst.","answer":"Here are the 4 types of water ranked from best to worst for DIY hair products: 1. Distilled water - the best option, in its purest form, created through steam distillation 2. Filtered water - acceptable if using a high-quality filtration system 3. Boiled water - acceptable for home use but not recommended 4. Tap water - should never be used due to high bacteria content and undesirable minerals","context":["I love DIY and all that can be done with it. Using organic ingredients in their rawest form and combining them in different ways to become something new without adding unnecessary harmful ingredients can be a fun and fruitful hobby. As the popularity of DIY hair product grows I find it is of the highest importance that people know how to create products at home in the most sanitary ways possible.\nHow do I keep my DIY sanitary?\n- Always wash your hands, wear protective gear, gloves, hair net, shoes and eye protection. Nothing should be exposed. This reduces the likelihood that your products will be compromised or contaminated. Be sure to protect yourself by always wear closed toe shoes and minimize exposed skin.\n- Sanitize you work area, utensils, measuring items, tools, bowls, etc... Be sure everything is sanitized.\n- Never cross contaminate. Any tools, pots and other items used should only be for creating your products. Do not use anything for food and beauty products. No bueno.\nWhat containers should I use?\n- (Best Option) Glass: Will always be your best choice. It does not absorb ingredients or hold odors after being properly cleansed.\n- Plastic containers should be safe for the intended use.\n- (Worst Option) Metals: When metals are used it is best to use a high quality steel (stainless preferably). Some metals react negatively with oils, such as essential oils, this is not an ideal option for many things.\nCan I use wooden & plastic utensils?\nMany people cook with wooden items and feel it should be alright to use them for your products. However, wood absorbs liquid, oils, fragrances and other things. Using wooden utensils and bowls is not an option. They are too porous and that makes it very hard to clean properly. Plastic and rubber on the other hand are composed of chemicals, eliminating them as an option for most.\nIt is best to use silicone or stainless steel rather than wood or plastic.\nCan I re-use containers that I already have?\nWe know that many reuse/ re-purpose bottles, jars and other containers. If this is something that you do always:\n- Be sure that the item is heat safe and not highly porous. Porous materials increase the opportunity for bacteria growth. Always be sure to wash the container with hot water and soap. This removes any residue that may be in the container.\n- Boil them fully submerged in a pot of water, for approximately 10-15 minutes. Be sure to use heat resistant tongs or utensils to remove them from the pot. Be very cautious when removing the containers from the water. They will be really hot!\n- Be sure everything is 100% dry before using it!\n- If you need to use them right away just preheat your oven to 280 degrees Fahrenheit. Place the glass containers in the oven for approximately 10 minutes or until they are 100% dry. Let them cool completely and they are ready to be used.\n- Be sure to cleanse utensils with a cleanser that is not toxic.\nIs it ok to use tap water?\nWater is essential to life, we thrive on it - and so do microbes and other nasty bacteria. Ensuring the proper precautions lessens the possibility for having any potential heath issues. You are making preservative free DIY products with water. This is a haven for bacterial growth! This is why I prefer to use commercial grade preservatives. If water is added to any aspect of your product it is imperative to properly preserve the item or use it in a very short amount of time. Water is the #1 ingredient for moisture. It is wonderful for the hair and skin. The type of water used is also very important.\n4 common types of water\n- Distilled water (best): Is water in its simplest and purist form. It is created by distillation of water. The water is steamed. The steam is captured and the contaminants are discarded.\n- Filtered water: High quality water filtration system can be sued as well but the more economical route for the at home diy-er is to just purchase distilled water.\n- Boiled water: Is alright for home use products but I still don't recommend it.\n- Tap water (worst): Should never be used. It usually contains a great deal of bacteria and undesirable minerals.\nCan I add essential oils?\nYes, but only in small amounts. Essential oils are high concentrations of very potent oils that are undiluted, unless otherwise stated, when bought. They must be diluted into a carrier oil prior to use. The most products only contain a maximum of 2% essential oil in products that are made for the skin. Two percent is generally the highest amount that is safe to be used. Only use skin-safe essential oils on your skin and never consume oils that do not state that they are made for consumption.\nWhat is the shelf life of a DIY product?\nBecause you are not adding preservatives to your products, and because bacteria can grow quickly, it is best to only make a single-use batch of your DIY product. It is best not to make more than what is needed for a very short period of time.\nTo prolong the shelf life of your product make sure you:\n- Always use clean hands when getting products out of your containers. Using a spoon is more ideal so that you are not adding any bacteria into the product with your skin.\n- Close containers after each use.\n- Refrigerate any product that has water as an ingredient.\n- Test pH (with pH strips if needed).\nDo you practice safe DIY practices?"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:295bd760-23f9-424b-8e7f-22d132cb255c>"],"error":null}

{"question":"What medicinal properties does silver birch have and how is it traditionally used for treating various health conditions? Please provide specific applications and compounds.","answer":"Silver birch is used in traditional medicine as a diuretic and for treating multiple conditions including high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, gout, kidney stones, nephritis, cystitis, digestive disturbances and respiratory diseases. It's typically administered as a decoction of the bark or leaves. Externally, it's used to promote healing and treat skin conditions like eczema and psoriasis. The bark contains up to 20% betulin and other triterpenes that have proven anti-inflammatory, antiviral and anti-cancer properties. The buds contain an essential oil with α-copaene, germacrene D and δ-cadinene as main components.","context":["|Silver birch forest, Inari, Finland|\nBetula pendula, commonly known as silver birch or warty birch, is a species of tree in the family Betulaceae, native to Europe and parts of Asia, though in southern Europe it is only found at higher altitudes. Its range extends into Siberia, China and southwest Asia in the mountains of northern Turkey, the Caucasus and northern Iran. It has been introduced into North America, where it is known as the European white birch, and is considered invasive in some states in USA and in parts of Canada.\nThe silver birch is a medium-sized deciduous tree that owes its common name to the white peeling bark on the trunk. The twigs are slender and often pendulous and the leaves are roughly triangular with doubly serrate margins and turn yellow in autumn before they fall. The flowers are catkins and the light, winged seed get widely scattered by the wind. The silver birch is a hardy tree, a pioneer species, and one of the first trees to appear on bare or fire-swept land. Many species of birds and animals are found in birch woodland, the tree supports a wide range of insects and the light shade it casts allows shrubby and other plants to grow beneath its canopy. It is planted decoratively in parks and gardens and is used for forest products such as joinery timber, firewood, tanning, racecourse jumps and brooms. Various parts of the tree are used in traditional medicine and the bark contains triterpenes which have been shown to have medicinal properties.\nThe silver birch is a medium-sized deciduous tree, typically reaching 15 to 25 m (49 to 82 ft) tall (exceptionally up to 31 metres (102 ft)), with a slender trunk usually under 40 cm (16 in) diameter. The bark on the trunk and branches is golden-brown at first, but later this turns to white as a result of papery tissue developing on the surface and peeling off in flakes. The bark remains smooth until the tree gets quite large, but in older trees, the bark thickens, becoming irregular, dark and rugged. Young branches have whitish resin warts and the twigs are slender, hairless and often pendulous. The buds are small and sticky, and development is sympodial, that is to say the terminal bud dies away and growth continues from a lateral bud. Some shoots are long and bear the male catkins at the tip, while others are short and bear female catkins. The immature male catkins are present during the winter but the female catkins develop in the spring, soon after the leaves unfurl.\nThe leaves have short slender stalks and are 3 to 7 cm (1.2 to 2.8 in) long, triangular with broad, untoothed, wedge-shaped bases, slender pointed tips and coarsely double-toothed, serrated margins. They are sticky with resin at first but this dries as they age leaving small white scales. The foliage is a pale to medium green and turns yellow early in the autumn before the leaves fall. In mid-summer, the female catkins mature and the male catkins expand and release pollen, and wind pollination takes place. The small 1 to 2 mm winged seeds ripen in late summer on pendulous, cylindrical catkins 2 to 4 cm (0.8 to 1.6 in) long and 7 mm (0.3 in) broad. The seeds are very numerous and are separated by scales, and when ripe, the whole catkin disintegrates and the seeds are spread widely by the wind.\nDistribution and habitat\nThe silver birch grows naturally from western Europe eastwards to Kazakhstan, the Sakha Republic in Siberia, Mongolia and the Xinjiang province in China, and southwards to the mountains of the Caucasus and northern Iran, Iraq and Turkey. It is also native to northern Morocco and has become naturalised in some other parts of the world. In the southern parts of its range it is mainly found in mountainous regions. Its light seeds are easily blown by the wind and it is a pioneer species, one of the first trees to sprout on bare land or after a forest fire. It needs plenty of light and does best on dry, acid soils and is found on heathland, mountainsides and clinging to crags. Its tolerance to pollution make it suitable for planting in industrial areas and exposed sites. It has been introduced into North America where it is known as the European white birch, and is considered invasive in the states of Kentucky, Maryland, Washington and Wisconsin. It is naturalised and locally invasive in parts of Canada.\nThe closely related Betula platyphylla in northern Asia and Betula szechuanica of central Asia are also treated as varieties of silver birch by some botanists, as B. pendula var. platyphylla and B. pendula var. szechuanica respectively (see birch classification).\nB. pendula is distinguished from the related downy birch (B. pubescens, the other common European birch) in having hairless, warty shoots (hairy and without warts in downy birch), more triangular leaves with double serration on the margins (more ovoid and with single serrations in downy birch), and whiter bark often with scattered black fissures (greyer, less fissured, in downy birch). It is also distinguished cytologically, silver birch being diploid (with two sets of chromosomes), whereas downy birch is tetraploid (four sets of chromosomes). Hybrids between the two are known, but are very rare, and being triploid, are sterile. The two have differences in habitat requirements, with silver birch found mainly on dry, sandy soils, and downy birch more common on wet, poorly drained sites such as clay soils and peat bogs. Silver birch also demands slightly more summer warmth than does downy birch, which is significant in the cooler parts of Europe. Many North American texts treat the two species as conspecific (and cause confusion by combining the downy birch's alternative vernacular name 'white birch', with the scientific name B. pendula of the other species), but they are regarded as distinct species throughout Europe.\nSynonyms include Betula pendula var. carelica (Merckl.) Hämet-Ahti, B. pendula var. laciniata (Wahlenb.) Tidestr., B. pendula var. lapponica (Lindq.) Hämet-Ahti, B. aetnensis Raf., B. montana V.N.Vassil, B. talassica Poljakov, B. verrucosa Ehrh., B. verrucosa var. lapponica Lindq., and B. fontqueri Rothm. The rejected name Betula alba L. also applied in part to B. pendula, though also to B. pubescens.\nThe silver birch has an open canopy which allows plenty of light to reach the ground. This allows a variety of mosses, grasses and flowering plants to grow beneath which in turn attract insects. Flowering plants often found in birch woods include primrose (Primula vulgaris), violet (Viola riviniana), bluebell (Hyacinthoides non-scripta), wood anemone (Anemone nemorosa) and wood sorrel (Oxalis acetosella). Small shrubs that grow on the forest floor include blaeberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and cowberry (Vaccinium vitis-idaea). Birds found in birch woodland include the chaffinch, tree pipit, willow warbler, nightingale, robin, woodcock, redpoll and green woodpecker.\nThe branches of the silver birch often have tangled masses of twigs known as witch's brooms growing among them, caused by the fungus Taphrina betulina. Old trees are often killed by the decay fungus Piptoporus betulinus and fallen branches rot rapidly on the forest floor. This tree commonly grows with the mycorrhizal fungus Amanita muscaria in a mutualistic relationship. This applies particularly to acidic or nutrient-poor soils. Other mycorrhizal associates include Leccinum scabrum and Cantharellus cibarius. It has been shown that, as well as mycorrhiza, the presence of microfauna in the soil assists the growth of the tree, as it enhances the mobilization of nutrients.\nThe larvae of a large number of species of butterflies, moths and other insects feed on the leaves and other parts of the silver birch. In Germany, almost 500 species of insect have been found on silver and downy birch including 106 beetles and 105 lepidopterans, with 133 insect species feeding almost exclusively on birch. In the United States, the wood is attacked by the bronze birch borer (Agrilus anxius), an insect pest to which it has no natural resistance.\nSilver birch is often planted in parks and gardens, grown for its white bark and gracefully drooping shoots, sometimes even in warmer-than-optimum places such as Los Angeles and Sydney. In Scandinavia and other regions of northern Europe, it is grown for forest products such as lumber and pulp, as well as for aesthetic purposes and ecosystem services. It is sometimes used as a pioneer and nurse tree elsewhere.\nSilver birch wood is pale in colour with no distinct heartwood and is used in making furniture, plywood, veneers, parquet blocks, skis, kitchen utensils and in turnery. It makes a good firewood that produces a good heat when burnt but is quickly consumed by the flames. Slabs of bark are used for making roof shingles and wooden footwear. Historically, the bark was used for tanning. Bark can be heated and the resin collected; the resin is an excellent waterproof glue and useful for starting fires. The thin sheets of bark that peel off young wood contain a waxy resin and are easy to ignite even when wet. The dead twigs are also useful as kindling for outdoor fires.\nBirch brushwood is used for racecourse jumps and besom brooms. In the spring, large quantities of sap rise up the trunk and this can be tapped. It contains around 1% sugars and can be used in a similar way to maple syrup, being drunk fresh, concentrated by evaporation or fermented into a \"wine\". In Sweden, the bark of birch trees was ground up and used to make bark bread, a form of famine food. The removal of bark was at one time so widespread that Carl Linnaeus expressed his concern for the survival of the woodlands.\nSilver birch is used in traditional medicine as a diuretic and is reputed to be useful in the treatment of high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, gout, kidney stones, nephritis, cystitis, digestive disturbances and respiratory diseases. For these purposes, a decoction of the bark or leaves is generally used. Externally silver birch is used to promote healing, relieve pain and treat inflammations and infections of the skin such as eczema and psoriasis.\nThe outer part of the bark contains up to 20% betulin. The main components in the essential oil of the buds are α-copaene (~10%), germacrene D (~15%) and δ-cadinene (~13%). Also present in the bark are other triterpene substances which have been shown to have anti-inflammatory, antiviral and anti-cancer properties.\nSuccessful birch cultivation requires a climate cool enough for at least the occasional winter snowfall. As they are shallow-rooted, they may require water during dry periods. They grow best in full sun planted in deep, well-drained soil.\n- 'Carelica' is called \"curly birch\" in Finland; the wood is hard and decorative and is used in wood-carving.\n- 'Laciniata' agm (commonly misidentified as 'Darlecarlica') has deeply incised leaves and weeping branches.\n- 'Purpurea' has dark purple leaves.\n- 'Tristis' agm has an erect trunk with weeping branchlets.\n- 'Youngii' has dense, twiggy weeping growth with no central leader and requires being grafted onto a standard stem of normal silver birch.\n|Wikimedia Commons has media related to Betula pendula.|\n|Wikispecies has information related to: Betula pendula|\n- Vedel, Helge; Lange, Johan (1960).

{"question":"Size comparison: How large is Cabo Pulmo National Marine Park versus Kaziranga National Park?","answer":"Cabo Pulmo National Marine Park covers 7,111 hectares of water, while Kaziranga National Park is significantly larger at 42,996 hectares, with a total tiger reserve area of 1,030 square kilometers including a core area of 430 square kilometers.","context":["In the last 40 years, Cabo San Lucas, located at the tip of Baja Sur just 20 miles south of the Eastcape, has seen a dramatic building boom. The coast between Cabo San Lucas and San Jose went from 6 hotels in 1974 to 30 hotels in 2000. Today it is a massive stretch of 20 miles of large luxury hotels and the population of Cabo San Lucas grew from under 12,000 in 1974 to over 160,000 in 2005.\n“Cabo San Lucas in 1966”\n“Cabo San Lucas in 2016”\nThe 17- mile corridor between Cabo San Lucas is now an almost unbroken, highly concentrated chain of large beachside hotels.\nTourist Corridor Map\nWith beach area between Cabo San Lucas and San Jose becoming scarce, it is not surprising that FONATUR, the Mexican governmental agency charged with bringing more tourism to Mexico, considers the sandy beaches and clear waters surrounding the Sea of Cortez as a prime location for new tourist centers.\nThe number of proposals for tourist developments on the Eastcape (defined by BCI as north of San Jose to south of La Paz) has increased in recent years.\nWhy It Matters\nIt is very likely that tourism development will expand to the Eastcape (and around the Gulf of California). Policy makers, developers, business owners, citizens, tourists, and children all play a role in defining the kind of tourist development that will best serve the region.\nThis coast is home to one of the few rocky reefs with coral this far north. That reef provides food and protection to many of the 800 species of marine animals found in the Gulf of California. The reef is the central feature of the Cabo Pulmo National Marine Park, 7,111 square hectares of water with highly regulated fishing. (Cabo Pulmo National Marine Park Copyright: CP National Park)\nThe Park has also brought small businesses and jobs to the region to support scuba divers and snorklers, who come to enjoy the sealife.\nThe fishing regulation and the stewardship of the Cabo Pulmo community, have had great results. In a period of 10 years the biomass of the reef region increased by over 460%. Reefs that were almost barren of fish because of overfishing are now teeming with schools of jacks and other species. Sharks and giant grouper, essential parts of the food chain, have returned to the area. The health of the sea-life around the reefs provides greater availability of large fertile fish to the waters surrounding the park as well.\nCitation: Aburto-Oropeza O, Erisman B, Galland GR, Mascareñas-Osorio I, Sala E, Ezcurra E (2011) Large Recovery of Fish Biomass in a No-Take Marine Reserve.

Large construction projects may include movement of the sandy bottom of the sea, as was the case in La Ribera; sediment in the water from marina construction and sediment from dust-filled run-off from the construction site. Large hotels, golf courses, and tracts of homes produce human waste, garbage, and fertilizer pollution that can destroy water quality and have the potential of killing the reef.\nSealife is not the only endangered natural resource. Fresh water is scarce in this region. The aquifers provide water for the towns, farms, and ranches. Accurate assessments of water availability and the capacity available is essential to planning. The desert landscape is filled with plants and animals with habitats on the shoreline. Recent studies uncovered lagoon habitats that are home to species of plants found nowhere else in the world. Plantlife protects the region from erosion caused by storms and helps capture water to fill aquifers.\nOther areas north and south of Cabo Pulmo face the same threats. There are sea lion colonies, humpback whale migration routes, shark nurseries, and turtle nesting sites, aquifers and rivers all along this coast. All can be damaged by construction that is not well-planned.\nWHAT BCI IS DOING\nBCI will contract with leading researchers to produce white papers on issues that are critical to the future of the Eastcape coast. A white paper will summarize the scientific research on topics such as –\n• The source and quantity of water on the Eastcape\n• The economic value of the ecosystem services such as fishing, tourism, coastal protection\n• Cabo Pulmo as a “case study” for a successful marine protected area\n• Definition of sustainable development on the Eastcape\n• New models for sustainable tourism that maximizes quality jobs and revenue for Mexico\nSimilar to the Pew white papers, these summaries will serve as reference materials for government officials, non-profits, business developers, researchers, and students. Pew papers have impacted international policy and motivated international meetings. BCI’s Eastcape papers will serve the same purpose of summarizing research on key issues and providing motivation for policy meetings for the Eastcape of Baja Sur.\n• BCI white papers will serve as a basic reference source to decision makers and influencers as they consider use of the coastline of the Eastcape.\n• Research on key issues will cite existing research making the information easily accessible.\n• Meetings of experts and stakeholders will provide the opportunity to raise issues and solve problems in a timely way\nThe first Whitepaper will be completed within a year of funding.\nA stakeholder meeting will be convened on the topic of the Whitepaper shortly after publication.","08 July, 2020\n3 Min Read\nAccording to Kaziranga National Park authorities around 80% of its area has been inundated due to floods.

{"question":"What is the key difference between testing knife sharpness using hair shaving versus an electric sharpener?","answer":"Testing knife sharpness by shaving hair on arms or fingers is quick and efficient but dangerous for novices, while electric sharpeners provide a safer alternative. Electric sharpeners are particularly useful in professional settings requiring frequent sharpening of many knives, though they have the limitation of requiring constant electricity and cannot be used in places without power supply.","context":["Being ready could be the keystone to any successful hunting journey. This means getting the right gear ready as it’s needed. It indicates having that equipment in working order for jobs available. You are able to own the highest priced looking blade in the marketplace however, if it is not correctly sharpened, it’s going to be useless. Knife sharpening is one of the most commonly over looked facets of searching trip readiness. With only some fundamental sharpening knowledge and a couple of easy tools, but any hunter know having their knife ready.\nTesting Your Blade\nA number of easy tests occur to check the sharpness of the hunting knife. Some outdoorsmen try a knife’s sharpness by shaving a tiny spot of locks on their arms or fingers. This test is fast and efficient but, let’s be honest, some dangerous for a novice. For all those not confident that they can inform their knife is lifeless, you will find blade side testing kits offered by through outdoor equipment retailers. These kits may be expensive.\nSkilled hunters can frequently tell if a blade is dull by simply considering it. To aesthetically look for dullness, keep the blade using advantage in line with a very good source of light and go it forward and backward a bit. If you see a reflection or glint then chances are you have actually a dull blade. If all else fails, walk into your outdoor items store and inquire a specialist to assist you examine knife sharpness.\nThe Right Tools\nonce you’ve concluded that your knife needs sharpening, you need to get hold of just the right sharpening equipment. Sharpening stones are effective, widely used, and can be bought in multiple types and sizes. When purchasing a stone, try to find one created from compounds with a relative hardness of 9 or higher. Stones produced from fused aluminum oxide or silicon carbide work nicely, as does silicon carbide sandpaper glued to a wooden block or something similar.\nA sharpening guide is a clamp-like tool that attaches towards the blade of the knife and helps with managing the angle of this knife. This can be ideal for notice blade sharpeners since they’re the only way to guarantee an exact sharpening direction. More advanced hunters could find all of them unneeded.\nSharpening The Blade\nThere’s two basic steps to correctly sharpening a blade. The very first is to build up a burr, or, a rough, ragged edge on the surface of this blade. As soon as which developed, the blade then has to be polished until the side is smooth.\nTo build up a burr, initially set the perspective of the blade properly after which grind one part and soon you have removed the old edge. Continue grinding before you feels the burr along with your flash; it will feel jagged and serrated. Once you’ve a pleasant burr on a single part, flip the knife more than and boost a burr on the other side. Take into account that some knives (ceramic and extremely tough steel mostly) will likely not raise a burr. If you have tried increasing a burr on the knife without any success, you may have one of these sorts. Consult a professional for all about sharpening these blades.\nOnce you have raised a burr in your knife take care to place some finishing variations on the blade by polishing the blade. You will find three basic polishing shots you need to use in order to complete the sharpening procedure – on-stroke, off-stroke, or circular strokes. The off-stroke could be the simplest technique for newbies. Commence to work away the burr created by the initial stone you used. The burr should gradually commence to fade. Once it really is practically invisible, switch to the circular swing and finish milling from the old scratch pattern. Wind up simply by using light strokes to get rid of the rest of the burr. At this stage your blade should always be exceptionally sharp, without burr and just micro-serrations.\nYou shouldn’t be afraid to inquire of experts for assistance. Woodworkers and butchers are often more qualified in art of sharpening than blade manufacturers or collectors. Ask one in your area should they can help you or offer some easy techniques.\nIt is important for all your hunting resources to stay prime condition before going on a holiday, plus blade is not any exclusion. By using these resources and correct strategies you are able to efficiently sharpen your knife before or during your journey while not having to concern yourself with the problems a dull blade trigger.","It is hard to imagine a kitchen without a knife. With a knife, we clean, slice, cut, flip, scrape, carve, etc. If the knife is sharp, then the work goes faster. With a sharp knife you can slice bread, without crumpling and crushing it, with a sharp knife you can cut soft tomatoes without crushing them, with a sharp knife everything will be sliced neater and faster.\nElectric Knife Sharpener\nElectric sharpener is a device for sharpening knives, which runs from the power supply. In a professional environment that requires a frequent sharpening of a large number of knives, sharpeners have a great popularity. For home use, such sharpeners are purchased less often.\nBy cons of electric sharpeners a constant demand for electricity can be mentioned. You cannot sharpen a knife with the help of it in nature or at the summer cottage, which is not supplied with electricity. The advantages include low weight and small volume.\nElectric sharpeners are divided into professional ones and ones for household use, the latter variant is preferable for home use. These sharpeners are powered by voltage of 220V. They are equipped with a switch mode, so you can sharpen a dull knife or simply erode (polish) a sharp one. Polishing is carried out for knifes with sharp blades to keep them in working conditions. If you make regular polishing, you can avoid the extra sharpening of the knives.\nHand-held sharpeners are very popular among housewives because you can sharpen your knife by this device quickly, and most importantly – on your own. Such a tool is very simple to use and requires no additional configuration. It can be used at any time and any condition, it is lightweight, does not require a lot of storage space, and its price will please you.\nIf you use several knives and you are not a professional chef, we advise you to choose the manual sharpener. If your work is directly related to cooking, you use a large number of knives and sharpening takes a lot of time, it is better to buy an electric sharpener.\nDiamond is the hardest material used as an abrasive for knives sharpening. If the machine is coated with diamond grit, the speed of sharpening a knife is increased by a factor of several times, but it does not provide a flatness and smoothness of sharpened material. Besides grinding with a diamond coating are expensive.\nCeramics also has enough toughness to be material for the abrasive. Ceramic abrasive sharpeners are cheaper than the diamond ones, and at work, they provide a smooth surface. Unfortunately, the speed of the sharpening is much lower, so the stones with ceramic abrasive more often are used for finishing the metal to perfection.\nNatural stones as an abrasive agent were used even by primitive people.\nThe best known are microcrystalline quartz and silicon crystals, which are interconnected with clay.\nOne of the disadvantage of such abrasives is uneven sharpening.\nWusthof is a manufacturer of cutlery with an extraordinary history. For nearly 200 years, Wusthof has earned an excellent reputation for excellence in design and quality. Given that Wusthof specializes exclusively in the production of knives, scissors and accessories for them, so the knife assortment is very diverse and includes both classic European models of knives and traditional Japanese chef knives. Each knife has a special design of the blade, which is determined by its specialization – for cleaning and cutting vegetables, meat cutting, slicing bread, fish-knives and others. Depending on the design of materials and general purpose – professional, chef or for household use, Wusthof knives are divided into several well-known collections.\nWusthof Xline is the latest and premium collection of knives by Wusthof. Dynamic lines intersect at the X point, the point of the perfect balance of the blade. Xline knife has a real man’s character and designed for strong and successful people. At the collection there are 8 knives for classic european cuisine. Knives are sold as individually both as gift sets and cutlery boxes.\nWusthof Classic is the case when the name of the collection speaks for itself. These classic forged German knives are made of special high-carbon stainless steel. They offer their owner handles of traditional form with seamless synthetic overlays, exceptional quality sharpening, the use of knives both at the professional kitchen, and at home. The collection has more than 40 models of blades for any type of culinary activities. Knives are sold individually and as sets, cutlery boxes, and special portable kits for chefs.\nWusthof Culinar is a series of knives that are completely made of the best stainless steel. Sophisticated timeless design is provided by steel satin handles in the shape of sea shells. The handle is decorated with a brand trident. Exceptional sharpness of the high carbon steel blades and the highest level of hygiene deserve accolades only professional chefs.\nThe collection includes more than 20 models of blades for any type of culinary activities. Knives are sold as individually, and as gift sets and cutlery boxes.\nWusthof Gourmet is an extensive collection of knives for different purposes that offers an excellent German quality at an affordable price. Gourmet knives are made in the classic form of a single piece of high-carbon steel and sharpened by laser technology for maximum sharpness, handles are protected with plates of black polypropylene, modern and environmentally friendly material and secured with three rivets.\nWusthof Silverpoint is the most affordable collection of knives by Wusthof. Laconic design and impeccable quality of Silverpoint knives make them desirable assistants for any kitchen. Strong and sharp blade of the best German steel combined with ergonomic and safe plastic handle provides a solution to any culinary tasks. The collection of more than 20 models of knives for cooking any kind of activity as traditional European model range, as well as for Asian culinary school.\nThere are only two kinds of ceramic knives: made from white or black ceramic. That said a blade produced from black ceramic material is notable for high strength and wear resistance. It is clear that its price will be higher than its competitors, but made of white ceramic.\nCons of ceramic knives:\nThe main drawback of the material from which they are made, which is zirconium oxide as odd as it may seem is the reverse side of all the advantages of this material. The harder and more reliable is the material that accordingly it is less flexible.\nNext negative point is connected with hardness of zirconium oxide too. You will not be able to sharpen the blade with your usual whetstone.\nEarlier, at the beginnings of sales, ceramic sharpening has not been recommended at home. Now, when technologies moved forward, there are special diamond-coated sharpeners, which can be purchased in the store and you can sharpen the knife at home by yourself.\nCeramic knives are not very convenient to use when you decide to cut pretty large products.\nCeramic knives are not meant to chop any kind of bones, to crack nuts, or cut hard, frozen food that you have just removed from the freezer or refrigerator.\nAs the material from which they are made is very hard, these procedures may damage your knife. What they can cut without fear, that is any fruits, vegetables, bread, fresh (and not frozen) meat or fish, different kinds of cheese and sausages. Also it is not necessary to cut with the ceramic knife on a glass cutting board and storing it with other blades is also not recommended.\nPros of ceramic knives:\nCeramic material of the blade will never change the taste, smell or appearance of the food. What does it mean? The hardness of the blade is such that it is completely impermeable to oils, acids, juices (some of which are quite aggressive), salt, and any other ingredients that we deal with in cooking.\nCeramic blades are much sharper than usual ones. Zirconium oxide, again because of its hardness and fine crystalline structure allows the blade to sharpen the blade to the scape of microscopic precision.\nIf you strictly follow the rules of operation, such blades will serve you for several years without raking and scratches on their blades.\nCeramic knives are rustless, because these blades will never rust and will not change its natural state.\nThe blades of ceramic are twice as lighter than similar products made of other materials. This knife does not load your hand at work, which makes it possible to use it for a sufficiently large amount of time and work in the kitchen.\nComfortable and ergonomic handles are able to provide precise control over your movements. Blade perfectly fits the hand, and using it just a pleasure.\nAlso it is a sufficient ease of maintenance. The surface is smooth and perfectly polished, which does not allow bacteria to reproduce themselves.\nThe choice of decent “tools of kitchen production” is an indicator of the professionalism and experience of its direct owner, and the status of the restaurant.\nThe blade is a key element of the knife. Key indicators are endurance, strength, flexibility, hardness, durability, resistance to abrasion, the ability to keep rake. The thickness and shape of the blade directly depend on which type of work and what kitchen style knife is designed for. As for the blade, in turn, there are three major components – the edge, butt, cutting edge. That is the knife point and the type of sharpening that made the knife suitable for particular works. Utility (chef) blade has a central tip (exactly halfway between the edge and the butt). The more rounded is the blade, and the edge is snub-up, the more it allows the cook to make an effort at some point – for example, the separation of hard strings (for cutting meat with bones or frozen one it is wiser not to use a knife, but a special cleaver- even the most durable cook tool will not endure such mockery for a long time). Rounded blade is a great assistant for a cook, who is cutting products, with continuous motions up and down.\nThe cutting edge is responsible for sharpness. The most common, smooth edges is a universal weapon that allows you to clean, cut, chop. Its opposite – serrated blade – clearly distinguishes by work specializations. Firstly, there exists a wide serrater with wavy indentations – hollow ground, laid along the entire length on usually stretched long blade.\nHigh-quality chef’s knife cannot be made by stamping of sheet steel, otherwise it simply will not sustain heavy load. Only forged steel – a result of forging steel by sealing that blade gets the highest strength characteristics.\nFor chefs knives the steel of the following types is used: pure chrome stainless (adding chromium makes the steel harder), and chromium, molybdenum and vanadium alloy (molybdenum gives the steel a special hardness and vanadium reduces the brittleness). Knives of the second type are more expensive, because their production process is more costly and lengthy.\nTraditionally knife handles were made of solid wood – comfortable, stylish, and the hand does not slip. Today, the majority of professional knife handles are made of durable polymer: plastic copes better with aggressive environment, it does not give shelter to microorganisms and provides tighter adjusting of covering to the metal plate parts.\nThe most important indicator of the knife quality is its appearance. All parts of the high-quality knife – blade, neck, handle – must be perfect, without gaps, adjusted to each other. Equally important is the perfect polishing of the blade, which should be looked through at the light. And, as follows from above the material from which the blade is made matters.\nThe minimum set for European kitchen – “chef’s trio”, which includes a large chef’s knife length of 45-48 cm, a medium one – of 40-37 cm and 27-30 cm small one. In principle, such an arsenal will cope with all basic cooking operations. Often manufacturers offer ready set of 7-9 knives. But most professionals prefer to collect their “ammunition” on their own, to choose the working tool according to their taste and hand.\nChoosing and buying a modern flatware is now quite easy – shops offer incredible diversity.\nMost often, at the stores you can find knives, spoons and forks made of stainless steel, nickel or silver. More often – they are made of silver, and aluminum, wood and plastic.\nFor the production of cutlery stainless steel fits just perfect – it is inexpensive, durable, absolute inertia.\nCupronickel or nickel-silver are elite materials, so their cost is high. Nowadays almost no one produces cutlery made of cupronickel, and nickel-silver ones almost always have outer coating of silver, gold, etc., that is, the purchase of such sets of forks, knives and spoons is also an investment;\nIt is necessary to mention also about the cutlery made of aluminum, plastic and wood. None of these materials are suitable for daily use.\nCutlery design is not as diverse as, for example, the design of the dishes, but it is also necessary to be considered an aesthetic component is important. Ideally, all the utensils should be of the same material and the same decor.\nNow you can find a lot of different sets of different price categories and various configurations. There are sets of 24 items that will be enough for daily use, and 90 items, which are ideally suited for the reception of guests.\nKnives. Knives can be molded-in handle or monocoque (for their production steel rod of a certain diameter is flattened);with a hollow handle. A knife with a hollow handle consists of 3 parts: the blade and the handle component (sometimes when using certain parts of the design there can be even more, but at the same time only a few manufacturers can ensure the high quality.\nAt the “composite knife” blade is often made of steel 13/0 or 15/0 (containing 13% to 15% Cr). Such steel cuts better.\nThe handle of this knife is made up of two halves welded together inside, the emptiness between them is filled with special cement porcelain. The blade depth is input to the middle handle length, wherein the connecting seam is located on the handle, but on a new product, it is usually not visible due to polishing.\nA few words about the blade. Currently on the market there are knives with both tempered and non-tempered blades. Tempered steel is cheaper (by about 25 percent.), but at the application of pressure, it is bent and over time grows old (the spots are marked). Hardened steel is elastic, if the knife blade to bend and let go, it will take its original shape.\nBy purchasing cutlery, also make a point that their style accord with the dishes.\nThe restaurant owners often underestimate the importance of menu design. Surely you know that many restaurants offer rather unattractive menus to their visitors.\nToday we don’t want to cite somebody as example and claim that in our time any person must be interested in the design and understand it. After all, it’s not quite like that. Nowadays many people don’t pay special attention to the clothes, shoes, pieces of furniture. They don’t care how the restaurant menu looks like. Throughout their life they don’t want to devote their time to the design, functionality or aesthetics. It’s both good and bad, but you shouldn’t forget that there are people who care for such things.\nImagine that you enter the restaurant where everything creates a good impression: interior, service, music, food and menu design. The restaurant owners paying attention to all kinds of small articles are really proud of the care and consideration they give to create one or another article.\nOn the other hand, there are many restaurants where we want to eat as quickly and possible and leave.\nIf the restaurant makes a profit (even a little), why not to employ a professional designer who’ll develop a design of visit cards, menus, etc.? If you’re the restaurant owner who cares for the image of your establishment and business on the whole, you have to pay attention to this matter. And if you don’t want to invest in your own business, it tells volumes.\nMenu is an excellent way to create a pleasant impression of your restaurant with the visitors.\nThe marketing statistics shows that the successful design of restaurant or café menu helps to increase the sales approximately by 2-10 %.\nCreating the menu, many people forget that it’s necessary to enclose the visually beautiful design and right text layout (the choice of types). The menu design should be presentable and readable. The menu affects the first impression of the restaurant. Its’ interior and filling helps to determine the status of the restaurant or bar, etc. The main menu must show the range of dishes so “tasty” that the visitors want to try as many of them as possible.\nMaking the design of your restaurant menu, don’t forget about the dessert and wine list (or hookah list)."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:397e0b01-782f-4725-9a41-f6bfe49ae648>","<urn:uuid:bf9bdc52-7dce-4ead-bff5-04d819a5beee>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do psychological and social factors influence group decision-making, and what are the implications for emergency response situations?","answer":"Group decision-making is influenced by multiple psychological and social factors. While humans value autonomy, they often make decisions collectively to share responsibility and minimize personal risk of negative outcomes. This behavior is driven by emotional factors like fear of regret and desire to avoid personal responsibility. However, this can have serious implications in emergency situations, where the psychological tendency to look to others for guidance in ambiguous situations can lead to dangerous delays in response. The mind plays a crucial role, as people subconsciously assess the number of others present and their level of responsibility decreases accordingly. This psychological process often occurs automatically, leading to situations where despite having more potential helpers, victims may receive less assistance due to the diffusion of responsibility among the group.","context":["Post by Anastasia Sares\nWhat’s the science?\nCollective decision-making behaviors have been demonstrated in social animals like bees, ants, and fish. Humans are also social creatures, and like these other species, we often make decisions together, even though we strongly value autonomy. What benefit is there in giving up some of our autonomy and making a decision as a part of a group? This week in Nature Human Behavior, El Zein and colleagues suggested that we decide together in order to dilute risks and negative outcomes.\nWhat do we already know?\nPrevious research in this area has focused on whether collective decision-making results in a better decision overall. In some circumstances this process is helpful, but other times a group can get derailed and make a non-optimal decision. Since group decisions aren’t necessarily better in terms of accuracy, it is important to understand why we bother with them at all. After all, we like to have a choice when deciding what kind of product to buy, or what career to pursue. Some decisions are made together out of social obligation or a sense of fairness, but this may not account for all of the collective decision-making situations we observe.\nThe authors propose that one of the main reasons that individuals make decisions collectively is because it minimizes the risk taken by any one member. It’s what animals do when they herd or flock together, making it less likely that any one member is attacked (known as the dilution effect). Humans, even when they are not in physical danger, are very averse to certain emotional risks, especially regret or responsibility for a negative outcome. Making a decision as part of a group reduces the feeling of personal responsibility and can help us to cope with the stress of difficult decisions (like parents deciding whether or not to keep an injured child on life support). It may also protect us from social backlash (like when “whistleblowers” call out bad behavior of very powerful individuals). However, when taking the group perspective and not the individual perspective, the decrease of personal responsibility comes with its own problems: at worst, no one assumes responsibility for negative outcomes, and they are not addressed at all. Think of the bystander effect, where witnesses to an emergency situation are less likely to step in and help if others are present, or the tragedy of the commons, where individuals tend to over-use common resources.\nWhat's the bottom line?\nThere are a number of factors that push us toward collective decision-making: social inclusion and fairness, the idea that we are smarter together, and, as El Zein and colleagues emphasize, protection from negative consequences. In the future, it will be important to evaluate the relative contribution of these different factors in the drive to collective decision-making. This will help us better understand the behavior of the different social groups and governing bodies that permeate human society. Perhaps then we’ll know when to say, “many hands make light work” and when to say, “too many cooks spoil the broth.”\nEl Zein et al. Shared responsibility in collective decisions.

People do not act because their sense of responsibility is negatively affected. The responsibility is often diffused over the group that is present in the situation. Many factors play into what the outcome will be. Characteristics such as age, gender, and race will affect the decisions of the onlookers. In almost all cases people tend to think of themselves before others although, the tendency to choose themselves increases when there are more people present in a situation. Diffusion of responsibility goes against how a person would normally react to someone in need. Responsibility is diffused others and the bigger the group the less responsible people feel.\nThis whole research subject started when a young girl named Kitty Genovese was stabbed to death outside her home. Neighbors heard her screams for help, but no one came to her aid or called the police. None of the neighbors wanted to take responsibility for helping this girl and all thought someone else would help. This event led to the nationwide research on the subject of diffusion of responsibility.\nThe television show, “What would you do”, provides us with plenty of great live evidence at diffusion of responsibility occurring. This is the best source out there on this subject because viewers are seeing the phenomenon actually happen unbeknownst to the bystanders. The show specially picks factors to put into the act to entice the bystanders. For instance when a female is cheating behind a man’s back hardly anyone speaks up. However when the man cheats behind the woman’s back everyone speaks up. This proves how gender plays a huge role in the process of diffusion responsibility.\nThere have been many studies done over the years on diffusion of responsibility. One of my favorites was described in an article by Russ Dewey. Students met at Columbia University to fill out a questionnaire, they were divided into groups. One set was a small group where students were taking a test in a cubicle by themselves. Another set was a larger group of students that were taking the test in pairs. Then suddenly the students heard a loud crash then a woman screaming, “Oh My God, my foot! I can’t move it! Oh….my ankle…I can’t get this thing off me!” This was obviously staged, but the students didn’t know. Seventy percent of the students who were grouped alone reacted to the situation, however only forty percent of the students who were grouped in pairs reacted to the situation. The students all knew they were in a group. In the larger group people felt less responsible and continued testing thinking someone else would help them. In the smaller group a good percentage of people helped because the students felt more responsible for the girl. In this case there was less responsibility to be diffused.\nMany people believe that the bystanders’ actions are peculiar. People forget that the bystander believes he is not being judged or watched. The act of the bystander ignoring the victim is often caught on camera and this puzzles most people. A person would think that if someone was in need of assistance around a large group at least one person would step up and take action. However it is almost always not the case. Usually if there is a smaller group present it is more likely for someone to step up and help a victim. With a larger group most people diffuse the responsibly to someone else in the group and no one ends up helping.\nOverall the theory of diffusion of responsibility is a perplexing phenomenon. The theory doesn’t follow the social norm and surprises people often. In all scenarios responsibility is being diffused into the group and the victim is left in danger with no aid.\nIn a case of diffusion of responsibility a victim is being left helpless while responsibility is diffused among a crowd. For there to be a victim there has to an occurrence of a cause-and-effect situation. When this phenomenon happens it’s because a person or more commonly a group of people fail to act in a situation. The failure of action is spread throughout the group causing a mass non reaction to a potential dangerous situation for a victim. The process of diffusion of responsibility happens step by step and with the completion of each step the less likely someone is to react.\nThe steps to helping someone in a situation go as followed:\n1).notice an emergency 2) interpret event as an emergency 3) take responsibility 4) decide to help, 5) provide help. This method would be the expecting steps you would take in an emergency. However, when diffusion of responsibility occurs the first two steps are indeed noticed, but on the third step your mind will see that your help is need but will diffuse the responsibility on to someone else. So when someone needs help the five step process to helping someone becomes blurry at the third step and in many cases help is not granted. There are factors that contribute to you not lending assistance. Some of these factors include your mood, age, morals, pressure and confidence. All of these factors weigh against your conscience and cause you not to help, which in effect the victim is left unaided.\nAnother reason why people fail to help in these situations is because people often look to others for guidance in ambiguous situations. A person will think a cop will help or someone stronger. The fact is everyone is thinking that and this causing the delay and the responsibility to be diffused. Most people want to stay in the background in life and not cause to much attention to themselves. When someone is in trouble this trait comes out in people and they stay in the shadows. We all have experienced that awkward moment where we are asked to admit something, but we look to others around us before raising our hand or admitting something. The same goes when diffusion of responsibility occurs. When an individual is alone, they are responsible for their actions and act accordingly. However, in a group individuals will look to others for guidance. This happens especially in an intense situation or an emergency. This reaction will cause delay, and in many cases this is why bystanders are so late in helping a victim in need. In some cases this can even cause bystanders to assume that nothing needs to be done at all.\nWhen I was in high school I experienced a group diffusion of responsibility first hand. I was standing in the hallway before class and two kids that were mentally disabled were playing tag. They were usually followed by class aids, but at the time there were not any around. The bigger of the two kids started to get rough and pushed the smaller kid down to the ground really hard. There were probably about thirty kids around when this event occurred. The boy started to cry and everyone watched him do so, no one stepped forward right away. Then one of my friends and I stepped forward and lifted him up, then I went and got the teacher in the next room. Looking back on that experience I was stunned that no one stepped up and helped this poor kid right away. I even took a minute to help him because in my mind I was waited for someone else to step up and help him. The reason for the delay had a lot to do with how big the group was. Since the group was so large everyone looked around for someone else to help. If it had been a much smaller group people would have reacted quicker because they would feel more responsible. After this all happened everyone said that they were about to help or that they just froze for a minute and didn’t know why. This is because in their mind they didn’t feel responsible. They were not ready for this event to happen, so they did not act because there mind was caught off guard and responsibility began to diffuse to others.\nWhen I started researching this subject I thought of a project my friend Joe did in high school. He was studying diffusion of responsibility; he went to the mall and secretly filmed people’s reactions as he pretended to fall out of a wheelchair or fall on crutches. I interviewed him about the video and how people reacted when he fell. I asked him what the normal reaction was when he fell out of the wheelchair. He replied, “When there were a lot of people around almost everyone would ignore me and not help me, and then usually someone would finally get up and help me.” When there was only one or two people around they helped me most of the time.” In the end of the video he and his friend pretend to get in a fight. Joe’s friend then pushed him out of the wheelchair and onto the ground. Many people saw this happen, but no one helped for a long period of time, until a really big guy came by and made sure he was alright. It is obvious that no one wanted to take responsibility for this apparent act of bullying. Everyone around diffused there responsibility, they figure that really big guy would help and eventually he did. This proves that the more people around the longer the delay will be. Also the more people there are means less responsibility will be taken as a group.\nSo overall, delay causes diffusion of responsibility situations to occur. In most cases the delay is caused by assuming. For instance, people can assume a call has already been made to the police in an emergency. Or people will just flat out assume that someone else will help. Assuming anything is healthy it is better to be sure. In a large group people will look to others to assist before they do because of lack of confidence in many cases. The larger the group the more time will be taken up before help is granted. All these factors cause the phenomenon of Diffusion of Responsibility and the effect is a victim will not receive help when it is needed.\nSome people believe that the phenomenon of diffusion of responsibility stems from purely what you see. For example, a bystander will not help based on the victim’s race, gender, or age. Although this theory may be true the sub-conscience mind plays a much bigger role in the event of diffusion of responsibility. In the article, Diffusion of Responsibility: Are sexes more likely to help the same sex or the opposite sex? The Author’s position early on states that men will help in a situation before women do and will think about it less. He also said that female victims will be helped sooner. By the end this is how the results came back: “The hypothesis that participants will help the female confederate more than male confederate was not supported by this collection of data,” said Bell. This author disproves his own theory and only further strengthens the fact the mind plays the sub-conscience mind will play the biggest part when deciding to help or not.\nCountless studies have been done on diffusion of responsibility all results usually end up in the same boat. A bystander will diffuse responsibility to another before helping in a situation. There are more psychological aspects occurring then physical aspects. The physical aspects would be the a person’s understanding of a victim’s race, age, or gender, before deciding on what they are going to do. Some psychological aspects would be the feeling that you are not responsible for this event and therefore would diffuse the responsibility to others. That would be happening in your mind almost subconsciously. Another factor would be the amount of people around you. When this factor comes into play the bystander is not counting the people then just saying, “Oh one of them will handle this.” No a person subconsciously is aware of the amount of people and their responsibility level is lowered by the more people that are present.\nThe mind controls our body and sometimes the mind will go against your heart and you are not always responsible for this it is just human instinct at work. In the situations where a victim is in need most people will look back on it and say if i had another chance i would have done something, but there mind was telling them not too. Now there are people out there that will only look on the surface of things. These people will not help because they do not want to look foolish. This is nowhere near the broad consensus and contributing those types of reactions is not why this phenomenon occurs.\nThe reason why so many studies are done is study how the mind reacts to certain situations. If a person knew that they were being watched at all times then there reactions would be abnormal. Let’s say a woman was stealing a man’s backpack, would anyone help in this situation? Most likely no they would not help. You could poll people this question and the majority would say they wouldn’t help. If you ask a group of men the reverse, say a man was stealing a woman’s purse. Almost every man would say they would help. In reality a small number of these men would help. It has been proven in numerous studies. Your mind is generally going to react in your best interest and will delay and let someone else take the responsibility.\nOverall the mind plays a much bigger part when it comes to the phenomenon of diffusion of responsibility then the physical characteristics do. The mind really does rule all. When you are in a compromising position your mind can take over.\nDiffusion of responsibility goes against how a person would normally react to someone in need. Responsibility is diffused others and the bigger the group the less responsible people feel. Your mind is known to play tricks on you and take over your senses. When diffusion of responsibility occurs your mind takes over and it goes over your surrounding. In many cases your responsibility is diffused because of the various factors that occur in your mind that tell a person not to react to a potentially dangerous situation. Diffusion of responsibility is a very interesting concept and now I know a great deal about it.\nDewey.” Diffusion of Responsibility | in Chapter 15: Social | from Psychology: An Introduction by Russ Dewey.

{"question":"How do the musical instruments drilbu from Tibetan Buddhist rituals and the African Udu drum compare in terms of their ceremonial functions and sound production methods?","answer":"The drilbu (hand bell) and Udu drum serve different ceremonial purposes and produce sounds in distinct ways. The drilbu is played in the left hand at heart level, held at the middle of the handle and swung back and forth on its fulcrum.

It is served to distinguish a product or service from others in the trade. A trademark coupled with a brilliant branding strategy could make millions even billions for a company. Given the importance of a trademark, registration of trademark is always a priority of a sophisticated entrepreneur.\nHowever, many entrepreneurs are perplexed by the complexity and tediousness of the trademark registration process and requirements. No worries, here’s the step by step guide on how to register a trademark.\nAlthough this article focuses on trademark registration process in Malaysia, the process is also similar in other jurisdictions.\nStep 1: Design a Trademark.\nYes, it is elementary. Still, many are confused that a trademark only means logo, actually more than that! According to the definition of Trademarks Act 2019 of Malaysia, a trademark means any sign includes any letter, word, name, signature, numeral, device, brand, heading, label, ticket, shape of goods or their packaging, colour, sound, scent, hologram, positioning or sequence of motion or any combination thereof that is capable of being represented graphically, at the same time, it is also capable of distinguishing goods or services of one undertaking from the others.\nOther than being creative and eye-catchy, a trademark should fulfil all requirements under the Malaysian Trademarks Act 2019, especially it should not fall foul of the absolute and relative grounds of refusal.\nStep 2: List Down the Goods / Services Under the Trademark and Determine the Classification\nA trademark is protected in respect of the goods and/or services. Therefore, it is essential to deliberate the exact list of goods and/or services that are being provided under the trademark. Thereafter, identify the relevant classes under Nice Classification.\nThis step is crucial because the specification of goods or services determine the scope of protection of the trademark. The trademark may not be protected on the goods or services that are not covered in the registration. By all mean, cover as much classes as possible!\nIn view of the gravity, triple check the list of goods and services of the trademark to ensure its comprehensive protection!\nStep 3: Do a Pre-Filing Trademark Search\nBefore filing the trademark application, it is advisable to conduct a pre-filing search and analysis to evaluate the chances of registration of the trademark. The searches will focus on the earlier marks in database of the Trademark Registry. Nevertheless, the searches can be expanded to cover the database in other jurisdictions.\nThe unofficial search is entirely optional and not part of the official registration process. The applicant may also request for an official pre-filing search from the Malaysian Registry of Trademarks. Nonetheless, this step is highly advisable in order to check if there is any identical or similar marks. Most of the time the Trademark Offices will take a few months or even more than a year to issue decision on a trademark application. Therefore, we would not want to only know our trademark is not registrable only a year later.\nWe can, of course, conduct the trademark searches ourselves as the many countries have made the database publicly accessible. However, A trademark search certainly is not as simple as just type in the name! It is prudent to engage a competent trademark agent or attorney who knows how to conduct a trademark search more effectively, accurately and, consider the relevant provisions in the Trademarks law, for example the absolute and relative grounds of refusal.\nA trademark search is certainly not a glance at the crystal ball, but we could gauge the chances of success of the trademark registration, by looking into the sighted marks and the relevant provisions in the Trademarks Act.\nStep 4: Identify the Trademark Owner\nPursuant to the Malaysian Trademarks Act 2019, it is permissible to register the trademark in the name of individual, company or other organisation.\nIt is advisable to think twice at this stage to identify the desired owners so that we could avoid the extra cost to transfer the trademark ownership in future, unless necessary.\nStep 5: Prepare and File Trademark Application\nGenerally, filing a trademark application in Malaysia requires the following information:-\n1. Full name of the trademark applicant\n2. Full address of the applicant\n3. List of goods and services provided under the trademark\n4. Class number (Nice Classification for filing in Malaysia)\n5. A softcopy of the trademark in high resolution\n6. Priority information, if priority right is being claimed\n7. Certified translation of the trademark if it contains non-Roman characters.\nDifferent countries may have different formality and documentation requirements for filing trademark applications. For example, China only requires a simply signed Power of Attorney, whereas Thailand requires the Power of Attorney to be notarized by a Notary Public. On the other hand, trademark applicants in United States are required to state the basis of applications.\nTherefore, it is advisable to consult a competent trademark agent or attorney on the detailed requirements of filing a trademark application, to avoid any unnecessary refusal or office action.\nOnce the information is ready, we may proceed the application by filing the relevant official forms and paying the prescribed fees. The cost of trademark application will multiply according to the number of classes selected.\nAfter the application has been filed, we still cannot use ® on our trademark. In Malaysia, it is an offence to represent a trademark as registered without complete registration, which upon conviction, shall be liable to a fine not exceeding RM10,000.00. In this regard, many countries has similar law too.\nTherefore, we have to wait for the trademark to be registered in order to use the ® sign. At this stage, we could use the \"TM\" sign with our trademark.\nStep 6: Examination by Trademark Examiner\nAfter filing the trademark application, the Registrar of Trademarks will verify the documents and information submitted, this is known as Formality Examination. If any irregularities are found on the trademark application, the applicant will be given opportunity to respond or rectify the irregularities.\nOnce the formality requirements have been complied, the Registrar of Trademarks will proceed to conduct substantive examination on the trademark to examine the registrability of the trademark under the requirements of the Trademarks Act 2019, for example, whether the trademark is devoid of any distinctive character, whether the trademark falls under of the absolute or relative grounds of refusal, whether the trademark is contrary to public interest or moral.\nThe Registrar of Trademark of Malaysia would generally take about 6 to 12 months to examine a trademark application. Other countries may have different timeline.\nIf the trademark application does not fulfil any requirements under the Trademarks Act 2019, the Registrar will issue a refusal notice. Indeed, the applicant will be given opportunity to respond to the said refusal, or amend the trademark application, whichever necessary.\nStep 7: Publication in Malaysian IP Official Journal\nOnce the Registrar finds the trademark application fulfils the requirements under the Trademarks Act 2019, the trademark will be accepted and it will proceed to advertisement in the Malaysian IP Official Journal. Within 2 months from the date of advertisement, the public is given the opportunity to oppose the trademark registration.\nIn the event that someone opposes the trademark registration, the trademark application will enter into a separate opposition proceedings to determine the registration. This process involves filing of notice of opposition, counter statement, exchange of statutory declarations and legal submissions between the parties. We will be sharing this proceedings separately.\nIf no opposition is filed, the trademark will be registered in respect of the goods or services.\nStep 8: Registration of Trademark\nUpon registration, the Registrar shall issue a notification of registration of the trademark with the seal of the Registrar. The registered proprietor may make a request if he wishes to have a certificate of registration, the Registrar shall issue the certificate of registration which shall be equivalent to the notification of trademark.\nAt this point the registered trademark proprietor may use the ® sign with the trademark. The trademark is now protected and the proprietor is granted exclusive use on the trademark in respect of the registered goods or services for a period of 10 years from the date of filing. Technically, the registration of trademark is perpetual as long as it is renewed every 10 years.\nA smooth trademark registration process usually takes about 12 to 18 months from the date of filing. It will take longer if the application encounters any office action or opposition proceedings during the registration process.\nNow the trademark has been successfully registered, remember to review your registration from time to time to ensure its validity. Some countries may have post registration compliance to be observed to maintain the trademark.\nLast but not least, contact us today to engage our professional services to protect your trademark.\nRegistered Trademark, Patent and Design Agent\nLL.B (HONS), CLP\nAdvocate & Solicitor (Non-Practising)\nBachelor of Communication\nDisclaimer: The above information is merely for general sharing and does not constitute any legal advice.

{"question":"Is a bow square more specialized in its measurement functions compared to a Vernier caliper?","answer":"Yes, a bow square is more specialized than a Vernier caliper. A bow square is specifically designed for archery measurements like brace height, nocking point, and tiller measurements on both compound and recurve bows. In contrast, Vernier calipers are versatile tools that can measure round and flat surfaces, act as depth gauges, and typically measure from zero to six inches or more across various applications.","context":["When you get a new bow, you need to learn several things to set it up and use it properly. As an archer, you have to know about the bow height, draw weight, draw length, and many other factors. However, one more important factor that you would come across is the brace height, which is a measure of the distance between the deepest part of the bow grip and the bowstring.\nThe brace height is an important factor because it also affects your performance as an archer, and it also determines how much room for error you have when you are targeting and shooting an arrow. If you want to adjust the brace height, you can make use of a bow square. This article covers everything you need a bow square, its usage and importance.\nWhat is a Bow Square?\nA bow square is a measurement tool that is specially designed to measure the brace height, and it can be used for a number of purposes when you are setting up your bow. Also called a T-string, it features a ruler with a horizontal bar attached to it, which is used to clip or attach the bow square to the bow grip or the string. There are measurement values calibrated on both the horizontal and vertical parts of the T-string.\nThe bow square can be used on both compound and recurve bows, which makes it a versatile tool for both professional archers and archery enthusiasts. Bow squares are typically available in flat or rounded edges. Compound archers tend to make use of the rounded edges, whereas the recurve archers benefit from the flat edges.\nUsing a Bow Square\nNow that you are familiar with the use of a bow square, it is also important to learn all that you can do with it. Let’s have a look at all of the ways in which you can use a bow square, whether you are a recurve or compound archer.\n1. Setting the Nocking Point\nIn recurve bows, you have to set the nocking point, which is located on the bowstring and allows you to carefully position the arrow before you can draw the bowstring and release it to shoot the arrow. If you want to do so, you can clamp the horizontal part of the bow square to the bowstring and the other end on the arrow rest or shelf where the arrow is positioned for stability.\nOnce this is done, you can make use of the measurement markings to position the nocking point on your bow. It will take some trial and error, and you will have to try placing your arrow on the bow every time you set the nocking point. Once you have found the sweet spot, you can read the marking on the bow square and remember it, so that you don’t have to spend any time in setting up your bow the next time.\n2. Measuring the Top Limb Tiller\nThe tiller measurement refers to the way you can hold the bow. If you don’t set it according to your archery preferences and requirements, then your bow will lean backwards or forwards. The tiller measurement also makes sure that both the limbs are properly aligned and move together when you shoot the arrow. Most archers consider the tiller measurement to be equal between the bowstring and the limbs, whereas other archers think one should be longer than the other. The tiller measurements can be adjusted with the help of turning the limb bolts present on your bow.\nTo adjust the tiller measurement for both the limbs, you can place the horizontal bar of the bow square with the bow grip, whereas the horizontal end extends towards the bowstring. While you hold the bow square in place, you can adjust the limb bolts to reach the proper measurement. After each adjustment, you can try drawing the string and releasing it to see how the limbs respond. If you have found the right measurement, you can make a note of it for the future.\n3. Measuring the Brace Height\nOne of the most common and popular uses of a bow square is to measure the brace height, which refers to the distance between the bow grip and bowstring. This measurement is integral to the speed and accuracy of your bow, and also determines how much room you have for inaccuracy. The shorter the brace height, the more difficult it will be for the archer to shoot the arrow at the target.\nThe bow square is used to measure the brace height and adjust it accordingly, so that you can experience the perfect shooting performance you need to hit bullseye every time. To measure the brace height, you can place the horizontal part of the T-Square with the deepest part of the grip, which is usually the point from where the archer grips it. When you place it in this manner, the ruler part of the T-Square will coincide with your bowstring at some point, and you can check the measurement against this point in inches.\nOnce you have measured the brace height, you can decide if you want to increase or decrease it. Usually, you can unstring the bowstring from the bottom limb and add twists on it. This will decrease the brace height once you put the string back in place. Then, if you need to increase the brace height, you can remove the twists, or get a new and longer bowstring to replace your existing one.\nSimilar to these, compound archers also make use of the bow square to set the position of the D-loop on their bow. Therefore, a bow square is a handy and useful tool that you should consider buying along with your bow, so that you don’t have to worry about adjusting or tweaking your bow for the perfect performance and response. Although it is said that the archer’s skill is more integral than the gear they use, a bow square will help you get there much easier.","If you work on cars, the need to measure is never far away. Accurately identifying a length, width, depth, thread (pitch) or any other size is not only frequently necessary, but it makes the task at hand much easier by eliminating guesswork, particularly when it comes to selecting fasteners.\nArticle continues after advertisement\nBut sizing a bolt is not the only time you will need to accurately measure something when working on your vehicle. Proficiency in measuring goes hand in hand with working with any form of machinery, especially a car. You may need to calculate a linear measurement for a non-linear item such as a brake or fuel line. Other situations may require you to know a precise dimension, as when you're calculating the length of a head bolt, or even something less critical like the size of the heater core outlet. Measuring can also be part of a diagnostic step, as is the case with ride height, valve-spring installed height or breaker-point gap. Like it or not, taking physical measurements is a part of muscle car ownership.\nThis installment in the Lost Art series is meant to provide an overview of practical measuring techniques and tools. Since it's a general overview, the topics covered will be very eclectic, ranging from reading a micrometer to gapping a spark plug. Once you master the basic skills of measuring, you can apply them to any other component or use. If you can accurately measure a piece of steel tubing with a micrometer, then you can also precisely measure a crankshaft journal or any other engine part. But as with any new skill that you are learning, it is always best to start out with a simple procedure, and move on to more complex measurements as your ability improves.\nBecoming proficient in measuring requires a commitment. You will need to decide what instruments you will invest in, and then take the time to learn to use them, rather than just placing them in your toolbox until the day you need to measure something. The best approach when learning how to measure is to invest in one tool; then work and practice with it until you can quickly and accurately read dimensions. Once you master that tool, you can buy the next one.\nThe best measuring tools for the muscle car owner to invest in would be:\nAccurate tape measure\nVernier or dial caliper\nMachinist's steel ruler/straight edge\nSpark-plug feeler gauge\nAs your skills progress and you get more involved with taking measurements, you can consider:\nDial indicator with magnetic stand\nSnap or telescoping gauges\nDial bore gauge\nThere are many other measuring tools on the market, such as radius gauges, small-hole ball gauges, calipers and dividers, and so on. There are also engine-specific measurement tools, which are those designed to perform a specific task on a particular engine. However, unless you work on the same type of engine regularly (or you're just an equipment buff), these specialized tools probably won't do you much good; for most hobbyists, they're a waste of resources.\nThough the quality and accuracy of measuring tools varies greatly with price, an excellent source is The L.S. Starrett Company. Starrett offers a full line of affordable, American-made measurement tools that are second to none. In addition, the company has excellent training aids and literature. Their Tools and Rules for Precision Measuring (Bulletin #1211\n) is available free of charge. A worthwhile investment of only $14.50 will allow you to own the excellent The Starrett Book for Student Machinists\n, catalogued under part number 1700. This printed material will prove an invaluable guide when learning how to read your new measuring tools; it's a reference that will never become outdated.\nHands on: Practical Application\nToday, there are digital measuring tools that let you read the dimension the old-fashioned and proper way (on the scale of the tool), but that allow a novice to get started quickly in the measuring field. What digital tools do not supply as readily as the scaled design is the feel for the instrument and component--the tools themselves are often clumsy, digital micrometers especially so. Though some may argue this point, and there is no question of the accuracy of a quality digital tool, a better learning experience is gleaned from a traditional scaled tool than a modern, electronically enhanced version. But a tool that offers both digital and scaled readings can be a smart investment for the novice since it can be used as a tutorial. You can view a reading on the digital display and then confirm that value on the scale; this is a good method for self-educating.\nThe key element of accurate measurement lies in the sight and touch of the operator. Touch is particularly important when using any measurement device, and this is something each individual needs to cultivate and refine. A skilled machinist has a very highly developed sense of touch that can detect the slightest change in the tool's contact with the piece being measured. In the human hand, the sense of touch is most prominent in the fingertips. Thus, contact-type measuring tools should be properly balanced in your hand and held lightly and delicately, in such a manner as to bring the fingers into play in handling and moving the tool. If you are clumsy or grab the tool with authority, the amount of feel is greatly diminished.\nMicrometer Measuring Tips\nMicrometers can be considered either inside, outside or depth. The most common micrometer for automotive use is the outside version.\nOutside micrometers are usually produced with a measuring range of one inch. Thus, each model is catalogued by its range of measurement: 0-1, 1-2, 4-5, and so on. The size or sizes that you acquire will depend on the dimensions of the items you will be measuring.\nRegardless of range, all micrometers are read and used the same way. If you want to measure pistons in most American V-8 engines, then you need a 4-5-inch micrometer: A standard small-block Chevy 350 and a 302 Ford use a 4.00-inch bore piston from the factory and are commonly rebuilt with a 0.030-inch overbore. But that same instrument would not be useful to check a piston on a Buick V-6 with a 3.800-inch bore. For this reason, many engine builders have a 3-4-inch micrometer, along with a 4-5-inch version, in their collection.\nIf you plan on measuring much smaller parts, such as valve stems, you'll need a 0-1-inch micrometer. I suggest getting a 0-1 inch micrometer as your first instrument, since it will be easier to measure smaller, common things such as a ballpoint pen, pencil or steel tube to learn the proper feel instead of working with a clumsy part such as a piston while trying to accurately operate a rather large micrometer.\nA standard micrometer is designed to be read in thousandths of an inch. One-thousandth of an inch is the approximate thickness of the cellophane in a pack of cigarettes, and is read as 0.001-inch.\nWhen gripping the frame of an outside micrometer, your thumb and forefinger need to be free to operate the thimble. Very light pressure of the thumb and forefinger is all that is required when contacting the item to be measured. Some better micrometers have an internal ratchet stop that will identify when the proper contact pressure has been reached.\nSome helpful micrometer tips for the beginner:\nWipe the micrometer clean of dust and oil after every use.\nDo not open or close by holding onto the thimble and spinning the frame around the spindle axis.\nNever drop a micrometer; this can spring the frame and cause misalignment between the anvil and the spindle faces.\nMake sure the spindle face does not touch the anvil when storing, since temperature changes can spring it.\nDo not touch the anvil and spindle faces with your fingers. Moisture and oils from your skin can promote corrosion.\nPrior to using a micrometer, clean the measuring surface by sliding a piece of paper held between the anvil and spindle faces.\nOther Useful Instruments\nSlide calipers come in either Vernier or dial designs. They are very useful tools, since they can measure round and flat surfaces while also acting as a depth gauge, although with less accuracy than a dedicated depth micrometer.\nA Vernier or dial caliper is easy to use to obtain a quick measurement and usually provides a much larger range than a micrometer--it can measure zero to six inches or even beyond. The tool is excellent for measuring bolt-hole depth by using the depth rod at the end. Simply place the bar of the caliper on the engine block deck and send the depth rod down into the hole. When it stops, read the scale for the maximum bolt length.\nAnother useful tool is a dial indicator with a magnetic stand. This allows for accurate and fast measurement of movement such as the backlash in a differential gear set, the free play in a crankshaft or camshaft and the lift of a valve. The dial indicator and magnetic stand can also be used to determine run-out on a surface such as a flywheel or brake rotor.\nThe straightedge and feeler gauge are essential to determine if there is any warpage on a flange, such as where the intake manifold mates to the cylinder head. You can also check the straightness of a cylinder head or block deck by placing the straightedge on the surface and finding the thickest feeler gauge that will fit between the two. Once the maximum amount of deviation is recorded, a caliper or micrometer can be used to measure the gasket thickness. This will tell you if the part will seal up. For example, if the flange has a .020-inch variation but the gasket is .045-inch thick, it will seal with no problem, as the gasket is more than twice as thick as the greatest amount of warpage.\nMake it Fun\nOnce you become comfortable with using measuring tools, you will not want to be without them. From that point on, you will never accept any statement as fact unless accurate numbers are attached to it. Measuring is not only enjoyable, but it brings you into harmony with the mechanical device you're working on, as you are now intimately familiar with its dimensions. And a machine that you are one with always runs the best.\nTo read the micrometer, multiply the number of vertical divisions visible on the sleeve by 25. Then add the number of divisions on the bevel of the thimble, counting from zero to the mark that coincides with the long horizontal line on the sleeve.\nIn some instances, you may need a more accurate measurement that is read down to 0.0001-inch. To accomplish this, your instrument must have a Vernier scale. The Vernier scale lines are all mismatched with the opposing scale except for one. The number that matches is the ten-thousandths value. A caliper is shown, but micrometers can have a similar scale on the back of the sleeve.\nAn outside micrometer should always be stored open so that any temperature change will not skew its accuracy.\nA caliper or a micrometer can be used to identify a bolt thread size, though you will need to convert the decimal reading into a fraction.\nA caliper can quickly identify the length of a bolt and the depth rod can determine the depth of the hole.\nTelescoping or \"snap\" gauges can read the inside of a hole, but then need to have the dimension transferred to either a micrometer or caliper.\nWhen using a feeler gauge, make sure that you hold the part and the tool straight or the reading will be faulty. When moving the feeler gauge, you should feel a drag on both sides.\nA thread gauge is used to identify the pitch and count on a fastener.\nAngle gauges determine the pitch of a tapered surface.\nA radius gauge is required to determine the radius of an arc.\nA tire micrometer accurately measures tread depth. The subject tool reads in both 1/32-inch increments and in millimeters.\nThe best way to measure items such as fuel or brake lines that have kinks and bends in them is to follow the contour with soft welding rod, thin electrical wire or string. Feed the measuring material along the line and when done, use a tape measure to determine the entire length.\nThis article originally appeared in the March, 2010 issue of Hemmings Muscle Machines.\nOrder Backissues of Hemmings Muscle Machines\nSubscribe to Hemmings Muscle Machines"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7d698b0b-0263-4eab-bb51-6929a800bb64>","<urn:uuid:24e4aaa1-e645-43eb-a62a-1597c4c0119d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"For my neuroscience thesis, could you compare the clinical implications of working memory's pain suppression versus conventional pain medications in treating chronic pain?","answer":"Working memory's pain suppression mechanism offers a top-down way of controlling attention to nociceptive stimuli, which could be particularly useful in chronic pain states where the brain shows heightened sensitivity to threat signals. By engaging working memory during clinical tasks, practitioners can improve task performance while decreasing nociceptive input. In contrast, conventional pain medications have serious limitations - they are ineffective for many chronic pain patients and come with serious side effects. This has led researchers to seek new treatment approaches, such as targeting the reward circuits activated by pain relief.","context":["I was reading Valery Legrain’s blog and it caused me to reflect on what sort of daily use I give my working memory. Have I needed to mentally rehearse a phone number while dialling it? No, my phone dials whoever I ask it to. Have I bothered to calculate the amount of change I’m going to get at the checkout because the young assistant looks like they can’t? Well that’s just silly – it’s what a cash register is for. But, these tasks used to be common place and they are excellent examples of using one’s working memory. With smart technology these days, all you need do is get on with life while silicon chips work out the answer.\nThis could be troublesome if it spells a loss of working memory function. In their paper, Legrain, Crombez et al (2011) reported that mental rehearsal such as occurs during a working memory task, suppressed the ability of a nociceptive stimulus to distract attention. The nifty method they used to test this teased out the contributions of working memory from a general shift in attention load (read Valery’s blog or the paper for a deeper coverage of this); a factor widely acknowledged to influence the amount of cognitive processing allocated to nociceptive stimuli.\nJust to recap, subjects participated in two sessions: a) a colour discrimination task and b) a colour matching task. Each task involved two conditions: a response according to the current image or a response according to the previous image (1-back task involving mental rehearsal and working memory). Prior to seeing the image, subjects were given either a tactile (tactile-visual) or a nociceptive (nociceptive-visual) stimulus. They didn’t know which one was coming.\nIn the current image tasks, subjects responded significantly slower to the nociceptive-visual trials than tactile-visual trials, that is the nociceptive stimulus intruded and disrupted the task. But, when working memory was engaged (the 1-back tasks), there was no significant difference in response time between the two trials. This was a consistent finding, despite decreased attentional load in the first task, and showed that suppression of nociceptive messages was due to the activity of the working memory.\nThe ability for working memory to suppress nociceptive message processing is an important issue. Firstly it means that there are top down ways of controlling the amount of attention paid to nociceptive stimuli. This could be something to explore further in chronic pain states where the brain may show an over-eagerness to listen to incoming signals of threat (Crombez, Van Damme et al. 2005). Secondly, by reducing the ability for the nociceptive messages to intrude, task oriented brain activities are preserved and further processing that could result in the perception of pain is likely to be reduced.\nIn the clinic a bit of thought to the sequence and style in which we do things can capitalise on the idea of facilitating working memory to improve task output and decrease nociceptive input. For example, guiding a client’s foot through heel strike to toe off at the same time as asking them to make a mental image of the feeling (not pain-related, but proprioceptive and sensory) of it can be the 1-back task. If we ask them to rehearse that mental image while preparing to produce the same motor pattern by themselves, and then to match the mental image with a physical task, we are achieving our goals. I am tempted to say that repetition may reinforce improvement, so it could be a long session on the floor!\nWorking memory is your ‘here and now’ memory which means to capitalise on using it we need focus during clinic time. Focus on the goals and tasks and away from the pain. Anyway, it seems it is time the memory worked again, before we forget where to find it!\nCarolyn has been teaching with the Noisters (Neuro Orthopaedic Institute) for the last 10 years and finally got herself into research via a very competitive post-graduate scholarship. Not that she has every stopped studying – she already has a masters in physiotherapy and in pain science – good luck fitting PhD onto the business card! What is Carolyn researching for her PhD? Based at the University of South Australia in Adelaide Carolyn is looking at neurophysiological profiles between chronic pain and PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder) during working memory tasks.\nWhat does Carolyn do day to day? She is under piles of papers doing a systematic review of working memory and cognitive impairment in chronic pain. Carolyn will then be using EEG to evaluate what happens in people with pain. When she is not in the office, she lives on an island 100 kms south of Adelaide (that’s a long commute!) and spends her off-time playing with family, sailing and walking. Here is Carolyn talking more about the research she is doing.\nCrombez G, Van Damme S, & Eccleston C (2005). Hypervigilance to pain: an experimental and clinical analysis.

Porreca's current research focuses on the mechanisms of chronic pain states, including neuropathic, inflammatory, visceral, headache and cancer pain and mechanisms of opioid-induced hyperalgesia, a clinical phenomenon characterized by worsening pain, despite increasing doses of opioids.\nHe has served as editor-in-chief of Life Sciences, as editor of the Pharmacology Section for Pain and has authored more than 450 peer-reviewed papers. He is involved with numerous professional societies and is the founder and scientific organizer of the Spring Pain Research Conference, a biennial conference that attracts world renowned members of pain laboratories in both academia and industry.\nAbout the UA Pain Research Group:\nThe Pain Research Group at the UA College of Medicine studies the underlying causes of acute and chronic pain to promote the discovery of new targets for drug development with the ultimate goal of improved pain management. Current areas of investigation include cancer pain, skeletal pain, neuropathic pain, headache pain and inflammatory pain.\nThe group is a multidisciplinary team consisting primarily of faculty from the UA department of pharmacology who collaborate with members of the UA Cancer Center; the UA Sarver Heart Center; the UA College of Medicine's departments of anesthesiology, pathology and neurology; the UA College of Science's departments of molecular and cellular biology and chemistry and biochemistry, as well as with many extramural collaborators. The expertise of the group's investigators encompasses a spectrum of molecular, neuroanatomical, neurochemical and neuropharmacological techniques.\nAbout the UA Department of Pharmacology:\nOne of five basic science departments at the UA College of Medicine, the department of pharmacology conducts cutting edge research on human diseases and their treatments. Areas of study include cancer, cardiovascular disease, immunopharmacology, toxicology, neurosciences and pain. Department faculty members seek to improve understanding of mechanisms of disease to promote the development of improved therapies and outcomes. The department educates medical and other health sciences students, physicians and scientists in all areas of pharmacology.\nOne in three Americans will suffer from chronic pain at some point in their lives, resulting in an estimated $635 billion per year in medical treatment and lost productivity.\nTo better understand the multiple dimensions of pain, including sensory, emotional and cognitive aspects, Frank Porreca and his research group in the department of pharmacology in the University of Arizona College of Medicine have been awarded a $2.5 million, five-year R01 grant from the National Institute on Drug Abuse of the National Institutes of Health.\nDr. David Borsook, professor of anesthesiology at Harvard Medical School, is a co-investigator on the 1 R01 DA 034975-01grant.\nChronic pain is defined as any pain lasting more than 12 weeks or pain that is longer than the expected time of healing. Whereas acute pain is a normal and essential mechanism that protects us from injuries, chronic pain is very different. Chronic pain persists after injuries have resolved, does not serve any useful purpose and is a burden to patients and society.\nPorreca, UA professor of pharmacology and anesthesiology, and his laboratory study the neural circuits mediating pain in the brain and the spinal cord. In a key finding, the team has demonstrated that treatments that relieve the unpleasant feeling of pain also activate reward circuits and reinforce behaviors that result in the relief of pain.\n\"Pain is an emotion, both a sensation and a motivation. It is the unpleasantness of pain that produces strong motivation to get rid of it and to seek relief,\" Porreca said.\n\"Pain can be thought of as analogous to other aversive states that produce motivation. For example, hunger is an aversive state, and when we are hungry we are motivated to seek relief and find food; when we are thirsty we are motivated to seek water; and when we are cold we are motivated to seek warmth. Relief of the aversive states, including pain, is rewarding. We are studying the reward circuits in the brain and their response to the relief of the aversiveness of pain,\" Porreca explained.\nPorreca's team is evaluating the activation of brain reward circuits as a way to identify new treatments that effectively relieve pain so that new medications can be discovered. There are multiple competing emotions that create motivational drives, Porreca says, and \"we have to investigate the brain mechanisms that underlie chronic pain in order to discover more effective medications.\"\n\"Pain is a complex individual experience that depends on the context in which injuries may occur. We have to determine whether it is appropriate to respond to pain or to take other, more imperative action,\" Porreca said. \"For example, in a safe setting you respond to the pain and attend to the injury that may have caused it. However, in a situation where there is a threat to survival, responding to pain is less important.\"\nStress can suppress pain so that escape and survival are possible, Porreca said. For example, someone injured in an automobile accident might lack pain immediately following the incident, or an athlete might lack pain following an injury during the height of competition. Porreca explained that the mechanism for pain probably has been activated in each instance, but the brain can modulate the process that produces the pain within the context of the injury.\nConversely, in chronic pain conditions, the brain may enhance or exaggerate the experience of pain and such conditions are very difficult to treat with conventional pain medications.\n\"Current medications used for chronic pain are ineffective for many people and have serious side-effects,\" Porreca said. \"The novel demonstration of pain relief as a reward provides an entirely new way to discover medicines for patients.\"\nPorreca collaborates with a multidisciplinary team at the UA that includes Regents Professor Emeritus Victor Hruby and professor Robin Polt, both with the department of chemistry and biochemistry.\nPorreca works closely with research professor of pharmacology Michael Ossipov and assistant research scientists Milena De Felice, Jennifer Xie and Edita Navratilova, along with postdoctoral fellows, graduate students and visiting research fellows."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3ceb4681-16b8-4f27-b7df-ca80dfce770d>","<urn:uuid:36c84b42-f85c-4bbd-88a7-7665064c1519>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the requirements for insurance and safety checks between a standard driving test vehicle and a superyacht over 15m in length operating in Queensland waters?","answer":"For driving test vehicles, safety checks include the 'Show Me, Tell Me' questions testing basic car maintenance knowledge, with failure resulting in one minor fault. Drivers must also demonstrate understanding of all controls and instruments related to road safety. For superyachts over 15m in length, legislation requires insurance sufficient to cover potential pollution clean up, salvage and wreck removal. Additionally, superyacht operators must maintain specific safety protocols including following COLREGS, maintaining VHF Ch16 listening watch, and following Maritime Safety Queensland directions. Superyachts must also maintain minimum under keel clearance requirements of 1.0 metre in the Gold Coast Seaway Entrance and 0.5 metres in other Southport Broadwater areas.","context":["DVSA Driving Test Syllabus\nThe Driving Standards Agency (DSA), the people responsible for setting of the driving test, have produced a syllabus, which covers all aspects of learning to drive a car.\nThis syllabus is the course you must learn in order to pass the practical driving test. It is recommended that you make sure your driving instructor teaches the full syllabus.\nAs you learn the syllabus should should progress through five skill levels. Once you have consistently reached level five you should be ready to take, and pass, your driving test. The five skill levels are:\n- the skill is introduced\n- the skill can be carried out under full instruction\n- the skill can be carried out correctly when prompted\n- the skill seldom needs to be prompted\n- the pupil can carry the skill out consistently and without any prompting.\nThe current DSA is as follows:\nHave a sound knowledge of the Highway Code is essential. You should start learning it before you even start your driving lessons.\nThese are the checks you should make inside the car before staring the engine.\nVehicle Safety Checks\nAlso known as the Show Me, Tell Questions. The checks are designed to test your knowledge and understanding of basic car maintenance.\nAt the start of the practical driving test you will be asked one show me and one tell me question. Failure to answer one or both of the questions correctly will result in your scoring one minor fault.\nControls and Instruments\nYou will need to understand the function of all controls and switches in the car, especially those that relate to road safety.\n- Foot controls: accelerator, clutch, foot brake.\n- Hand controls: parking brake, steering wheel, indicators, gear stick.\nYou will also need to show appropriate use of indicators, lights, windscreen wipers, demisters and heaters.\nUsing these controls needs to be second nature. You should never need to look at a control before or whilst using it, as this means you will be looking away from the road ahead.\nYou will also need to the function and meaning of your car’s hazard warning lights.\nMoving Away and Stopping\nYou will need to know the correct procedures for moving away and stopping. You will need to demonstrate that you can perform these manoeuvres safely and under control whilst on the level and on a hill.\nAs with all manoeuvres you will need to use the MSM and PSL routines.\nMirror – Signal – Manoeuvre (MSM)\n- Mirror – use your mirrors to check the position of traffic around and behind you.\n- Signal – show others what you intend to do.

Early use of mirrors must be made before signalling, changing direction and/or speed, and as part of the mirror-signal-manoeuvre routine.\nYou should know the differences between the different car mirrors and know when and how to use them.\nYou should understand blind spots and how to deal with them.\nYou will need the knowledge and understanding to give clear, well-timed signals to other road users and have the ability to respond correctly to signals given by other road users.\nAnticipation and Planning\nYou will need to be able to identify emerging hazards and respond to them safely. Constant observation is key to this.\nYou will need to:\n- Think and plan ahead and anticipate the actions of others road users.\n- identify hazards from clues and respond to them safely\n- recognise times, places and conditions which mean there is a higher risk.\n- Demonstrate safe attitudes when dealing with vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists and horse riders.\nUse of Speed\nSafe and reasonable progress should be made according to the road, weather and traffic conditions, the road signs and speed limits.\nYou will need to know:\n- the various speed limits and restrictions for different types of road\n- how weather conditions affect the speed you use\n- the stopping distances for your vehicle in different conditions\n- how to calculate a safe separation distance between yourself and the vehicle in front\nYou will need to be able to deal safely and confidently with meeting, crossing and overtaking other vehicles.\nMeeting traffic – give way to oncoming traffic when obstacles such as parked cars block your side of the road. On narrow roads you should be prepared to use passing places.\nCrossing traffic – when turning right you must position you car correctly, as close to the centre of the road as it is safe to do so, give way to oncoming traffic, make the turn without cutting the corner or taking the turn too widely.\nOvertaking – know when it is legal and safe to overtake. Check and assess the speed and position of vehicles behind you, in front and coming towards you.\nAll the above require appropriate use of the MSM/PSL routines.\nYou will need to recognize and identity the different types of road junction and be able to negotiate them safely and without holding up other road users unnecessarily.\nYou will need to have a full understanding of the rules which apply to approaching and negotiating roundabouts. You will need to demonstrate that you can use them safely and confidently.You will need to know the different procedures needed to negotiate standard and mini roundabouts.\nWhen dealing with any roundabout you must:\n- Show effective use of the MSM and PSL routines\n- position your car correctly\n- use the correct lane on your approach and when on the roundabout\n- use the correct procedure on your exit from the roundabout\nYou will need to know the rules which apply to all pedestrian crossings and you will need to understand the differences between each type of crossing.\nYou will need to be able to safely negotiate all types of crossings and show:\n- effective observation\n- an ability to recognise different types of crossing\n- use of the correct speed when approaching a crossing\n- an understanding of how different weather conditions affect your ability to see and stop safely\n- a knowledge of when you need to stop for pedestrians who are using the crossing\nYou must be able to drive safely and with confidence all all types of dual carriageway.\nYou must demonstrate you understand the rules and procedures of joining, using and leaving a dual carriageway.\nYou must be able to perform all the manoeuvres safely and under control. They include:\n- turn in the road (three point turn)\n- bay parking\n- parallel parking\n- reversing round a corner\nGood clutch control is a key component of perform these manoeuvres correctly.\nYou must be able to perform an emergency stop safely and under control.\nTo safely stop your car as quickly as possible while keeping for control you need to know\nYou will need to demonstrate that you:\n- can co-ordinate the brake and clutch pedals so the car comes to stop under full control\n- know weather or not your car has ABS\n- know how different road and weather conditions can affect the way you stop\n- can control a skid if one occurs\n- know how to move away safely from an emergency stop\nYou will need to understand how some weather conditions will affect driving conditions. The primary affects will be on your:\n- stopping distance\nYou will need to know\n- the warning signs and signals that may need to be used\n- when to use your lights and which lights to use in poor visibility\n- how to avoids skidding and aquaplaning and what to do if they do occur","Transport and Main Roads have Guidelines for Masters operating superyachts in the Southport Pilotage area. The aims of the Guidelines are to assist superyacht (private recreational ships with a length of more than 24m) Masters to prepare for a visit to the Gold Coast and provide a reference document during their visit. We’ve summarised the Guidelines in this article to give you a quick overview. Download the Guidelines for full details.\nSuperyachts are free to enter and move around the Southport Pilotage Area as long as:\n- the Guidelines are followed\n- you are aware of all restrictions (outlined in the guidelines)\n- you familiarise yourself with the latest navigation warnings, shipping movements and weather information\n- you are compliant with the Convention on the International Regulations for Prevention of Collision at Sea 1972 (COLREGS), and\n- you maintain a listening watch on VHF Ch16 and follow all directions issued by Maritime Safety Queensland (MSQ).\nIf your ship is more that 50m in length you will need to use the services of a pilot, unless your Master holds a valid Pilotage Exemption Certificate for the pilotage area. Of course if you have any doubt regarding your ability to safely manoeuvre within the pilotage area you are encouraged to seek the services of a pilot.\nMaximum ship sizes\nA minimum under keel clearance (UKC) of 1.0 metre is required in the Gold Coast Seaway Entrance. A minimum UKC of 0.5 metres is required in all other areas of the Southport Broadwater.\nThe Seaway to Southport Yacht Club allows a maximum length of 65m and maximum draught of 3m, while the Seaway to Marine Precinct, Coomera allows a maximum length of 60m and a maximum draught of 2.1m.\nRecreational activities, helicopters and seaplanes\nThe Southport Broadwater is an extremely busy area for recreational activities, particularly on weekends, so care is required in navigating the area. Particularly watch out for surfers paddling across the Seaway. Helicopters are permitted and seaplanes use the area. See the guidelines for areas seaplanes use.\nExtreme weather contingency plans\nAll marinas have their own contingency plans and in extreme weather conditions, the Regional Director (Gold Coast), or others as delegated, may give directions in relation to ships in the Southport area which you must comply with immediately. There is a list of general preventative measures to take in case of extreme weather.\nNo dangerous goods can be brought into or handled in the pilotage area until notification is provided to the MSQ Gold Coast Office (see the list of dangers that dangerous goods may present).\nCustoms and quarantine\nForeign boats must first clear customs and quarantine in Brisbane or other nominated Australian port.\nBoat licenses and certificates of competency\nIn Queensland, a marine license is required to operate a recreational boat, which is powered by a motor greater than 4.5 kW (over 6 HP) and additionally you must have a personal watercraft (PWC) license to operate a personal watercraft. From January 2013, new recreational boat license applicants wanting to operate a boat 12 metres or more will need to obtain an advanced recreational marine driver licence endorsement.\nLegislation requires all ships over 15m in length to have insurance sufficient to pay for potential pollution clean up, salvage and wreck removal. See the list of requirements that the insurance policy must meet.\nYour tender doesn’t need to be registered, but it must be marked on the exterior with the word ‘tender’ and the primary ship registration numbers, at least 75 mm high.\nA deep anchorage is available for transient ships east of the South Channel between beacons S6 and S8. A seven-day anchoring limit applies to all ships in this area.\nAll Gold Coast waterways are subject to anchoring and mooring restrictions. Information can be sought from the office of MSQ, Gold Coast.\nBerthing and ship facilities\n- Southport has four main marinas where you can berth ships up to 65m in length: Southport Yacht Club (up to 55m);\n- Mariners Cove (up to 30m);\n- Marina Mirage (up to 65m) and\n- Palazzo Versace (up to 32m).\nSee the guidelines for berth depths.\nThe Gold Coast City Marina and Shipyard at Coomera can accommodate super yachts seeking refits, blasting, paintwork and new builds. Masters should check proposed marina berth design loadings. Direct access to water is available via the 150 tonne travel lift. Berthing of ships up to 50 metres in length can be achieved and the depth of water at the marina is 3.5 metres lowest astronomical tide.\nBridges across waterways\nThere are three bridges in the vicinity of the Southport Broadwater:\n- Sovereign Islands Bridge (5m clearance at highest astronomical tide);\n- Ephraim Island Bridge (5.9m clearance at highest astronomical tide), and\n- The Gold Coast Bridge (4.5m clearance at highest astronomical tide).\nYou must keep your speed to a limit where the ship’s wash doesn’t cause a marine incident or damage to the shoreline.\n- The Coomera River has a speed limit of 6 knots for ships 8m and over in length.\n- The South Channel has a speed limit of 6 knots commencing immediately north of beacons S11 and S12, south to the Gold Coast Bridge.\n- The Southport Broadwater and North Channels have a 40 knot limit; however, because of the need to limit your wash you are required to limit your ship to maneuvering speeds only. As a general principle, ships over 20m LOA should travel at speeds up to 10 knots within smooth water limits, where the speed limit is set at 40 knots.\nDischarges of oil, noxious liquid substances, sewage and garbage from ships are prohibited in Queensland coastal waters and pilotage areas. It is an offence to discharge untreated or treated sewage in certain areas throughout the Southport Pilotage Area. Refer to the Gold Coast office of MSQ or the links in the guidelines for guidance. Pump out facilities are listed in Table 1 of the guidelines.\nOil and chemical pollutants\nClean bilges help reduce pollution. Use absorbents to mop up excess oil or fuel, wash your bilge with biodegradable degreasers or detergents and dispose of any cleaning residue ashore.\nIf oil does spill into the water, use absorbents to mop it up and let the Harbour Master, marina manager or port authority know so that it can be cleaned up as soon as possible. Do not use dispersants or other cleaning chemicals because they can increase the toxic effects of oil spills.\nThe Master of your ship must report a discharge, or probable discharge, without delay by contacting MSQ. Ships without telephones can call the Gold Coast Seaway Tower and ask their report to be passed to MSQ.\nIf you are involved in any of the marine incidents listed in the guidelines (involving two or more ships) your ship’s master must assist the other ship/s and people and stay at the scene until no more assistance is needed and provide your details to all the other ship’s masters involved.\nMarine incidents must be reported to a Shipping Inspector within 48 hours of the incident occurring.\nProtected animals and habitat\nThe Moreton Bay Marine Park is situated to the north of the Gold Coast Seaway. The habitats found in the marine park support a diversity of marine fauna and flora including more than 1,000 species of fish that share the waters with six of the world’s seven species of marine turtles and several threatened species such as grey nurse sharks and dugong. The marine park is also important for other marine mammals such as humpback whales and dolphins. See the guidelines for full details of time limits, permits, anchoring, speeds and special care around wildlife, particularly shorebirds and whales.\n- See page 21 of the guidelines for a full list of emergency contacts.\n- Shipping Inspectors are MSQ Marine Officers, officers of Queensland Water Police and Queensland Boating and Fisheries Patrol.\n- MSQ Gold Coast office by phone on +61 7 5539 7300 or after hours on +61 4 0775 2884 (0407 752 884 using Australian telephone networks).\n- Gold Coast Seaway Tower on VHF channels 16 or 73.\n- Australian Maritime Safety Authority website\n- Beacon to Beacon Directory provides a comprehensive guide to Gold Coast waterways.\n- Bureau of Meteorology (BOM)\n- Maritime Safety Queensland (MSQ) publishes Queensland Notices to Mariners on an as needed basis to warn ship operators of navigation hazards, faulty aids to navigation and or changes to aids to navigation, flare demonstrations, change of channel depths and any other relevant information.\n- MB6 Nerang River to Couran chart\n- Moreton Bay Marine Park\n- MSQ shipping officers\n- Port Procedures and Information for Shipping – Southport Pilotage Area manual\n- Tropical Cyclone Warning Centre"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:67c4f5f7-b7e2-4f50-99dc-f12056ca8889>","<urn:uuid:d05f2b2f-00e2-4f71-a12f-da30ab80a346>"],"error":null}

{"question":"I need to understand the role of partnerships in IT asset management. How does ITIL approach supplier relationships in asset management, and what successful partnerships exist in IT equipment recycling?","answer":"ITIL's Four Dimensions Model emphasizes the importance of partners and suppliers in IT asset management, where asset managers are responsible for building strong relationships with suppliers who provide IT assets. Suppliers must provide detailed asset information, and asset managers work with procurement teams to handle license renewals and hardware requests. In the recycling sphere, successful partnerships have emerged between governments, businesses, and NGOs. For example, the Green Electronics Council's EPEAT program demonstrates effective collaboration by certifying environmentally-responsible products and encouraging manufacturers to partner with certified recyclers. Similarly, companies like Apple and Dell have established partnerships through their recycling programs, working with various stakeholders to ensure responsible e-waste management and promote circular economy principles.","context":["Developed in the 1980s by the UK Government, the IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) is an all-encompassing framework that details the most important IT practices. It is designed around the concept of providing value and focuses on the idea that IT systems must be used to offer a tangible benefit to businesses.\nITIL consists of a nested structure that makes it easy to place specific practices within the wider framework, ITAM being one of them.\nThere are four ITIL systems that contain ITAM:\n1. Service Value System (SVS)\nThe SVS describes how each element in an IT environment participates in the creation of value. At a high level, SVS works like a basic mathematics function made up of three elements:\n2. ITIL General Management Practices\nManagement practices are a set of organizational resources. They are designed for performing work or accomplishing an objective. This provides a framework that permeates the whole IT function. These provide clear roles and responsibilities for workers and teams with business management domains, including Portfolio management, Project management, Relationship management, and Risk management.\n3.

The best way for each of those practices to be implemented is by assigning roles. Within a service management team, you will find: Capacity and performance management, Change control, Incident management, IT asset management, and Problem management.\n4. IT Asset Management\nA sub-practice of asset management, ITAM is aimed at managing the lifecycle and costs of IT assets. As such, ITAM is key for IT departments to deliver valuable services.\nA lot of other practices depend on the information provided by IT asset management, including:\n- Change management\n- Problem and incident management\n- Configuration management\nITAM is responsible for managing software, hardware, networking, cloud services, and client devices. In some cases, it may also include non-IT assets such as buildings and security devices.\nEither way, ITAM must include all types of IT assets:\n- Hardware Assets: These need to be labeled and tracked to protect against theft or damage.\n- Software Assets: These revolve around licensing and ensuring contractual compliance. For example, when equipment is decommissioned, licenses may remain unused. Retrieving those back and reassigning them ensures efficient license usage.\n- Cloud-based assets: In addition to usage and licensing, these must be managed so that organizations are flexible to invoke new instances of cloud use when needed.\n- Contractual arrangements: These must be understood and adhered to, in the same way as for software licenses.\n- Client assets: These must be assigned to individuals who take responsibility for their care.\nIn case of vendor audits, asset management is crucial. Software licensing is a part of normal ITAM activity and is crucial to ensure compliance. In addition, software runs on hardware, so the management of hardware assets must be included. Cloud-based assets are the newest area that ITAM must focus on. The different licensing models and demand-based services require adequate management.\nITAM and the Four Dimensions Model\nITIL defined the ‘Four Dimensions Model’ of ITAM to offer a holistic approach to efficient services. These dimensions are:\n1. Organizations and people\nITIL suggests that individuals or groups of practices are managed by dedicated resources. This means having asset managers responsible for:\n- Visibility over the lifecycle of IT assets\n- Updating asset registers\n- Highlighting issues and concerns regarding compliance\n- Optimizing the IT estate from a cost perspective\n2. Information and technology\nGood ITAM practices heavily rely on technology. As systems are getting more complex with time, manual tracking does not enable optimization. Thankfully, many Software Asset Management and Hardware Asset Management tools are available to offer visibility.\nFunctionality for ITAM tools include:\n- License optimization\n- Vendor-Specific License Management\n- Automated Reporting\n- Workflow-defined lifecycle processes\n3. Partners and suppliers\nMost IT assets are going to be provided by suppliers and vendors. Therefore, asset managers are responsible for creating good relationships. Every time an asset is brought in, the suppliers need to provide details for the asset. It is then the asset manager's duty to store those accurately.\nLikewise, asset managers can submit requests for new assets. Working with procurement teams, they can contact suppliers to renew licenses and hardware.\n4. Value streams and processes\nAs mentioned, ITAM is a part of Service Management. To ensure that value is provided, all parts of service management must work together, which means that asset managers have an active role in the service management team. They would need to interact with service, deployment, incident, problem, change managers to achieve a common goal.","E-waste: An Environmental Challenge\nAs technology continues to evolve at a rapid pace, the global problem of electronic waste, or e-waste, presents a growing concern. E-waste refers to the discarded electrical and electronic devices that have reached the end of their useful lives. These items, which include computers, smartphones, and other IT equipment, often contain hazardous materials that can pose significant risks to human health and the environment if not handled properly.\nE-waste recycling is a critical step in mitigating these risks and reducing environmental impact. By safely recovering valuable materials and properly disposing of hazardous substances, IT equipment recycling initiatives can contribute to a more sustainable future.\nThe Power of Collaboration: Best Practices in IT Equipment Recycling\nOne of the keys to successfully tackling the e-waste challenge lies in collaboration. Through partnerships between governments, businesses, and NGOs, a variety of innovative IT equipment recycling initiatives have emerged. These initiatives demonstrate the power of collaboration and showcase best practices for effective e-waste management.\nCase Study 1: Green Electronics Council’s EPEAT Program\nThe Green Electronics Council’s Electronic Product Environmental Assessment Tool (EPEAT) program is a leading example of a successful IT equipment recycling initiative. EPEAT provides a transparent and objective measure of a product’s environmental performance, including its recyclability. By certifying products that meet specific environmental criteria, EPEAT incentivizes manufacturers to design devices with end-of-life recycling in mind.\nThe EPEAT program also promotes recycling infrastructure development by encouraging manufacturers to partner with certified recyclers. This collaboration ensures that discarded IT equipment is handled responsibly, promoting circular economy principles and minimizing the environmental impact of e-waste.\nCase Study 2: Apple’s Recycling Program\nApple’s recycling program is another notable example of a successful IT equipment recycling initiative. The company has implemented a comprehensive approach to e-waste management, with a focus on maximizing resource recovery and minimizing waste. By offering free in-store and mail-in recycling options, Apple makes it convenient for customers to dispose of their old devices responsibly.\nApple’s recycling program also incorporates innovative recycling technologies, such as the use of robots to disassemble devices and recover valuable materials. Through their commitment to e-waste recycling, Apple demonstrates the importance of taking full responsibility for the entire lifecycle of their products.\nCase Study 3: Dell’s Closed-Loop Recycling Process\nDell has established a closed-loop recycling process that exemplifies their commitment to sustainability. Through their closed-loop approach, Dell aims to reduce waste, conserve resources, and promote a circular economy. The company sources materials from recycled IT equipment and incorporates them into the manufacturing of new products, thus reducing the demand for virgin materials.\nIn addition to their closed-loop recycling process, Dell has implemented a take-back program that allows customers to return their old IT equipment for proper recycling. By creating a convenient and accessible recycling solution, Dell ensures that end-of-life devices are handled responsibly and contribute to the creation of a more sustainable future.\nThe case studies of successful IT equipment recycling initiatives demonstrate the power of collaboration and innovation in addressing the challenges posed by e-waste. Through partnerships, certifications, comprehensive recycling programs, and closed-loop processes, these initiatives contribute to a more sustainable future by minimizing waste and conserving valuable resources. As technology continues to advance, it is essential to prioritize responsible e-waste management to protect the environment and promote a circular economy.

{"question":"As someone studying ancient concepts of morality, what similarities exist between Vidura's teachings about heaven and hell and the divine-demoniacal division in yoga philosophy?","answer":"Both teachings emphasize that there are two contrasting paths or states of being. Vidura's teaching shows that heaven and hell are different for different people based on their position and circumstances - for a laborer heaven might be a good meal, while for spiritual seekers it's divine communion. Similarly, the yoga philosophy divides human nature into divine and demoniacal qualities, where divine qualities lead to liberation and demoniacal qualities lead to bondage. In both cases, there is a clear preference - just as everyone desires heaven over hell, the texts encourage cultivating divine qualities (like purity, truth, and good conduct) over demoniacal ones (like arrogance, lust, and ignorance).","context":["In the previous episode we had witnessed yet another important point that Vidura has emphasized as part of his advice to King Dhirdiraashtra. He is currently talking about “fear” and what are those aspects for which different categories of people fear for. He says that poor people have a constant fear within themselves whether they would be able to obtain three meals a day so as to sustain their living. This is because of their low-income levels and they would always keep a check on how much money they are earning on that particular day. This is what keeps them on their toes so as to make both ends of their life meet. If we’ve to talk of the majority people like us who constitute the middle and upper-middle segment of the society, we constantly fear death! Why is that so? It is because of various tensions, pressure situations that we undergo every day in life along with the resultant diseases and side-effects that might occur. This always haunts us constantly and eventually we keep thinking about our family, children, property, etc. post our death. Thus, somewhere at the back of our mind, Vidura says, that we fear about death in some way or the other! Now talking of the rich and the upper class people, they fear their personal brand reputation a lot. The richness here according to Vidura is not only with respect to money and property. The richness can also be with respect to character, art, education, etc. For instance, if a person is an established musician and is performing various concerts worldwide, he/she might have built a huge fan following and a big brand reputation. For whatsoever reason, all of a sudden this brand reputation might collapse any day! This is what makes them extremely careful and cautious while dealing with their public life. We can witness various examples like musicians, actors, actresses, politicians, leading industrialists, eminent personalities in sports, etc. Even today we can see how these people carefully manage their brand reputation amidst the public forum and this is exactly what Vidura has conveyed 5000 years ago! Thus from all the above examples and descriptions, we come to know that all of us are in some form of a fear every passing minute and every passing day, with respect to our respective categories that we belong to.\nExtending this discussion forward, today we shall witness what is “Hell” and what is “Heaven”. Velukkudi Shri Krishnan Swamy in one of his discourses brings this out beautifully. He poses an interesting question thus: What is “Heaven” and what is “Hell”? Can “Heaven” and “Hell” be the same for everybody in this world? Let us check it out with a few examples again.\nFor instance if we ask this question to a daily-wage worker who is on the road everytime pulling a heavy cart full of load, what would be the answer? That person would obviously say that if he/she gets a sumptuous breakfast/lunch/dinner for that day after a heavy load of work that would feel like “Heaven”! If on that contrary, it becomes “Hell”! Whereas if we’ve to ask musicians and people who render spiritual discourses the same question, what would be the answer? They would say that if their throat were intact during the auspicious Tamil month of “Margazhi” (Falls somewhere from mid December to mid January every year) it would be “Heaven” for them! If their throat develops problems with cough and cold during this particular peak season, it becomes a “Hell” as all their concert schedules are thrown off haywire! Whereas if we ask the great “Alwars” and “Aachaaryas” the same question, they would say that if they get to see Bhagawan daily and have His darshan, it would always be “Heaven” for them.\nThus from all these examples we see here that “Heaven” and “Hell” might be different for different people. However we need to note here that ultimately everybody wants “Heaven” and do not want “Hell”.\nThis concept is beautifully brought about in the Valmiki Ramayana too. We’ve of course discussed this in one of the episodes during our Ramayana project earlier – When Lord Rama is about to go to the forest, he tries to convince Sita not to accompany him. Rather, he advises her to be in Ayodhya to take care of his parents, Bharata and Shathrughna. But Sita refuses! She is adamant that she would somehow accompany Rama irrespective of whatever difficulty she faces in the forest for the next fourteen years. Lord Rama tries his best to convince her to stay back, but in vain! Sita sticks to her stance! Finally Sita asks Lord Rama this same question: She asks thus, “Oh Rama! Please answer this one question for me and thereafter you might do whatever you wish to! What is “Heaven” and “Hell”? Please do not give me any bluff answer and straightaway come to the point!”\n“Yastvayaa sahasassvargaha nirayo yastvayaa vinaa!\nIthijaanan paraam preetim gaccha raamamayaasaha!!”\nThrough this sloka, Sita expresses herself with tears in her eyes, “Oh Rama! Do you know what is “Heaven” and “Hell” for me? If I’m with you always, it is “Heaven” for me! Whereas if you are away from me it is “Hell” for me! This is all what I know about “Hell” and “Heaven”! You are telling me that I can be happy and comfortable if I’m here in Ayodhya. But do you think I can be happy even for a moment when you’re not with me? You are telling me that I would face lot of difficulties and hardships when I come to the forest with you. But let me tell you one thing! Oh Rama! If you are near me, what kind of difficulties am I going to face? So please do not stop me from coming with you to the forest for fourteen years! I shall be with you every minute and make sure that you would be happy and contended! So Rama, come let us go!”\nThus the message from this important episode is that, “Heaven” and “Hell” are different for different people, according to their stature, position, etc. However one thing is constant – Everybody likes to experience “Heaven” and dislikes to experience “Hell”. So for today let us ponder over this important point and decide which is “Heaven” and “Hell” for each of us individually! We shall wait till the next episode to witness more of Vidura’s explanation! Stay tuned! 🙂","XVI: The Yoga of the Division Between the Divine and the Demoniacal\nSummary of Sixteenth Discourse\nThis discourse is important and very instructive to all persons who wish to attain happiness, prosperity and blessedness, and to seekers in particular, who wish to attain success in their spiritual life. Lord Krishna brings out quite clearly and unmistakably here the intimate connection between ethics and spirituality, between a life of virtue and God-realisation and liberation. Listing two sets of qualities of opposite kinds, the Lord classifies them as divine and demoniacal (undivine), and urges us to eradicate the latter and cultivate the divine qualities.\nWhat kind of nature should one develop? What conduct must one follow? What way should one live and act if one must attain God and obtain divine bliss? These questions are answered with perfect clarity and very definitely. The pure divine qualities are conducive to peace and liberation and the undivine qualities lead to bondage. Purity, good conduct and truth are indispensable to spiritual progress and even to an honourable life here.\nDevoid of purity, good conduct and truth, and having no faith in God or a higher Reality beyond this visible world, man degenerates into a two-legged beast of ugly character and cruel actions, and sinks into darkness. Such a person becomes his own enemy and the destroyer of the happiness of others as well as his own. Caught in countless desires and cravings, a slave of sensual enjoyments and beset by a thousand cares, his life ultimately ends in misery and degradation. Haughtiness, arrogance and egoism lead to this dire fate. Therefore, a wise person, desiring success, must eradicate vice and cultivate virtue.\nIn this world three gates lead to hell—the gates of passion, anger and greed. Released from these three qualities one can succeed in attaining salvation and reaching the highest goal, namely God. Thus the sacred scriptures teach wisely the right path of pure, virtuous living. One should therefore follow the injunctions of the sacred scriptures that wish his welfare and be guided in his actions by their noble teachings.\nSri Bhagavaan Uvaacha:Abhayam sattwasamshuddhih jnaanayogavyavasthitih;\nDaanam damashcha yajnashcha swaadhyaayastapa aarjavam.\nThe Blessed Lord said:\n1. Fearlessness, purity of heart, steadfastness in Yoga and knowledge, alms-giving, control of the senses, sacrifice, study of scriptures, austerity and straightforwardness,Ahimsaa satyamakrodhas tyaagah shaantirapaishunam;\nDayaa bhooteshvaloluptwam maardavam hreerachaapalam.\n2. Harmlessness, truth, absence of anger, renunciation, peacefulness, absence of crookedness, compassion towards beings, uncovetousness, gentleness, modesty, absence of fickleness,Tejah kshamaa dhritih shauchamadroho naatimaanitaa;\nBhavanti sampadam daiveem abhijaatasya bhaarata.\n3. Vigour, forgiveness, fortitude, purity, absence of hatred, absence of pride—these belong to one born in a divine state, O Arjuna!Dambho darpo’bhimaanashcha krodhah paarushyameva cha;\nAjnaanam chaabhijaatasya paartha sampadamaasureem.\n4. Hypocrisy, arrogance, self-conceit, harshness and also anger and ignorance, belong to one who is born in a demoniacal state, O Arjuna!Daivee sampadvimokshaaya nibandhaayaasuree mataa;\nMaa shuchah sampadam daiveem abhijaato’si paandava.\n5. The divine nature is deemed for liberation and the demoniacal for bondage. Grieve not, O Arjuna, for thou art born with divine properties!\nCOMMENTARY: As Arjuna is dejected, Sri Krishna assures him not to feel alarmed at this description of the demoniacal qualities as he is born with Sattwic tendencies leading towards salvation.Dwau bhootasargau loke’smin daiva aasura eva cha;\nDaivo vistarashah proktah aasuram paartha me shrinu.\n6. There are two types of beings in this world—the divine and the demoniacal; the divine has been described at length; hear from Me, O Arjuna, of the demoniacal!Pravrittim cha nivrittim cha janaa na viduraasuraah;\nNa shaucham naapi chaachaaro na satyam teshu vidyate.\n7. The demoniacal know not what to do and what to refrain from; neither purity nor right conduct nor truth is found in them.Asatyamapratishtham te jagadaahuraneeshwaram;\nAparasparasambhootam kimanyat kaamahaitukam.\n8. They say: “This universe is without truth, without a (moral) basis, without a God, brought about by mutual union, with lust for its cause; what else?”Etaam drishtimavashtabhya nashtaatmaano’lpabuddhayah;\nPrabhavantyugrakarmaanah kshayaaya jagato’hitaah.\n9. Holding this view, these ruined souls of small intellects and fierce deeds, come forth as enemies of the world for its destruction.Kaamamaashritya dushpooram dambhamaanamadaanvitaah;\n10. Filled with insatiable desires, full of hypocrisy, pride and arrogance, holding evil ideas through delusion, they work with impure resolves.Chintaamaparimeyaam cha pralayaantaamupaashritaah;\nKaamopabhogaparamaa etaavaditi nishchitaah.\n11. Giving themselves over to immeasurable cares ending only with death, regarding gratification of lust as their highest aim, and feeling sure that that is all,Aashaapaashashatairbaddhaah kaamakrodhaparaayanaah;\nEehante kaamabhogaartha manyaayenaarthasanchayaan.\n12. Bound by a hundred ties of hope, given over to lust and anger, they strive to obtain by unlawful means hoards of wealth for sensual enjoyment.Idamadya mayaa labdham imam praapsye manoratham;\nIdamasteedamapi me bhavishyati punardhanam.\n13. “This has been gained by me today; this desire I shall obtain; this is mine and this wealth too shall be mine in future.”Asau mayaa hatah shatrur hanishye chaaparaanapi;\nEeshwaro’hamaham bhogee siddho’ham balavaan sukhee.\n14. “That enemy has been slain by me and others also I shall slay. I am the lord; I enjoy; I am perfect, powerful and happy”.Aadhyo’bhijanavaanasmi ko’nyosti sadrisho mayaa;\nYakshye daasyaami modishye ityajnaanavimohitaah.\n15. “I am rich and born in a noble family. Who else is equal to me? I will sacrifice. I will give (charity). I will rejoice,”—thus, deluded by ignorance,Anekachittavibhraantaah mohajaalasamaavritaah;\nPrasaktaah kaamabhogeshu patanti narake’shuchau.\n16. Bewildered by many a fancy, entangled in the snare of delusion, addicted to the gratification of lust, they fall into a foul hell.Aatmasambhaavitaah stabdhaa dhanamaanamadaanvitaah;\nYajante naamayajnaiste dambhenaavidhipoorvakam.\n17. Self-conceited, stubborn, filled with the intoxication and pride of wealth, they perform sacrifices in name, through ostentation, contrary to scriptural ordinances.Ahankaaram balam darpam kaamam krodham cha samshritaah;\n18. Given over to egoism, power, haughtiness, lust and anger, these malicious people hate Me in their own bodies and those of others.Taanaham dwishatah krooraan samsaareshu naraadhamaan;\nKshipaamyajasram ashubhaan aasureeshweva yonishu.\n19. These cruel haters, the worst among men in the world,—I hurl all these evil-doers for ever into the wombs of demons only.Aasureem yonimaapannaa moodhaa janmani janmani;\nMaamapraapyaiva kaunteya tato yaantyadhamaam gatim.\n20. Entering into demoniacal wombs and deluded birth after birth, not attaining Me, they thus fall, O Arjuna, into a condition still lower than that!Trividham narakasyedam dwaaram naashanamaatmanah;\nKaamah krodhastathaa lobhas tasmaadetat trayam tyajet.\n21. Triple is the gate of this hell, destructive of the self—lust, anger, and greed,—therefore, one should abandon these three.Etairvimuktah kaunteya tamodwaaraistribhirnarah;\nAacharatyaatmanah shreyas tato yaati paraam gatim.\n22. A man who is liberated from these three gates to darkness, O Arjuna, practises what is good for him and thus goes to the Supreme goal!\nCOMMENTARY: When these three gates to hell are abandoned, the path to salvation is cleared for the aspirant. He gets the company of sages, which leads to liberation. He receives spiritual instructions and practises them. He hears the scriptures, reflects, meditates and attains Self-realisation.Yah shaastravidhimutsrijya vartate kaamakaaratah;\nNa sa siddhimavaapnoti na sukham na paraam gatim.\n23. He who, casting aside the ordinances of the scriptures, acts under the impulse of desire, attains neither perfection nor happiness nor the supreme goal.Tasmaat shaastram pramaanam te kaaryaakaaryavyavasthitau;\nJnaatwaa shaastravidhaanoktam karma kartumihaarhasi.\n24. Therefore, let the scripture be the authority in determining what ought to be done and what ought not to be done. Having known what is said in the ordinance of the scriptures, thou shouldst act here in this world.\nHari Om Tat Sat\nIti Srimad Bhagavadgeetaasoopanishatsu Brahmavidyaayaam\nYogashaastre Sri Krishnaarjunasamvaade\nDaivaasurasampadvibhaagayogo Naama Shodasho’dhyaayah\nThus in the Upanishads of the glorious Bhagavad Gita, the science of the Eternal, the scripture of Yoga, the dialogue between Sri Krishna and Arjuna, ends the sixteenth discourse entitled:\n“The Yoga of the Division Between the Divine & the Demoniacal”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:592aa61f-d6d7-495a-9810-0ae9a8ccc9b3>","<urn:uuid:6c1b157d-6e4d-44c1-b00e-ba18bd2ce86d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the essential features of running shoes for injury prevention, and what medical conditions can result from inadequate footwear support?","answer":"Running shoes have three main components crucial for injury prevention: the midsole for cushioning and shock absorption, the outsole for traction and durability, and the upper for support and breathability. The right support based on pronation type (neutral, stability, or motion control) is essential to prevent discomfort. However, inadequate footwear support can lead to several medical conditions, including ankle sprains, which affect nearly two million people annually in the US. Poor shoe support can also contribute to chronic ankle instability, where the ankle feels unstable and prone to giving out, especially after multiple sprains. Additionally, inappropriate footwear can increase the risk of stress fractures, which are tiny cracks in bones caused by overuse, and Plantar Fasciitis, where the tissue running from the front of the foot to the heel becomes damaged.","context":["How to Pick Running Shoes\nWhether you prefer to log your miles on the pavement, trail, or on the treadmill, running takes a lot of hard work, perseverance, and dedication. Casual runners and marathoners alike know that quality running shoes make all the difference when it comes to reaching your goals. Since no two runners are alike, finding a comfortable pair of running shoes that offers the proper support for your body can be a bit of a challenge. Our Footwear Experts share the basics for how to pick running shoes.\nParts of A Running Shoe\nThere are three main parts of a running shoe: midsole, outsole, and upper. Combined, they impact the type of support, energy return, and cushioning you’ll feel while running.\nWhat is a Midsole?\nThe midsole is the middle part of the running shoe that cushions your feet and absorbs some of the shock from the heel strike. The midsole is also where the support and alignment features are located.\nWhat is an Outsole?\nThe outsole is the portion of the shoe that comes in contact with the ground’s surface. Most running shoes feature a rubber outsole to provide both traction and durability.\nWhat is an Upper?\nThe upper is the portion of the running shoe above the bottom sole, and it’s usually made with multiple layers of mesh to provide the support and stretch you need. A mesh upper also allows your feet to breathe during long, warm runs.\nTypes of Running Shoes\nThere are three main types of running shoes: road running shoes, trail running shoes, and cross training shoes. To narrow down which type of running shoes you need, ask yourself two questions:\n- What surface will I be doing most of my running on?\n- What will be the average distance of my runs?\nKnowing the answers to these two questions will help you determine the best type of running shoes to buy.\n1. Road-Running Shoes\n- Ideal for pavement or treadmill running\n- Lightweight upper\n- Flexible outsoles\nRoad running shoes are the most common and versatile option and are best if you’re planning to run long distances either outside on a sidewalk or indoors on a track or treadmill. With lightweight uppers and flexible outsoles, you’ll enjoy stability and cushion, while the materials offer durability for frequent use. Are you training for a city 5k, 10k, half marathon, or marathon? Road running shoes are the type you’ll want to wear throughout training and during the race.\n2. Trail-Running Shoes\n- Ideal for trail running\n- Durable upper for protection\n- Lugged outsole for traction\nTrail running shoes are built for uneven and unpredictable surface conditions. With bigger lugs on the outsole, trail running shoes are able to grip the terrain better than road running shoes. The uppers are typically constructed from stiffer and more durable materials compared to road running shoes in order to protect your feet from rocks or other hazards. If you’re planning on running at a national or state park, you’ll want to make sure to wear trail running shoes for the right support and stability.\n3. Cross-Training Shoes\n- Ideal for gym workouts\n- Good for short distance running\n- Multipurpose outsole for reliable grip\nCross training shoes feature a sturdy design and multipurpose outsoles for versatility while working out. Cross training shoes can be worn on the treadmill, but only for short distances up to a couple miles. This type of shoe is perfect for people who do some running while working out but also spend time lifting weights or playing sports.\nTypes of Running Shoe Support\nAside from the type of running shoes, you need to have the proper support to avoid discomfort during and after your run. The type of support needed is based on how you pronate.\nWhat is pronation?\nThe way your foot strikes the ground when you run is known as pronation. Some runners overpronate meaning they run more on the interior of their feet. Other runners supinate meaning they run more on the outer edges of their feet. Knowing how you pronate will help you determine what type of support you need: neutral, stability, and motion control.\nTo find out what type of support you need, look at the outsole on a worn pair of shoes and pay attention to the wear:\n- Even wear on the heel and near the forefoot means you most likely overpronate and need stability running shoes.\n- More wear around the outer edges means you most likely supinate and need neutral running shoes.\n- Even wear on the outsole means you have neutral pronation and need neutral running shoes.\n- Significant wear on the inner parts of your shoes means you most likely heavily overpronate and need motion-control shoes.\nMost runners fall into needing a pair of stability or neutral running shoes. Our Footwear Experts share more about the difference between the two types of support in our Neutral vs. Stability Running Shoes Guide.\nCushioning in Your Running Shoes\nWhen it comes to cushioning in your running shoes, it really depends on personal preference. The more cushion within your running shoes the softer the landing, while minimal cushion provides a greater connection between the runner and the pavement. How much cushion a running shoe has can be indicated by the heel to toe drop.\nWhat is Heel to Toe Drop?\nWhen looking at running shoes, you’ll notice the term heel to toe drop or offset. Heel to toe drop is the difference between the amount of cushion in the heel and forefoot of the running shoe. Low heel to toe drops are typically 4-8mm and are designed for runners who prefer to land on their midfoot or forefoot. High heel to toe drops are usually 10-12mm and are designed for runners who prefer to land on their heel.\nHow Long to Break in Running Shoes?\nNew runners need to be aware that it takes between 2 to 3 weeks for your running shoes to be properly broken in. If you have properly fitting running shoes, they should feel rather comfortable from the start, but it's a good idea to wear them around the house or out on a few shorter runs (2-3 miles) before wearing them during a race or on longer runs (4+ miles).\nLearning how to pick running shoes is important to help prevent running-related injuries and pain. With the proper type of running shoe and support, you’ll stay motivated and on track to reaching your running goals. If you have any questions or need additional help finding the right pair of running shoes, contact a Footwear Expert at your local SCHEELS.","Ankle sprains are the most common sports related injuries among athletes. According to statistics, nearly two million ankle sprain injuries are reported every year in the United States. When an athlete experiences an ankle injury, he is put to bed for several weeks and is suggested to refrain from games during this entire time frame.\nThis kind of break can be excruciating for someone who lives to play. Many athletes have known to suffer major trauma because of these injuries and not because they get hurt, but because they lose major opportunities that come their way while they are on bed rest.\nSeeing this, the concept of ankle wrapping was introduced more than 60 years ago. This was a practical method for decreasing the pain and number of injuries caused during extreme sports and training exercises. As the time went by, ankle wrapping turned into the manufacturing of professional ankle braces that have now made life easier of all the runners and athletes.\nWhat is an ankle brace?\nAn ankle brace is a medical piece of fabric that is wrapped around the ankle to immobilize the joint and provide heat and compression to the bones in order for it to heal. Ankle brace is more like a walking boot for sprained ankle. These are sturdy preventative measures that are suggested by all the physicians for anyone who is involved in running or impact sports.\nThere are different types of ankle braces available in the market for all kinds of sports. You will easily find football ankle braces, volleyball ankle braces, soccer ankle brace, athletic ankle brace and even ankle brace for running, as these sports are the most common ones to cause ankle injuries.\nThere are specific ankle braces available in the market that will cater to your needs regarding these sports while some are usually used for healing process.\nMost of these ankle braces are commonly used for rehabilitation purposes. Some ankle braces are made up of stretchable fabric while some are constructed with metallic plates for better immobilization in severe injuries.\nThere are several benefits of using ankle braces. They will effectively speed up your healing process and also prevent you from getting future injuries.\nConditions That Require The Use of Ankle Braces\nThere are mainly two reasons for using an ankle brace continuously, a knee injury or a high ankle sprain.\nAccording to the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Society, “a high ankle sprain is an injury to the ligaments above the ankle that connect the tibia to the fibula.”\nThis injury is usually caused by rotating or twisting of the foot while the ankle stays in one position and is unable to move freely. You end up tearing your high-ankle ligaments and this is where you need a high ankle sprain brace.\nThis was one medical condition while there are several others, some of them we have mentioned below.\nThe most common injury among athletes and even non-athletic people is an ankle sprain. It can occur just by walking and doesn’t really need you to indulge in impact sports.\nWhen ankle sprains happen, your foot goes into an unnatural movement and causes ligaments to stretch that result in inflammation and pain. The ligament damage can range from complete rupture to a small tear.\nYou will need a sprained ankle brace to heal from this injury. You may also require a complete bed rest for a few days as well.\nRunning athletes and basketball players are the most vulnerable to a condition known as Achilles Tendonitis. The Achilles tendon connects the calf muscles to the heel bone and is prone to rupture.\nThis tendon is basically used during running and jumping. When you play basketball for continuous and repetitive hours, it becomes vulnerable to injury and may become inflamed. You will need to use the best ankle brace for basketball in order to prevent this from happening.\nThis condition causes a lot of pain and may even cause you to leave your game for several weeks. You will also need to use a basketball knee brace as soon as you resume playing again for preventative reasons.\nChronic Ankle Instability\nChronic ankle instability is a condition that needs an active ankle brace. In this condition, the outer side of the ankle feels like it may give out and the ankle itself feels highly unstable.\nThis occurs when you have had several ankle sprains and they haven’t had enough time and support to heal completely. In this condition, you need the best ankle support braces that you can find and stay off your feet for a while.\nThis is a highly dangerous condition that may result in a broken ankle if it prolongs. Chronic ankle instability also occurs because of running on a sprained ankle without any support. So, if you feel you have just experienced an ankle sprain, it is highly recommended by the physician that you take your time to heal properly before getting back to your routine.\nOnce healed, find yourself the best ankle braces for running as a prevention from future ankle sprains.\nThe Plantar Fasciitis is another common condition among athletes. It occurs when the Plantar Fascia, a tissue that runs from the front of the foot to the heel, gets ruptured due to acute pressure and muscle stress.\nThe ruptured can be caused by an unnatural landing or quick cut on the court.\nMost of the people who suffer from this condition have this misunderstanding that using an ankle brace will decrease their performance however, that isn’t the case. If you wear an ankle brace properly and make use of specially designed shoes for Plantar Fasciitis, you can prevent re-injury and heal yourself without minimizing your movement.\nAnkle Stress Fractures\nAnkle stress fractures are known to be tiny cracks in the bones caused by overusing tired muscles. When a person is suffering from ankle stress fractures, his bones lose the capability to absorb shock from repetitive impacts.\nThe bones try to absorb the effects of the impact and that’s when you may feel pain, swelling and tenderness around your ankle. You can find the best ankle brace for sprain or you can even use ankle stabilizers to cope with this condition.\nAnkle stress fractures may last for a week or two during which you must take complete bed rest.\nSo, these are the few conditions in which you need to use an ankle brace. You also need to consult with your physician or an orthopedic for a professional advice regarding the entire healing process.\nSuggested to Wear Ankles Braces When:\nThe conditions that we have mentioned above are when you can use an ankle brace. Other than those conditions, following are a few scenarios where you should always take precautionary measures and keep yourself safe from ankle injuries.\nGoing for a run\nFrequent running may causes ankle sprain. You never know when you may twist your foot and end up with an excruciating pain. Wear an ankle brace for running to keep yourself safe from ankle sprains.\nPlaying extreme sports\nImpact sports such as volleyball, football, baseball, basketball and squash will make you more vulnerable to knee, ankle or elbow injuries.\nIt is highly recommended by the doctors that you always look for an ankle brace that will cater to your needs for a specific sport. For instance, if you play volleyball, you will easily find volleyball knee brace available in the market that is designed exclusively for the specific game.\nThe same way, you can easily find some of the best volleyball ankle brace or a baseball ankle brace that will cater to the needs of their respective sports.\nOther than that, you need to wear an ankle brace when you are exercising. If you are a gym freak and have a fitness regime under an experienced trainer, you are in good hands. But if you’re not exercising under supervision, always wear ankle braces for exercises that have an impact on your feet and legs.\nSo, these are a few times when you should wear an ankle brace and be vigilant about it. Make sure to do not overuse an ankle brace because that is harmful as well. Your rehabilitation process matters the most and you need to make sure you do not overuse your tired muscles."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ff11aac2-d8bb-4cf4-90ed-333703ebda90>","<urn:uuid:11b8cd36-69d6-4796-b4fe-d542ec0a38d9>"],"error":null}

{"question":"In my theology studies, I've encountered different hierarchies of angels. Could you explain how Sacred Scripture categorizes the different types of angels and if they're all considered equal?","answer":"Sacred Scripture reveals that angels are not all equal and are organized in a hierarchical structure. The Bible identifies several categories across both Old and New Testaments: In the Old Testament, there are angels, powers, virtues, cherubim, and seraphim. The New Testament adds principalities, dominations, thrones, and archangels. Catholic theology organizes these into three main categories: 1) The highest: cherubim, seraphim, and thrones, 2) Middle: dominations, powers, and virtues, 3) Lowest: principalities, archangels, and angels. Despite these differences in gifts and functions, there is never any envy among the angels.","context":["Father John A. Hardon, S.J. Archives\n|Return to: Home > Archives Index > Angelology Index|\nThe Angels in Sacred Scripture\nby Fr. John A. Hardon, S.J.\nBefore we continue on our meditations on the angels, I think we should pause on this one mediation to see that angels are not merely Christian piety, or Christian poetry, or Christian devotion. The angels are not a luxury to Christianity. Angels belong to the heart of our Catholic faith. In other words the existence, the nature, the purpose, the role of the angels, is an essential part of our faith. Only those who believe in angels are Christians.\nThe angels therefore belong to the mystery of Christianity. Deny their existence, function, or our devotion to the angels and it would be heresy. This is why it is so important to see what Divine Revelation in Sacred Scripture tells us about the angels. As the meditation goes on we will look more closely and more extensively on these numerous revelations on the angelic creatures.\nFor the present we will take a panoramic view of what Sacred Scripture, inspired by the Holy Spirit, tells us about these creatures and the angelic world.\nNeedless to say, we will be covering in this meditation will be exhaustive. We will cover the Old and the New testaments and will see how in the first and the last books of Sacred Scriptures, the angels are a part of Gods providence. Our purpose therefore is to see how far, then how they are made, and how a country like the United States, is strictly occupied with matter. Our very language says that if something is important it is material. Dear God! The Divine Trinity, the angels are immaterial. They are pure spirits, immaterial. We are living in a dream world if we are to believe that reality is only material reality.\nWhat we will concentrate on is the voice of the Holy Spirit. In the Old Testament an angel is called a moloch. In the New Testament, originally in Greek, it is angelos. Both words mean messenger. The word angel therefore, does not identify who an angel is. An individual intelligent being, a person with a mind and will. The word angel identifies what the angels do. They are messengers from God to us.\nAs we read the Old Testament we are told in one book after another, that the angels are messengers of Yahweh, messengers in numerous ways. An angel prevents Abraham from sacrificing his son Isaac. Angels appear to Moses in the burning bush. Angels appear to Elijah the Prophet. Angels lead the Israelites, miraculously to the red sea. Angels slay the enemies of the chosen people. In almost the whole book of Tobit or Tobias, it is described in great detail how an angel helps Tobit and his son.\nThe Old Testament especially features the angels as adorers of Yahweh. They are in another words, the host, the heavenly army of the adorers of the Almighty. It is the angelic world of adoring God which is the principal theme of the Psalms. The angels, we are told surround Yahweh, they form nothing less than a heavenly army. They are the Divine Retinue which serve and praise God, and their numbers are beyond counting.\nThe New Testament might almost be called the angelic part of Sacred Scriptures. From the beginning of the gospel of St. Matthew to the closing of the book of Revelation, the angels are featured as a part of Gods mysterious providence over the New Israel. Our Lord Jesus Christ often speaks of the angels. Referring to the children whom the disciples wanted to drive away. Now says our Lord. The angels in heaven are continually in the presence of my Father.\nAs we have seen in more detail during the retreat, the principal role of the angelic hosts is to honor, praise and adore God. They, in Marks gospel, our Lord foretelling the state of human beings in heavenly glory. No more marrying in heaven, no more begetting of children. The number of the predestined will be completed, says Jesus. In heaven they do not marry. They are like the angels. Each angel is an individual person, and individual species, according to our Catholic theology. There are no angel fathers or mothers for the obvious reasons, they have no bodies.\nThe angels appear at the beginning and at the end of Christs visible stay on earth. An angel announces the conception of the Savior. Angels appear to the Shepherds to tell them the Messiah is born. And when the disciples on Ascension day, kept looking up and staring, Where did Jesus go. The angels of the disciples told them that was enough looking and to stop. They told them that Christ will come, but, in His majesty.\nSaints Peter, John, and Paul, are three principal New Testament spokesmen for the angel. They wrote extensively on the angels not only during Christs visible stay on earth not only during apostolic times, not only until the end of the first century of Christian history, but they foretell how the angels just as they had been with Christ on His physical stay on earth, so they will stay with His Church until the end of Time.\nAmong the Jews as we know, all the Sadducees denied the existence of angels. Over the years in both teaching Judaism and knowing Jewish people, the same distinction can be made today. The truly believing Jews believe in angels. The Sadducees, as in first century Palestine, deny the existence of Angels.\nWhat do Sacred Scriptures tell us about the nature of the angels? A great deal. In Pauls letter to the Hebrews, he describes the angels as spirits. St. Luke said that the angels have no bodies. St. Paul, in his letter to the Colossians, identified the angels as creatures. Time began when the angels were created. St. Matthew made sure that believers in Christ believed that the angels had no gender. There is no male or female among the angels, again for the obvious reason, the angels do not have bodies. St. Luke again tells us that the angels are immortal. Once God creates a spirit, whether the angelic spirit of an angel or our immortal spirit, neither the angel nor our soul will die.\nLike the angels we are immortal. We were created for eternity. St. Paul again, this time to the Ephesians, speaks at great length about the wisdom of the angels. Wisdom as we know is that knowledge in the mind that provides great joy and happiness to the will. One reason again as we shall see in greater detail we should ask for the angels intercession with God. Angels intercession with God has to do with a profound reason.\nAgain St. Luke in the letters to the Evangelists about the angelic world stated that the angels have a free will. They had a free will when they were first created and those now in heaven still have a free will. Of course the only choice they make now in the beatific vision is to choose to love God. The angels, we are told by St. Matthew, see God. How we better make this clear. We not only believe in God, we accept on faith His existence. But the angels see Him face to face. There is no intermediary. There are not even ideas standing between the angelic mind and the Holy Trinity. They see Him directly, intuitively, immediately.\nFinally, as the whole Bible but especially the closing book of the New Testament tells us, the angels are holy. Holiness means God-likeness. The angels are most like God. Angels are spiritual beings like God. And they are like God because their will are united to the will of the Holy Trinity.\nDoes Sacred Scripture tell us something about the number of the angels? There is no specific enumeration. The Bible tells us there are legions, and legion in sacred scripture means a countless number. The New Testament tells us the angels form a multitude. St. Paul tells us there are many thousands. And in the closing book of the bible, which talks about the angels in the first closing chapter of the Apocalypse, angels are part of the life of the mystical body and will be an essential part of the eternal destiny to which we are looking forward.\nSays St. John, There are thousands upon thousands of angels adoring God. Just a word of explanation. Can we really talk about the number of angels if they have no bodies? For example, I can say there are three pieces of paper in front of me. Or I can say there is a glass of water. Can we speak of the number of the angels if they have no bodies? Yes. Yes. Numbers have nothing to do with bodies. There are three persons in the Holy Trinity and the Holy Trinity is surely infinite, uncreated, divine, spiritual being.\nWhy can we speak about the number of the angels? Because each angel is an individual. Each angel is a person. Each angel is distinct from another angel separate from another angel.\nThe Sacred Scriptures tell us something about the hierarchy of the angels. Hierarchy means holy. Angels are holy. Hierarchy also means classification.\nAre all the angels equal? No. Are there some angels higher than others? Yes. In Sacred Scripture we find in the Old Testament seven categories or classes of angels. They are identified as: angels, powers, and virtues. In the New Testament they are identified as principalities and dominations, as thrones and archangels. In the Old Testament they are identified as two main classes, the cherubim and seraphim.\nOver the centuries the Catholic teaching on the angels, called angelology, theologians divide these three time three categories, make it nine, on the angels. The highest category are the cherubim, seraphim and the thrones. The next category are the dominations, power, and the virtues. And the last, shall we say the lowest category are the principalities, archangels, and angels.\nA lesson for us, I think, is crucial. Does God love all of us? An emphatic yes. Has God gifted all human beings equally? No two people are equal. The hierarchy among the angels, the differences, and not just differences in function, but differences in the gifts which they received from God, teach us that among human beings, there are some who are gifted naturally and supernaturally.\nAlthough the angels differ so widely in function and in the gifts they receive, there is never any envy among the angels. The angels know there is a hierarchy among human beings, not just in Church, there is a hierarchy in the whole human race. No two human beings are equally gifted by God. And all the while we believe that God wants us to love those who may be more gifted than we and not envy them, or less gifted than we and not dominating them.\nIn Sacred Scriptures, we are told at great length that the angels have a very special function in their relationship to God. Two words recur in Old and New Testament. Angels worshipped God. Angels obeyed God. Those who deserved Heaven obeyed God and are now in heavenly Glory. And the angels praise God. We are told by St. Paul that this is the language of the angels, to praise God. One more area of angelic revelation in Sacred Scripture.\nThe angelic relationship to Jesus Christ. They announced His conception, His birth. The angels have been worshipping Christ since He was conceived in His mothers womb. The angels minister to Jesus. Let us not forget, especially in the desert. The angels, what mysterious words, the angels strengthened Jesus Christ during His Agony in the Garden in His humanity. The angels were heralds of His Resurrection. They were witnesses of His Ascension. And the angels, we are told by Sacred Scripture, will announce His final coming. When Christ, who was crucified for our salvation, will come in majesty, and then no longer submitting to the humiliation of the Crucifixion, escorted by the angels, will come to judge the living and the dead.\nLord Jesus, Master of the angels, help us. Help us to recover what we had lost and strengthen where we are weakened in our realization of the vast angelic world. Deepen our appreciation of the angels who pronounced your birth to the shepherds and through the shepherds to us, the Good News of our Salvation.\nDallas Carmelites, Conference #3, Saturday 2/24/96, 4:30 PM\nCopyright © 1996 Inter Mirifica\nWhat's New Site Index\nHome | Directory | Eucharist | Divine Training | Testimonials | Visit Chapel | Hardon Archives\nAdorers Society | PEA Manual | Essentials of Faith | Dictionary | Thesaurus | Catalog | Newsletters"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:60ca8de6-b177-445d-8407-b94ec32f39d4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between judging criteria for photo contests versus online art gallery submissions when it comes to image presentation and technical requirements?","answer":"Photo contests and online art gallery submissions have distinct judging criteria regarding image presentation. For photo contests, judges focus heavily on artistic intent, composition, proper focus, and appropriate lighting, rejecting images that show poor subject selection or misunderstanding of compositional rules. They also scrutinize technical aspects like HDR usage and filter applications. In contrast, online art galleries primarily emphasize technical presentation requirements, specifically rejecting framed images, photos with hot spots from direct flash, underexposed images, and any submissions containing digital markings or watermarks. While both venues care about image quality, photo contests place more emphasis on artistic merit and compositional choices, while online galleries focus more on standardized presentation formats and technical reproducibility of the artwork.","context":["Judges of photo contests have a unique perspective because we see so very many photos. Sometimes the difference between being a finalist in a contest and being rejected comes down to minute differences in technique, composition and tone, and sometimes it’s much less subtle. Bad composition, poor subject selection, a misunderstanding of the rules of composition (and when to break them) and a huge array of pet snapshots comprise the majority of submissions for a contest.\nWe’ve seen it all, and we’re going to see it all again in the next contest. Trust me when I say that we don’t want to see bad photography in a contest. It gives no joy to reject a photo. Each photo we “reject” when we’re rating images causes a slight pang of regret. We know it’s a person who had high hopes of winning, someone who took a picture and looked at it and said, “I love this photo, the judges will, too.”\nWhile judging a contest, a few common themes come up, a set of tips we wish we could transmit to our submitters—some thoughts about the process of capturing images, in general, and some things that judges are looking for, things that can help your photography, whether you’re entering a contest or not.\nINTENT IS EVERYTHING\nMy good friend, photographer Martin Gisborne, wrote this on his Facebook page. “One of the things that I’ve always loved about photography—and one of the things that I try and impress upon people when they ask me about becoming a better photographer—is that you need to learn how to see. You need to look. A lot. You need to figure out what you are seeing, figure out why there is interest, there, for you. Only once you’ve done that can you figure out how to translate that into a photograph.\nOnce you start to really look at the world, then you’ll look at the world in a different way whether you have a camera in your hand or not. And I love that.”\nThere’s a marked difference in photography between seeing and looking. Snapshots see the world. Selfies see the world. Good photographs look carefully at it. They pick out the details of a scene, they look for the contrasts, the beauty and the humor in everyday life.\nEvery photo submitted to a contest needs to have been from looking at the scene and crafting an image. It might take a microsecond to look and to feel a scene—this is true of the world’s best sports photographers—but it took a lifetime of trying to look in order to be able to do it in an instant.\nAn instructor of mine at art school once said to me, “What we call art, it’s the byproduct of real art.” The art is the creative process, not the finished photo.\nIf a photograph doesn’t convey attention or intent, then it’s not going to win. Judges can feel the intent of a photo (or the lack of it). The winning photos often hit us the second we see them. The job of the photograph is to carry the emotion of the creation of art, and we can feel if a photograph is missing that intent.\nUNDERSTAND WHAT THE CONTEST IS ABOUT\nI can’t count the number of times I’ve seen a color image submitted to a contest that’s for black-and-white photography. That’s an automatic reject.\nIf the contest is a portrait contest, don’t submit a landscape with no people. If the photo is for a macro contest, don’t submit urban street scenes (unless they show how nature breaks through that landscape).\nLikewise, if the contest is for sports photography, be sure there’s some sport represented in there. It could be the celebration after the sport, it could be a locker room scene before a match, heck, I’d even like to see a shot of people filling up a bar to watch the Stanley Cup finals on TV or at a tailgate party—but there has to be something that says it’s a sports photo.\nMAKE SURE YOUR PHOTOS ARE IN FOCUS\nThis rule seems so obvious that most people will skip past this, but stick with me. Not only do we get photos that are completely out of focus—there isn’t a focus point anywhere in the photo—we get them where the wrong thing is in focus.\nWe see portraits where the subject’s nose or earlobe is the focus, not the eyes. We see this all…the…time. If you’re using focus as a compositional tool, be sure the photo is clear enough to explain why the focus is on something besides the obvious subject.\nSometimes we wonder if particular images are out of focus because of the output of the file submitted. I suspect that often there’s a general softness issue that crops up when people export photos without attention to this effect. But the photograph you submit is the one that we judge. Before you send it, check it at 100% and see if everything looks good, because we’ll judge finalists at that resolution, as well.\nWILL THIS SUBJECT MATTER TO ANYONE ELSE?\nA huge problem with most submissions it that the subjects chosen are often personal to the photographer, but meaningless to anyone else. Your cat, your child, your parakeet—they aren’t interesting by themselves to anyone but you and your immediate family. This is perhaps the most heartbreaking part of judging a contest—we see photos of kids or pets that are obviously packed with love, but the photos are meaningless. If there’s no unique perspective on a cat, then it’s just another cat photo.\nGenerally, we’re done with seeing pets and babies, unless the contest is called “Pets and Babies,” and then we’re all in, which brings up these next rules.\nCOMPOSITION, COMPOSITION, COMPOSITION\nThe winning photos in contests are well composed, either through purposeful setup or through simply having a good eye when the photo is captured. Poor composition will result in elimination, even if the rest of the photo is amazing.\nBe wary of distracting elements in a photo—tree limbs, lampposts, stray hairs (that’s really important in portrait and wedding contests), other people, etc.\nLearn about the Rule of Thirds, and when to break it. Many times, the winning photos in a contest are those that successfully flout conventions, but do so in a way that’s intriguing, not off-putting. A crooked horizon works if it adds to the photo, it doesn’t work if it’s accidental. Likewise, an object blocking part of the frame works if it’s put there intentionally and contextualizes the photo.\nA lot of photography is about what’s not in a photo.\nMany photographers are afraid of utilizing light, either on-camera or off-camera. That’s a shame, because a lot of the best photos we see are masterfully lit. In any photo contest, someone is going to submit something that’s well lit, and a lot of people are going to submit things that needed a boost from lighting. If we’re between two similar photos and one is better lit, that’s the winner.\nGood lighting doesn’t a\nlways mean using flash lighting or even man-made lighting. Sometimes it’s a matter of successfully using a diffuser or bouncing light off a reflector. Sometimes it’s just a matter of facing subjects toward the setting sunlight or a campfire or a car’s headlights, and not shooting them with the sun behind them and shadows on their face.\nTHINK OF YOUR COMPETITORS\nWhen you’re entering a contest, think about your competitors and what they might be offering, and ask yourself if what you’re submitting is likely to be better than that of the other entrants.\nIn one landscape and travel contest I judged, several entrants did beautiful shots of bridges; in fact, I saw more than half a dozen bridges. The one that went to the round of finalists had the most masterful use of lighting and composition of the bunch, but the margin was narrow.\nMany times this difference is more obvious, usually with common subjects. In travel photographs, there often will be several photos of markets and locals (read on for more on that), so I put them aside to compare them all as a group, comparing the success of the images against the other shots of the same type of subject.\nONLY ONE TAKE\nEntrants occasionally will submit multiple takes of a photo. Sometimes these alternates are different crops of the same photo, sometimes they’re both a color and a monochrome version of the image. What this communicates is that the photographer is unsure of the best version of his or her image. And if photographers can’t tell which of their photos is the good one, we can’t, either.\nENOUGH OF HDR ALREADY\nHDR photography disasters are aplenty in photo contests, especially those with landscapes and travel themes. HDR (high dynamic range, if you’re not familiar) photos combine a number of shots at different exposures to create an image with a more natural and vibrant representation of a scene than a single exposure can capture. It’s very handy for bringing out both the highlights and the shadows in a scene.\nHowever, HDR is often used to create images with hypersaturated colors and unrealistic tonal range, and these super-tonal photos usually go right to rejects.\nENOUGH OF THE FILTERS ALREADY\nA corollary to the HDR rule—we know there are some impressive filters for Photoshop. It’s not necessary to show us that you found some cool ones, unless it actually improves your images. Most egregious are portrait shots that are smoothed out by retouching software past where they should be used, and the result is someone who looks like they’re made of rubber.\nDON’T DROP IN OR REMOVE ELEMENTS UNNECESSARILY OR UNSKILLFULLY\nDon’t use Photoshop to place a moon over a building. And, if you should use Photoshop to drop in a moon over a building, be sure to do it well. I’ve seen moons in photos where the selection wasn’t smooth enough and the ’shopped moon had jagged edges. The moon doesn’t have jagged edges, and contest judges know that.\nI’ve also seen images where the Clone Stamp is used improperly to remove something, and it leaves an incongruous, large, blotchy spot behind. That’s an immediate reject. If something is removed (like dust), there should be no trace of it.\nSTOP TAKING PICTURES OF ANONYMOUS WRINKLED PEOPLE\nTravel contests are filled with images of older people in some suitable foreign location with a surfeit of wrinkles. While that’s fine on the surface (pardon the pun), the problem is that usually there’s no connection between the photographer and the subject. These pictures often appear to be captured hastily, usually surreptitiously.\nThis can work, but the most successful photos of people in other lands convey a connection between the photographer and the subject (that’s not just true of travel photos), and the language and cultural barriers in many of these photos show that there was little attempt to break down that barrier. We see a lot of half-smiles or grimaces on the faces of the subjects, indicating the camera is a bit of an inconvenience to them.\nOne of the best tips I ever read for the serious food photographer was to hire a local guide for at least one day that you shoot. In most Asian, African and South American countries (where the bulk of these submissions seem to come from), guides are incredibly affordable, and hiring a local gives you incredible access to people and places. (You can Google to find a guide in-country while you’re planning your trip, but you often can ask your hotel if they recommend someone, as well.)\nFOLLOW THE RULES\nThe tips for making a winning contest entry are, of course, the same as the rules for making good pictures, in general: authenticity, simplicity, emotion and composition. That’s what people are looking for in a good photograph, whether it’s for a contest or not.\nYou can reach David Schloss on Twitter and Instagram @davidjschloss","Every month Light Space & Time Online Art Gallery will receive entries that we simply cannot use due to the poor quality of the images submitted by the artist. Here are the top 5 art submission problems that we see every month. In this article, we will present these problems and issues, visually with example images, in a slide show at the bottom of this post. Next to this paragraph is the post image of the Edward Hopper’s “The Long Leg” print as our example of how we (and I am sure every other serious art gallery or art organization) would like to receive any entries to our art competitions.\nBelow are the top 5 common presentation problems that we frequently receive:\n1. Framed Images – We see images that are submitted to our gallery that are framed, crooked and not level. Submitted images such as this will not be accepted, as it detracts from our gallery presentations and shows.\nOn a wall, in many cases, framing will help to establish, highlight and enhance the appearance of any art. On a website, the exact opposite is true and any framing of art will detract and take away the appearance of the art. We simply will not present art in that manner and in our rules, as well in and throughout our submission process this fact is stated several times and in different ways.\nOur main focus and goal is to have a show which not only represents the best art which was submitted to us, but also to have art that will show well to our gallery visitors. Any images which are framed, crooked and the image lines are not level, in our opinion, is unacceptable art to have in any of our online art shows.\n2. Images Have Hot Spots – Any images that are submitted that have highlights or over exposed “hot spots” on the image will not be used as well. This condition is caused by using a flash camera directly in front of the painting that you are trying to reproduce.\nObviously, the best solution (though it is the most expensive) is to have the art professionally scanned. However, the next best thing to do is to have the art photographed in a natural outdoor, diffused light. See our article How to Photograph Your Art the Right Way. Any images of paintings or any photographs should always be color corrected, balanced and appear as natural as possible to the original.\n3. Under Exposed Images – Artists, who submit underexposed images of their art, will result in not being selected for our art shows. Besides being difficult to see, evaluate and to judge, this type of presentation of an artist’s art will not be shown to anyone who visits our website.\n4. Images With Digital Markings – Art which is submitted to us which contains any digital markings on the face of the image will not be used in our shows, no matter how good that we think that the art is. Any digital marks with dates and other Meta data simply detracts, not only from the art and but also from the show’s overall appearance, presentation and will not be considered to be included.\n5. Images with Watermarks – Any art which is submitted with watermarks will not be used by our art gallery. Watermarks do not allow us to judge the art fully, as a watermark takes away from our goal of having the most professional and best online art show that there is on the internet. This issue also holds true for any art which contains any large artist signatures or signs. If we like the art, and believe that is “show worthy” we will try to crop it out, but if not, it is just better to submit to us the purest form of your art that there is without any watermarks.\nMany artists believe that by having watermarks or large signatures on their art that this will protect them from someone stealing their art on the internet. We believe that a 1000 pixel wide x 100 resolution image (that is what any of the art on our website gets resized to for our shows) when printed will produce a 10” wide image of rather poor quality and an image that is not worth reproducing.\nIf as an artist, you are afraid that someone will steal your art and then you should take all of your art off the internet right now, as I guarantee, that eventually someone will do this to you. It just the way the internet is! However, since we all need the internet, the best thing to do is to at least make the posted art of such quality, in order to not make it worthwhile for the thief to steal.\nThese are submission problems that we commonly see and these exmaples will cause us to reject someone’s particular art. There are articles on this website that can help you improve your presentations and there are also many free programs on the internet that you can download or use that will allow you to enhance your art when submitting for any art exhibitions and art shows.\nA good reproduction of your art may mean the difference between getting into an important art gallery, art exhibition or for making a sale of your art. Therefore, it is well worth the time to take to learn how to improve your art presentations and art submissions and have them done the right way."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:fa18ea76-fcad-408d-a553-93df02bba306>","<urn:uuid:42ff26ae-1814-42c2-9279-b24f0653bf52>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Compare beliefs about universe vs reality in different Hindu schools","answer":"There are three main Hindu perspectives on how the universe relates to ultimate reality (Brahman): 1) The nondualists (advaita) view Brahman as the only reality and consider the world as illusory (maya), 2) The qualified nondualists (vishishtadvaita) believe both Brahman and the universe are real, with the universe being an extension of Brahman's Being, and 3) The dualists (dvaita) consider Brahman and the universe as two distinct realities.","context":["Article ID: DH122 | By: Dean C. Halverson and Natun Bhattacharya\nOf the 760-800 million Hindus in the world, approximately one million reside in the United States. In Part Two of this article, we will offer specific pointers on witnessing to Hindus. But first it is important for readers to have some understanding of the historical and philosophical background of Hinduism, and that is what this installment will provide.\nThe origins of Hinduism can be traced back to the polytheistic and ritualistic religions that began around 1500 B.C. in India’s Indus Valley. At first, the rituals were so simple that fathers could perform them. As the centuries passed, however, they became increasingly complex. This made it necessary to create a class of priests specially trained to perform the intricate rituals correctly, because the consequences for incorrectly performing a ritual were considered costly. During this time, the Hindu scriptures known as the Vedas were written to instruct the priests in how to conduct the rituals.\nBecause of how exclusive the priests became in appeasing the gods, they gained a power over the people that became unbearable. Around 600 B.C., the people revolted, and the form of Hinduism that emerged was more mystically oriented, focusing on the individual rather than the priest.\nBetween 800 and 300 B.C. the Upanishads were written. They expound on the idea that behind the many gods stands one Reality, called Brahman — an impersonal, monistic (“all is one”) force. The highest form of Brahman is nirguna (“without attributes or qualities”).\nThe Hindu concept of God continued to develop even after the Upanishads were written. Nirguna Brahman became saguna Brahman, which is Brahman “with attributes,” and is called Ishvara.\nAccording to Hindu tradition, Ishvara became known to humanity through the Trimurti (“three manifestations”) of Brahman. Those manifestations include Brahma (the Creator), Vishnu (the Preserver), and Shiva (the Destroyer). Ishvara became personified even further through the ten mythical incarnations, or avatars, of Vishnu in the forms of both animals and persons. Beyond the principal deities of the Trimurti, it is estimated that there are 330 million other gods in Hinduism (Halverson, 87-89).\nHinduism is amazing in its diversity and in its ability to absorb such a diversity into one belief system. Such diversity can cause interesting situations, such as when that religion is transported to another country like the United States. For example, it was reported in Hinduism Today, “In Nashville, Hindus building a temple sent out a ballot to decide which would be the central Deity, since there [were] worshipers of Kali, Krishna and Shiva in their area. It was democratically voted to choose Lord Ganesha” (Melwani).\nOne of the ways in which Hinduism is divided is according to their varied views on how the universe is related to ultimate reality (Brahman). The nondualists (advaita) see Brahman alone as being real and the world as illusory (maya). The qualified nondualists (vishishtadvaita) affirm the reality of both Brahman and the universe in that the universe is extended from the Being of Brahman. And the dualists (dvaita) see Brahman and the universe as being two distinct realities.\nWhile Hinduism is certainly diverse, most Hindus hold to the following beliefs:\n- The Impersonal Nature of Brahman. Hindus see ultimate reality, Brahman, as being an impersonal oneness that is beyond all distinctions, including personal and moral distinctions.\n- The Brahman-Atman Unity. Hindus believe they are, in their true selves (atman), extended from, and one with, Brahman. Just as the air inside an open jar is identical to the air surrounding that jar, so our essence is identical to that of the essence of Brahman.\n- The Problem Is Ignorance. Humanity’s primary problem is that we are ignorant of our divine nature. We have forgotten that we are extended from Brahman, and we have mistakenly attached ourselves to the desires of our separate selves, or egos, and thereby to the consequences of their resultant actions as determined by the law of karma (cause and effect).\n- Samsara (Reincarnation). Samsara refers to the ever-revolving wheel of life, death, and rebirth. Through the law of karma we are reaping in this lifetime the consequences of the actions we committed in previous lifetimes. A person’s karma determines the kind of body — ranging from human to insect — into which he or she will be reincarnated in the next lifetime.\n- Moksha (Liberation). The solution to the problem of attachment and karma is moksha — to be liberated from the wheel of life, death, and rebirth. This can only occur when we truly realize that our separate self is actually an illusion and that only the undifferentiated oneness of Brahman is real. We must therefore strive to detach ourselves from the desires and actions of our ego in order to attain true enlightenment.\nDean C.

Only Ethiopia and Liberia were independent. But Germany’s defeat in the first world war brought about a reworking of the colonial order with its possessions in what are now Tanzania, Cameroon, Togo, Burundi and Rwanda distributed among the war’s victors — Britain, France and Belgium. German South West Africa, now Namibia, fell under South African control.\nMandela was a citizen of a new country: South Africa had been born eight years earlier with the unification of four British colonies, including the two former Afrikaner republics of the Transvaal and the Orange Free State, taken over after the Boer war.\nThe Boer struggle was widely seen as the first anti-colonial fight of the 20th century against the British Empire.\nSouth Africa, because of its large white population, was a politically autonomous dominion under the British crown, unlike the U.K.’s other African colonies. In 1918, some territories were still regarded as the private property of commercial companies. Southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, was owned by the British South Africa Co. and would not be recognized as a colony until 1923.\nWhatever the status of territory, the plunder of Africa’s wealth — its gold, rubber, tobacco, diamonds, ivory and copper — was unrelenting. But the seeds of the independence movements were sown with the hundreds of thousands of Africans who served in the first world war helping to raise political awareness and challenge white claims of racial superiority.\nInvasion and WWII (1936-1945):\nEthiopia was one of only two independent countries in Africa when Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini decided to expand his small “African empire.” Italy invaded in 1936, overthrowing Emperor Haile Selassie and confirming the League of Nations as toothless in the face of fascist aggression. Ethiopia was integrated into Italian East Africa with Eritrea and Italian Somaliland.\nFrom 1940, the desert war raged across North Africa for three years, swinging from French Tunisia through Italian Libya to within striking distance of Cairo. That conflict once again remade the colonial map, with Italy forced to relinquish its rule of Libya and Somalia, and Ethiopia liberated in 1941. It was also deciding the future of imperial rule in less immediately evident ways. After the war, France recovered possession of Tunisia, where a sizeable expatriate population lived, but its authority was fatally undermined and it was independent within a few years, along with Morocco.\nNewly demobilized African soldiers who served the allied cause in north and east Africa, Europe and Asia arrived home questioning the contradiction between the Allies’ trumpeting of freedom with the continued subjugation of Africa.\nA smattering of well-educated anti-colonial leaders provided the arguments and the direction to draw increasingly restless Africans into the struggle for their freedom.\nThe dawn of Apartheid (1948):\nThe National Party won power in South Africa with an unexpected and narrow victory on a platform of more rigid race segregation. Afrikaner leaders portrayed apartheid as a form of social uplift for poorer whites, in part by protecting their jobs from cheaper black labor. The vote for the National Party was also in part a backlash against British influence by Afrikaners still bitter about the Boer war and loss of self-determination. At the time, Britain and its western allies sought to placate the new government in Pretoria, which did not immediately look so out of step with the colonial regimes and their systems of race-based privilege, power and segregation.\nBut as British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan reminded the South African parliament in his “wind of change” speech in Cape Town in 1960, the apartheid government was on the wrong side of history. South Africa left the British Commonwealth the following year.\nThe rapid decolonization of most of Africa helped drive the white regime’s increasingly repressive response to resistance to apartheid legislation, including the arrest and trial of Mandela and other ANC leaders.\nGrowing decolonization (1956):\nThe tumble of decolonization across sub-Saharan Africa began with the Gold Coast, reborn as Ghana in 1957.\nGhana’s first president, Kwame Nkrumah, espoused a pan-African philosophy that inspired other subjugated nations and alarmed complacent imperialists who initially imagined they could drag out the independence process in other parts of Africa, especially in countries where there were large numbers of white settlers.\nBut Britain had learned the hard way with the Mau Mau rebellion in Kenya that if it was not prepared to negotiate an end to its rule then Africans would fight for it. Within a few years, most of Britain’s colonies in Africa had gained independence or were on the brink of it.\nFrance gave up control of two of its north African Arab colonies, Tunisia and Morocco, in 1956 in the hope of clinging to a third — Algeria, then home to close to 1 million white settlers, which Paris regarded as a department of France.\nThe ensuing struggle brought down the French Fourth Republic and stripped Paris of its colonial delusions. Paris’s brutal “pacification” of the independence struggle pushed Algeria to civil war. The French claimed military victory but the political shock at home was so great that Algerian independence could no longer be resisted.\nThe Algerian war helped dispel any lingering hopes of France holding on to its sub-Saharan colonies and most were freed in a burst of independence celebrations in 1960. Belgium pulled out of the Democratic Republic of the Congo the same year, and Rwanda and Burundi two years later.\nBut Paris made sure to hold its former colonies close through economic, political and military ties, including underpinning regional currencies.\nWhite resistance (1960-1980):\nAs the imperial powers withdrew, the determination of the remaining settler administrations to hold on to power hardened. Ian Smith’s white government in Rhodesia made a unilateral declaration of independence on Nov. 11, 1965, in resistance to the U.K.’s plans to make the colony independent. Britain declared the move an “act of treason.” Rhodesia found backing from apartheid South Africa, including crucial economic assistance, and Portugal, which gave access to ports in Mozambique. But Rhodesia was besieged by sanctions and then an escalating insurgency in the 1970s which strengthened after Mozambique gained independence and provided a base for Robert Mugabe’s ZANU guerrillas. Eventually, the white minority regime was overwhelmed by the military and economic pressures, although Smith later blamed South Africa for Rhodesia’s collapse, saying it had been “stabbed in the back” by Pretoria. Mugabe became the first — and only prime minister — of an independent Zimbabwe in 1980.\nArmed independence movements launched rebellions in the early ’60s in Portugal’s remaining territories — Angola, Mozambique and Guinea — and were met with increasing brutality. The economic and political toll of the conflict helped prompt a coup in 1974 that overthrew the right-wing regime in Lisbon. Angola, Mozambique and Guinea-Bissau gained independence the following year.\nThe Cold War (1960-1980s):\nThe early hope of the newly independent African nations was rapidly undermined by the Cold War struggle as Soviet backing for African liberation movements was countered by American support for military coups and authoritarian leadership.\nUnder protection of western aid based largely on anti-communist credentials with little concern about the quality of governance, military dictatorships and one-party states run by presidents-for-life emerged from Nigeria to Malawi, Kenya to Zambia, Zaire to Cote d’Ivoire, while the Soviets sponsored governments such as Ethiopia and Mozambique.\nThe Cold War confrontation was at its bloodiest in Angola, where the Soviet-backed government and Cuban troops fought a long war against Jonas Savimbi’s U.S.-sponsored rebels and South Africa’s army. The conflict destroyed towns and villages across the oil-rich country and cost hundreds of thousands of lives.\nFor many years during the 1970s and 1980s, Africa was defined to much of the rest of the world by its more brutal and extreme leaders, such as Uganda’s Idi Amin, who was regarded as part clown and part monster, and Zaire’s Mobutu Sese Seko, who stole billions of dollars while his country collapsed around him.\nApartheid’s end in sight (1976):\nNeither South Africa’s white regime nor Mandela’s African National Congress predicted the Soweto uprising, which kicked off the escalating popular resistance that played a central role in bringing down apartheid. On June 16, 1976, thousands of students took to the streets against the government, forcing black schools to teach many lessons in Afrikaans, not only regarded as the language of the oppressor but also as a further means of keeping black people down.\nThe South African police responded to the protest with violence, killing 23 people on the first day, including 13-year-old Hector Pieterson, who became a symbol of the uprising. Hundreds more died in the following months. The protests put the ANC at the forefront of the liberation struggle inside the country. The white regime responded with increasing repression that only fed the popular resistance and gave rise to a broad coalition of opponents of apartheid, including trade unions, churches and civic groups, under the umbrella of the United Democratic Front. The white government’s increasingly heavy-handed response, including declaring a state of emergency, fueled international outrage and led to the tightening of sanctions.\nMandela’s release (1990):\nMandela’s release from prison on Feb. 11, 1990, prompted a wave of expectation among people across Africa weary of maladministration and political leaders clinging to power.\nOld leaders were forced out across the continent, including in Zambia, Malawi and Kenya. A much heralded “new breed” of leader had already emerged led by Yoweri Museveni in Uganda, although he, too, came to be accused of authoritarian tendencies after ruling his country for longer than any of his predecessors.\nThe push for political change was less successful elsewhere, and in Nigeria it resulted in another military coup. Newfound political freedom could not release African nations from their dependence on foreign aid, which came with added strings requiring adherence to western neo-liberal economics. Some African states had already suffered the imposition of International Monetary Fund and World Bank economic plans that proved particularly harsh on the poorest by reversing the benefits they enjoyed, such as free schooling. More countries were forced into privatization programs and other measures that caused hardship and undermined support for newly elected democratic governments.\nMandela was elected South Africa’s president in 1994 and set an example by stepping down five years later. He was replaced by his deputy, Thabo Mbeki, regarded in the West as a steady pair of hands with a strong intellect, but his credibility was eroded by outlandish views on the AIDS epidemic and for siding with Zimbabwe’s Robert Mugabe.\nGenocide on the continent (1994):\nAs South Africa celebrated its newfound democracy, Rwanda was descending into its own particular hell. The post-Cold War pressure for democratization combined with the legacy of colonial racial theory to prompt Hutu extremists to attempt to cling on to power by engineering the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Tutsis. The genocide set in motion a series of events that saw the toppling of neighboring Zaire’s long-standing ruler, Mobutu Sese Seko, and years of war in what became the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Out of the tragedy emerged a new Rwanda led by one of Africa’s most polarizing leaders, President Paul Kagame.\nThe Rwandan genocide also helped shape international justice, with a United Nations tribunal to try the organizers of the slaughter that presaged another in Sierra Leone and the birth of the International Criminal Court.\nAfrican leaders initially welcomed the ICC after it indicted Joseph Kony, leader of the Lords Resistance Army responsible for recruiting child soldiers and other crimes in Uganda. But the mood changed as the court came to be seen increasingly as exercising a double standard in indicting African leaders, including in Sudan and Kenya, while avoiding investigation of actions of western leaders in Afghanistan and Iraq.\nA future with China?\nChina is emerging as the new foreign economic and political force in Africa. Some have condemned Beijing’s rising influence as a new form of neo-colonization. Others praise China for helping to release African nations from their dependence on western aid.\nChina’s thirst for minerals and oil, and its hunt for markets for its goods, has seen it develop close ties to Angola, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It has bought up copper mines in Zambia and all but killed the textile industry there by flooding the country with cheap clothes.\nCritics of Beijing’s expanding influence in Africa say that China is so hungry for resources it does deals with authoritarian regimes and doles out aid without consideration for good governance.\nBut China has also delivered on promised aid after decades in which western governments cared more about the political alignments of African leaders than development of their countries. Beijing has built an extensive new network of roads in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, for instance, after decades in which the number of paved roads fell sharply despite billions of dollars in western aid."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:90d2bf06-40dd-42e9-b628-89a3339313da>","<urn:uuid:639c5dc3-7375-4e91-aa74-c315f8ed58e2>"],"error":null}
{"question":"clean bike chainring or chain - which need more often?","answer":"Chains require more frequent cleaning and maintenance compared to chainrings. While regular chainring cleaning helps increase durability through a 7-step process (lifting chain, cleaning grime, using soapy brush, thorough brushing, applying degreaser, rinsing, and lubricating), chains need particularly careful attention especially in gritty or wet environments as they wear out faster. Chain maintenance directly affects its lifespan, which can range from 1,000 to 6,000 kilometers, while chainrings with proper care can last up to 10,000 kilometers.","context":["The chainring of a bike is a critical part of the bike that helps to transfer the power from the pedals to the wheel. Therefore, good chainrings can greatly reduce the difficulty of your riding. Likewise, a bad chainring can make riding your bike more difficult. Fortunately or unfortunately, not all bike chainrings are universal.\nBike chainrings come in different sizes depending on the width of the bike cranks. Same way, chainsets are chainset are available in different types and sizes. The number of teeth in it often determines the gear range of the bike. For most riders, a medium-sized chainring is ideal, as they provide a good balance between gear range and durability.\nIn this article, I will discuss various issues about bike chainrings and chainsets. If you are an enthusiast bike rider, then this article is for you. So, please keep reading until the end to grasp the in-depth knowledge.\nWhat Are Chainrings On A Bike?\nBike chainring refers to its front gear also known as crankset. It is connected to the rear gears through a chain and drives the bike forward by supplying power to the rear wheels.\nChainring has many teeth through which the chain passes. The size of the chainring may vary based on the make and model of the bike. Moreover, a chainring can have from 20 to 60 teeth. And, the front assembly with the chainring is commonly called the “crankset or chainset”.\nDifferences Among Chainrings, Chainsets, And Cranksets\nBasically, chainset and crankset are the same things. I have noticed that many people all over the web want to know the difference between chainsets and cranksets. Besides, they want to know what the chainset or crankset is as well.\n- Well, this part of the bike is usually called the ‘crankset’ in the US and the ‘chainset’ in the UK. However, there is a difference between the chainring and chainset or crankset that many do not know.\n- The only difference between chainring and chainset or crankset is that chainset or crankset is a complete system. It provides power to the rear wheels through the chain and helps the bike move. But the chainring is the part of the crankset to which the chain is attached.\nAre All Bike Chainrings Universal?\nNo, chainrings of all bikes are not universal at all.\nIf you want to change the chainring of your bike, you must know the BCD of chaining.\nThen, what does BCD stand for? – BCD is the bolt circle diameter that passes through the center of the bolts on your crankset.\nAnd, the Chainring can vary depending on the model of the bike, the company, and many more.\nYou May Like: Are Bike Handlebar Grips Universal?\nHow Long Does A Bike Chainring Last?\nBike chainrings last for a long time depending on your usage, maintenance, road conditions, and some more facts.\n- But we can calculate it like this: after every three chain changes, you should change the cassette. Moreover, you should change the chainring after every two cassette changes.\nUsually, you can use your bike chain up to 1000 to 6000 kilometers.\n- If I take the distance as a standard of 1000 km, then you need to change the cassette after every 3000 km of bike riding. As such, you need to change the chainring of your bike after riding 6000 km.\nHow To Clean A Bike Chainset?\nSince regular cleaning can increase the durability of your bike’s chainset, you need to be aware of this. Many people explain this cleansing method in many ways. I will explain chainset cleaning in 7 simple steps.\nStep 1: Lift The Chain From The Chainring\nTo clean the chainset, first, lift the chain off the chainring and rest it on the frame just behind the gears. To do this, hold the chain up with your fingers and turn the pedals. And, this will give you access to clean all parts of the chainring and cassette. But It can take dirt on your clothes and body to complete the entire cleaning process.\nSo, wear old clothes and gloves to keep yourself clean.\nStep 2: Clean The Bits Of The Grime\nNow, clean the grime bits from the chain, chainring, and cassette using the tip of a knife or screwdriver. With prolonged use, you may notice a lot of buildups, especially on the chainring.\nThe tip of the screwdriver can play the most effective role in cleaning these. Because Grimes stuck in the rings also accumulate over time in cassettes and chains. So, carefully clean them from all places.\nStep 3: Wipe Down With A Soapy Brush\nUsing a brush, soak all areas of the dirty chainset with soapy water. You can also use any good cleaner instead of soap water. Be careful not to miss any parts while brushing. Turn the chainring, cassette, and chain over and wet all areas thoroughly.\nStep 4: Brush Well\nUsually, the dirt in the chainset sticks tightly. After soaking for some time, brush all the areas thoroughly. You can use wire brushes instead of ordinary brushes.\nSo, brush better if the dirt is not removed from any place.\nStep 5: Use Degreaser\nEven after brushing with soapy water, some dirt may remain. In addition, water-insoluble dirt can remain on the chainset. So, use a degreaser to remove these types of dirt.\nTake some amount of degreaser in a plastic disposable cup and rub it well using a paintbrush. Moreover, a stiff-bristled nylon brush will also work well in this case.\nStep 6: Rinse The Chainset With Water\nAfter removing dirt from the chainset using soapy water and degreaser, rinse thoroughly with water and dry. For quick drying, turn the pedal backward for 1 minute. But don’t forget to place the chain in the chainring before turning the pedals.\nStep 7: Apply The Lube\nAt last, wait for 5 to 10 minutes after the chainset dries and apply the lube.\nTake the lube in an applicator and apply it to the chain by turning the paddle backward.\nAnd, continue to apply on the same part of the chain two to three times until wet with lubricant. Although it’s difficult to keep it uninterrupted, try your best.\nAfter applying the lube, again continue to rotate the pedal backward at a moderate speed for 40 to 45 seconds. And, this will spread the lube all over the chainset.\nFinally, remove excess lube with a microfiber.\nHow To Remove Rust From Bike Chainring?\nRust can damage your bike’s chainrings quickly. So, take the initiative to remove any rust on the chainring as soon as possible. Although this rust can be a bit difficult to get rid of, here I will describe the easiest method. Just follow the steps below to eliminate rust from the chainring.\nStep 1: Remove The Chainring From The Bike\nYou can still remove rust from the chainring while it is attached to the bike, but it will be difficult in most cases. So first remove the chainring from the bike. Most companies usually attach chainrings to the crankset via bolts. Unscrew the bolts and separate the chainring from your bike.\nStep 2: Eliminate Surface Rust\nOnce you separate the chainring, you can see its entire surface. Now, keep wiping the rusted area using a cloth. Through this, you can remove the loose rusts.\nStep 3: Use Degreaser\nDegreaser will play the most effective role in removing rust from chainrings. You can use a commercial or a homemade degreaser made with vinegar and baking soda.\n- If the amount of rust is high, I would suggest you use a commercial degreaser. And, apply according to the instructions on the degreaser label.\nIn most cases, you may need to dip the chainring into it. So, follow the instructions on the degreaser label to know how long to soak.\nStep 4: Use A Metallic Bristle Brush\nAfter soaking for the allotted time, rub the chainring well with a metal bristle brush.\nAnd, keep scrubbing the rusted areas thoroughly until the rust is removed completely. If it is not possible to remove all the rust by soaking it once, soak it in a degreaser and rub it again with a brush.\nStep 5: Rinse The Chainring Perfectly\nOnce the rust gets removed, rinse the chainring thoroughly using clean water.\nHowever, warm soapy water is a more effective ingredient for washing it. And, you should wipe using a clean cloth and dry.\nStep 6: Apply Lubricant And Reattach The Chainring\nFinally, apply a suitable lubricant to the chainring after drying well.\nBecause the lubricant will help to lubricate the chainring as well as prevent rust. Then reattach the chainring to the proper position of the crankset.\nHow Do You Check Your Bike Chainring?\nAlthough regular chain changes help chainring last a long time, it needs routine checks from time to time. All you have to do is observe the teeth of the chainring.\n- Typically, when the chaining becomes old, the teeth decay and become smaller.\n- Also, the apex of the tooth erodes and becomes blunt at one stage as well.\n- But remember, some chainring teeth are already slightly smaller than others, which is a design.\nNonetheless, you will know your bike chainring is bad when the chain slips while riding the bike. If the chainsaws are damaged due to decay, you can usually notice decay in each of its teeth.\nWhen Should You Need To Replace Your Bike Chainrings?\nBike chainrings do not need to be changed very often. Here are some signs to know when it’s time to replace your bike’s chainring. Below, I’m describing the symptoms.\n- If the chainring breaks.\n- The teeth decay and become equal.\n- Chainrings become ancient.\n- The chain slips while riding the bike.\n- The shape of the chainring becomes distorted or crooked.\nHow To Replace Your Bikes Broken Chainring?\nReplacing a broken chainring of a bike is not a complicated task. And, you can do this yourself at home, which means it’s a DIY job, so save some money.\nYou just need very few tools to replace the chainring, most notably\n- a 5-millimeter Allen key,\n- and a special tool that prevents slipping when opening the chainring.\nNo worry, now I am going to describe the complete process in 4 steps that you can follow to change the chainring on a bike.\nStep 1: Remove The Chainring From The Crank\nMost bikes today usually have two (inner and outer) chainrings, connected by four different bolts. However, on more modern bikes, both chainsaws may be connected by the same (five) bolts. Anyway, first, you need to open the inner chainring.\n- Use the Allen key to loosen the bolts and separate the inner chainring.\n- Now open the outer chainring using the Allen key in the same way.\nIn this case, you may need to use the special tool on the reverse side of the bolt so that it does not slip. After that, remove the outer chainring after loosening the bolts.\nStep 2: Grease The Bolts\nThoroughly clean the bolts after opening the broken chainring. Thus you should use a degreaser to clean the bolts. Once cleaned, wipe the bolts well and apply good quality grease.\nUsing grease will make the bolts easier to stick and loosen later.\nStep 3: Measure The Bike Chainring\nWhen you buy chainrings, you must buy according to the previous chainring size. So, measure the distance of its bolt holes to measure the chainring.\n- If the distance and number of both bolt holes are correct, attach the new chainring.\nStep 4: Install The New Bike Chainring\nReassemble them in the same way you separated them to install chaining.\n- So, first, of the re-installation, put the outer chainring first and then the inner chainring.\n- If both chainrings need to be fastened with the same bolts, carefully attach the bolts to both chainring cranks by hand.\n- Finally, tighten the bolts properly using the Allen key.\nThen, How Often Do You Need To Replace Bike Chainrings?\nBike chainrings can last for a long time and if you are a regular rider, then change the chainring after every 6000 to 10000 kilometers of riding.\nAlthough there is a lot of disagreement on this, many recommend changing the chainring after 2,500 kilometers of riding.\nHowever, the time interval for changing chainrings depends a lot on the rider. Proper maintenance can greatly extend the duration of their use. Besides, it may need to be changed even after 2000 kilometers of riding because of your negligence.\nHow To Choose A Bike Chainset?\nDifferent types of chainsets are available in the market. depending on the bike and functionality, we see these different chainsets. So, any chainset may not be suitable for your bike. Below I am describing all the chainsets from which you can easily choose the chainset you need.\n1. Standard Chainset\nThe outer chaining of a standard chainset usually has 52 to 53 teeth. Also, the inner chainring has 39 teeth. These types of chainsets are most commonly used for road bikes. Many times, racers also prefer this type of chainset. If you are a casual rider, then you can choose a standard chainset for your bike.\n2. Compact Chainset\nA compact chainset has 50 teeth on the outer chainring and 34 teeth on the inner chainring. These types of chainrings are becoming increasingly popular because they are inner chainrings. These make it easier for you to climb higher ground. Because of the small number of teeth in the inner chainring, it creates less pressure on the rider’s knees and allows the rider to move freely.\n3. Single Speed Chainset\nYou can call this single-speed chainset – the old model. These types of chainsets have been used for a long time. These chainsets have two advantages.\nApparently, they are not likely to wear chains. On the other hand, these types of chainsets are more durable than others.\n4. Triple Speed Chainset\nTriple-speed chainsets are modern inventions. These chainsets have three chainrings with 50 teeth in the outer chainring, 39 teeth in the middle, and 30 teeth in the inner chainring.\nIf you ride a touring bike, these chainsets might be ideal for you. Because the smaller chainrings of these chainsets will give you more leverage when riding with heavy loads.\n- I hope, now you can easily select the chainset you need from the above four types of chainsets. As these are very important parts of a bike that can help you during the ride. So, choose a chainset considering your needs, road conditions, and bike type.\nAre Bike Chainrings Interchangeable?\nYes, you can interchange chainring on most of the bikes.\nBut, there are some older model bikes that have the chainring fixed to the crankset.\nAnd, to change these, you need to change the entire chainset. But the advantage is that today’s bikes do not use this type of chainset. You can easily change your bike chainring by yourself.\nThe Last Words\nSince bike chainrings are not universal, you can change them according to your needs and convenience. Furthermore, a compact chainring allows you to ride the bike faster. They can also reduce your exertion when you climb uphill.\nMoreover, a bike chainring replacement can cost you around $20 to $100. This means they are not cheap to work. So, they need regular maintenance.\nHere I have already discussed in detail the maintenance and replacement of the chainset. Hope this article helps you to make your chainrings identification, purchase the right one for your bike, and the replacing & installation process easier.","A bicycle chain is the central component of the drivetrain, so it's important to replace it when it gets worn. There's no set mileage limit on bike chains, but there are several common indicators that it's time to replace a bike chain, the most important being stretch. Environmental factors also play a part in how often a cyclist needs to replace a bike chain. If the bike chain is particularly worn or you've has been riding the bike for a long time without maintaining the chain, it might be necessary to replace other components of the bike too.\nNo Set Mileage\nThere's a lot of dispute among cyclists as to how long a chain can last, but most agree that a well-maintained chain can last for at least 1,000 miles (about 1,609 km). The environment that bike is ridden in plays a large part in how long a chain can last too. Chains ridden in gritty or wet environments tend to wear out faster than others, though proper maintenance can make them last longer. You can usually get a good idea of how often you'll need to replace the chain on a bike by keeping a record of your mileage between replacements.\nOne of the main warning signs that it's time to replace a bike chain is that the chain starts to slip when you put pressure on the pedals. Other indicators that you might need to replace a bike chain may be sloppy or slow shifting; mis-shifts, in which the chain does not move into the gear you want it to shift to; or dropping the chain — which occurs when the chain skips off the front chainrings and lands either on the frame or off the far side of the crankset.\nChecking for Stretch\nIf your bike chain starts showing signs of wear, you should check the chain to see if it's stretched. This happens when the pins holding the links of the chain get worn down, which allows the links to stretch out further than they're supposed to. You can check this with a chain gauge or just with a ruler. To do this with a ruler, you should hold a ruler above the chain with the zero mark at the middle of one of the pins. Then look 12 pins down — on an imperial units ruler, this should line up with an inch mark. If the center of the pin is more than 1/16th of an inch (about 1.58 mm) past the mark, you should consider replacing the chain; and if it's more than 1/8th of an inch (about 3.17 mm), you should certainly replace it.\nReplacing Other Parts\nIf you've been riding the bike for a long time without checking the bike chain, or if the chain is particularly worn, you should also check on the other parts of the drivetrain to make sure they're still OK. If you put a new bike chain on a very worn drivetrain, you could still run into shifting problems. Since the gears and chain are supposed to work in unison, if you put a new chain on a worn down cassette or freewheel, then the new chain won't line up properly with the old cogs. Additionally, old cogs can wear out a new chain more quickly than it should. If you replace your chain regularly, however, the cassette and chainrings or freewheel should last for much longer than the average chain."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3f7b28d0-2fa1-4f1d-abc3-ccb6d5a06be8>","<urn:uuid:1e6c8e55-563a-4b21-99e8-ea43c7448095>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm researching DNA editing technology - how does the new iCas protein work to control DNA modifications?","answer":"The iCas protein works like a light switch that can be controlled using tamoxifen, a drug commonly used to treat breast cancer. When tamoxifen is absent, iCas remains switched off and makes no changes to the DNA. When tamoxifen is introduced, iCas activates and edits the target DNA site. This system provides tight regulation of DNA editing activity and outperforms other chemical-inducible CRISPR-Cas technologies with faster response time and the ability to be switched on and off repeatedly.","context":["The ability to alter DNA accurately will open more doors in the development of personalised medicine that could help to tackle human diseases that currently have few treatment options. Examples of diseases that have unmet therapeutic needs include neurodegenerative diseases like Huntington’s disease, muscular dystrophies, and blood disorders like sickle cell anemia.\nThis new protein, named iCas, can be easily controlled by an external chemical input and thus solves some of the problems with CRISPR-Cas1, the existing gold-standard for DNA altering. For example, existing Cas enzymes may sometimes alter places in the DNA that result in dire consequences. With iCas, users now have the ability to control enzyme activity and thus minimize unintended DNA modifications in the cell.\nDeveloped by a collaboration between A*STAR’s Genome Institute of Singapore (GIS) and Nanyang Technological University, Singapore (NTU Singapore), iCas was published in the peer reviewed scientific journal Nature Chemical Biology this week.\nLeading the joint research team is Dr Tan Meng How, Senior Research Scientist of Stem Cell Regenerative Biology at the GIS, and Assistant Professor at NTU’s School of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering.\n“DNA is like an instruction manual that tells living cells how to behave, so if we can rewrite the instructions in this manual, we will be able to gain control over what the cells are supposed to do,” explained Dr Tan. “Our engineered iCas protein is like a light switch that can be readily turned on and off as desired. It also outperforms other existing methods in terms of response time and reliability.”\nHow DNA altering works\nTo ensure that DNA is precisely altered, which is required in many biomedical and biotechnological applications, the activity of the Cas protein must be tightly regulated.\nThe chemical that switches the iCas protein on or off is tamoxifen, a drug commonly used to treat and prevent breast cancer. In its absence, iCas is switched off with no changes made to the DNA. When switched on with tamoxifen, iCas will then edit the target DNA site.\nIn the study, iCas was found to outperform other chemical-inducible CRISPR-Cas technologies, with a much faster response time and an ability to be switched on and off repeatedly.\nThe higher speed at which iCas reacts will enable tighter control over exactly where and when DNA editing takes place. This is useful in research or applications that demand precise control of DNA editing.\nFor example, in studies of cell signalling pathways or vertebrate development, iCas can precisely target a subset of cells within a tissue (spatial control) or to edit the DNA at a particular developmental stage (temporal control).\n“The iCas technology developed by Dr Tan is an exciting addition to the growing CRISPR toolbox. It enables genome editing in a precisely controlled manner, thus opening new doors for applications of the CRISPR technology in basic and applied biological research,” said Dr Huimin Zhao, the Steven L. Miller Chair Professor of the Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering faculty at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).\nGIS Executive Director Prof Ng Huck Hui added, “This development allows the researchers to have precision control for more accurate DNA editing, and it can help researchers engineer cells with new properties or repair diseased cells with mutated DNA.”\nProf Teoh Swee Hin, Chair of NTU’s School of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, said, “DNA editing is an exciting field with many potential uses in the treatment of diseases. NTU has been active in research in the area of gene sequencing and bioengineering over the past years and this work by Dr Tan and his Singapore team will add to the growing body of knowledge in cell engineering for medicine.”\n1The CRISPR-Cas (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats and CRISPR-associated proteins) system is a powerful technology that can be used to manipulate the DNA in living cells. For instance, it can be used to correct disease-causing mutations in humans or to engineer improved agricultural crops with desirable traits to ensure food security."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:219858ab-02ad-499c-ad07-f9484cda26ad>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does recycling paper impact tree conservation and water resources?","answer":"Recycling one ton of paper has significant environmental benefits across multiple resources. It saves 17 trees and 7,000 gallons of water. Additionally, recycling paper provides substantial energy savings, as recycling newspaper requires only 10 Million BTU compared to 30 Million BTU needed for manufacturing from raw materials. This is particularly important since Americans, while representing only 5% of the world's population, generate 30% of the world's garbage.","context":["The Power of Recycling: A Balanced Viewpoint for Young Environmentalists\nThe topic of recycling is buzzing all over the world. It's even more relevant for the younger generation as they are the custodians of Earth's future. This article aims to provide an objective and comprehensive overview of recycling, its benefits, and its limitations.\nWhat is Recycling, and Why Does It Matter?\nRecycling is the process of converting waste materials into reusable materials and objects. It's all about taking items that would otherwise end up in a landfill and turning them into something new and useful. You can learn more about the recycling process here.\nRecycling is not just about being eco-friendly; it's also about preserving resources, saving energy, and reducing pollution. With the increasing global population and our consumption habits, we are putting immense pressure on our planet's natural resources. Recycling can help mitigate this problem.\nThe Benefits of Recycling\n1. Conservation of Natural Resources\nRecycling helps conserve natural resources. For example, by recycling paper, we save trees, and by recycling plastic, we reduce the need for petroleum, which is used to make new plastic. In fact, recycling one ton of paper saves 17 trees and 7,000 gallons of water source.\n2. Energy Efficiency\nRecycling is generally more energy-efficient than producing new products from raw materials. For instance, recycling aluminum cans saves 95% of the energy needed to produce new ones from raw materials source.\n3. Reduction of Landfills\nRecycling reduces the amount of waste that ends up in landfills. Landfills are not only visually unappealing but also cause environmental problems such as soil, air, and water pollution. They produce methane, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming.\n4. Job Creation\nThe recycling industry creates jobs. A study by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found that recycling and reuse activities in the United States created 757,000 jobs in 2007 source.\nLimitations of Recycling\nWhile recycling has its benefits, it isn't always the best option. Let's look at some of the limitations.\n1. Not All Materials are Recyclable\nUnfortunately, not all materials can be recycled. For instance, materials like plastic bags, polystyrene foam (Styrofoam), and certain types of glass cannot be recycled in most locations.\nRecycling can be less effective if the recyclable materials are contaminated. This happens when non-recyclable items are mixed with recyclable ones, or when food or other waste contaminates recyclable materials. This contamination can make the entire batch of recyclables unusable source.\n3. Energy and Pollution\nWhile recycling is generally more energy-efficient than producing new products, it still uses energy and can create pollution. For example, the process of recycling paper can release harmful chemicals into the environment.\n4. Financial Cost\nRecycling can be expensive. It requires collection, sorting, and processing, all of which cost money. In some cases, it can be cheaper to produce new products from raw materials than to recycle.\nBalancing Recycling with Other Environmental Practices\nConsidering the limitations of recycling, it's crucial to balance it with other environmental practices. Remember the famous three R’s: Reduce, Reuse, and Recycle. They're listed in order of importance.\nThe most effective way to minimize waste is not to create it in the first place. For example, you might choose to buy fewer items with excessive packaging, bring your own reusable shopping bags, water bottles, and coffee cups, or borrow or rent items you'll only use once or twice.\nBefore you recycle or dispose of anything, consider whether it has more life left in it. A used glass jar can become a new storage container. An old t-shirt can become a cleaning rag. Items in good condition can be donated or sold for reuse.\nIf you can't reduce or reuse, then recycling is the next best thing. Even with its limitations, recycling is still far better for the environment than sending waste to the landfill.\nMaking Recycling More Effective\nSo how can we ensure that recycling is as effective as possible? Here are a few tips:\n1. Know What to Recycle\nLearn what materials are recyclable in your community and make sure you're recycling the right things. Here is a useful guide to help you.\n2. Clean Your Recyclables\nRinse out containers to remove food and drink residue before recycling. This helps prevent contamination that can make other items non-recyclable.\n3. Don't Wish-Cycle\n\"Wish-cycling\" is when you're not sure if something is recyclable, but you put it in the recycling bin anyway, hoping it is. This can lead to contamination, so when in doubt, find out!\nAs young environmentalists, you hold the power to make a difference in the world. While recycling has its limitations, it's still a crucial tool in our fight against waste and our journey towards a more sustainable future. By understanding the benefits and challenges of recycling, as well as the importance of reducing and reusing, you can help create a healthier planet for everyone.\nRemember, every action counts, no matter how small. So, keep learning, stay curious, and continue to care about our Earth. Your actions today will shape the world of tomorrow.\nWhile I've tried to provide comprehensive information, the topic of recycling is complex and varies greatly by location and other factors. So, keep exploring, asking questions, and seeking knowledge. A wealth of resources is available out there, like the EPA's resources for students and educators and National Geographic Kids.\nRemember, you have the power to make a difference! Happy recycling!","Reducing waste, reusing materials and products, and recycling are some of the most powerful ways individuals, households, and businesses can protect the environment.\nHere's why you should get involved:\n- Saving natural resources: Reusing discarded products and using recycled materials to make new products reduces the use of virgin materials, which often involves harvesting trees and mining the earth. Even better, “source reducing” waste — or avoiding the generation of discards in the first place — saves the most resources of all.\n- Preventing environmental problems that come from landfills: Few people want a landfill in their neighborhood. Unfortunately, we will need landfills as long as we choose to dispose of waste. Although landfills today are much safer than 20 years ago, they are still a poor use of land and a potential source of groundwater contamination and releases of methane and other gases.\n- Saving energy: Enormous amounts of energy are required to make products and materials worldwide. Energy is saved by not using products and materials when at all possible, or by reusing products in their current form. Tremendous energy savings come from using recycled instead of virgin materials in manufacturing.\n- Preventing pollution: Almost all manufacturing processes use water and release wastewater and air emissions into the environment. Reducing and reusing products cuts down on manufacturing pollution, just as the use of recycled instead of virgin materials prevents pollution in industrial processes.\n- Saving money: Households can save money by reusing materials and products and by practicing smart shopping habits that reduce waste.\nReducing the amount of waste you generate is a great step to take towards helping the environment. There are several things that you\n- Use tote bags or bins when shopping, say no to the plastic shopping bag.\n- Select packaging that does not have a lot of excess waste.\n- Use dinnerware that can be washed instead of paper plates and plastic ware.\n- Only buy things that you will use in the immediate future.\nMany commonly discarded items — from single-sided paper to clothing to televisions — are readily reusable in their current form.\nInstead of tossing an item in the trash can or recycling bin, consider ways it might still be usable to you or someone else, or whether it can be repaired if needed.\nGive your discards a chance at a second life by holding a yard sale or donating items to Goodwill, the Salvation Army, Habitat for Humanity, or other charitable outlets. Contact schools and nursery schools to find out different types of items they reuse for art projects. Donate used books to the Library. Several organizations take used cars and even boats.\nThe energy used to manufacture a product is a direct energy cost. But there are indirect energy costs, too. The energy used to obtain raw materials -- for transportation, distribution and even disposal of an item -- contributes to indirect energy costs.\nDirect and indirect energy costs are referred to as embedded energy -- the total amount of energy a product used in its “life.” Both direct and indirect energy cost can be reduced through recycling.\nTable Comparing Energy Cost of Manufacturing Products from Raw materials vs. Recycled materials:\n|NEWSPRINT||30 Million BTU||10 Million BTU|\n|PET PLASTIC||98 Million BTU||12 Million BTU|\n|HDPE PLASTIC||98 Million BTU||22 Million BTU|\n|GLASS||16 Million BTU||15 Million BTU|\n|METALS|| Aluminum from Ore|\n250 Million BTU\n| Aluminum from Scrap|\n12.5 Million BTU\nSOURCE: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s “Municipal Solid Waste in the United States: 2005 Facts and Figures”\nWhat can I recycle? Many materials can be recycled. Some of the most common are:\nNewspaper Aluminum Cans\nCardboard Steel Cans\nWriting/Copy Paper Plastic Bottles\nMixed Household Paper Glass Bottles and Jars\nMagazines End of Life Electronics\n- Americans represent only five percent of the world's population, but generate 30 percent of the world's garbage.\n- Recycling one ton of old paper saves 17 trees; 2 barrels of oil (enough to run an average car for 1,260 miles); 4,100 kilowatts of energy (enough power for the average home for 6 months); 3.2 cubic yards of landfill space; 7,000 gallons of wate; and 60 pounds of air pollution.\n- Every day, U.S. paper makers recycle enough paper to fill a train of boxcars 15 miles long.\n- If we recycled all of the newspapers printed in the U.S. on a typical Sunday, we would save about 550,000 trees.\n- Recycling the steel from six cars can provide enough steel framing for a 2000 square foot building.\n- The energy saved each year by steel recycling is equal to the electrical power used by 18 million homes each year -- or enough energy to last Irondequoit residents eight hundred years!\n- The steel industry recycles almost 19 billion steel cans into new products each year – about 600 cans recycled every second.\n- Recycling one aluminum can saves enough energy to power a television for three hours.\n- Americans throw away enough aluminum to rebuild our entire commercial fleet of airplanes every 3 months.\n- Aluminum cans produced in the United States can contain at least 50 percent recycled content.\n- Recycling one glass bottle saves enough electricity to light a 60-watt bulb for four hours.\n- If not recycled, one quart of used motor oil could pollute 250,000 gallons of drinking water.\n- Half of all polyester carpet made in the United States is made from recycled plastic (PT).\n- Energy saved from recycling helps the environment by reducing energy-related air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.\nRemember - Recycle Today for Tomorrow !\n- Buy recycled products. If we want recycling to work, we must support manufacturers who use recycled materials in their products (post-consumer recycled content) -- whether in the products themselves or the packages they come in. Favor products with a high recycled content, even if they cost a little more. Look to buy more durable, less toxic and products with less packaging. Also, buy only what you need and use what you buy.\n- Consider packaging. Buy products that use less unnecessary packaging or packaging that can be recycled. If you really like or need a certain product with excess packaging contact the manufacturer and suggest that they use less packaging or recyclable packaging.\n- Use Common Services: for example, using the library instead of buying books, or renting tools instead of buying them.\nBuy to reduce waste. Buy in bulk, buy items in recyclable packaging, and avoid disposable items. Use your own reusable canvas bag when you shop.\nMake recycling an everyday activity. Encourage everyone you know to recycle. Share with others. Before throwing away unwanted, but still good, items, check with charitable organizations. Perhaps someone in need could be helped by what might have been trash."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5a5c96df-5f94-4bde-a88f-bf4f0478a151>","<urn:uuid:e3b8ff9f-5ac4-494f-bf73-84bd99cb53fa>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How can the area of an entire country be calculated despite its complex shape?","answer":"The area of a country can be calculated by dividing it into lots of small triangles and adding up their individual areas. While this might seem complicated, modern computing can perform this calculation very quickly using satellite images.","context":["2.2 Calculating areas\nLast week you discussed the SI unit for measuring length, the metre. In fact, you also discussed areas without paying too much attention to them – the area of the Earth, or of Alaska, for example. So, let’s talk more about areas and how to calculate them.\nThe areas of shapes like rectangles (and squares, which are a special type of rectangle) can be worked out by simply multiplying the two side lengths together. A rectangular room that is 3 metres long by 4 metres wide has an area of 3 multiplied by 4. The units for area are simply metres multiplied by metres, or as it is normally written, m2 (pronounced ‘metres squared’). So the area of the room is 12 m2, or twelve square metres.\nAreas of squares and rectangles are fairly easy, but what about other shapes? It turns out that for a lot of simple shapes, there are some very simple methods that have already been shown to work. You can make a triangle by folding a square down the diagonal between two opposite corners. This square has an area of 4 m × 4 m = 16 m2 so each of the triangles is half that area or 8 m2.\nAll triangles can be split by a line that makes the two parts either half of a square or rectangle, or one of each.\nSince the area of each smaller triangle is easy to work out, being half of the ‘whole’ rectangle or square, the area of the larger triangle is also easy to work out, as it is just those two areas added together. If you are thinking ahead, you will have worked out that the end result of this is the same as multiplying the total base (3+5) by the height (4) and dividing that answer in half. So the area of a triangle is half of the base times the height.\nCircles are a bit different but have their own method. The distance across a circle is called the diameter. Half of the diameter is the radius. The distance around the outside of a circle is called the circumference.\nThe circumference of any circle is always 3.14 times its diameter … well roughly that. It is actually an unending string of numbers after the decimal point: 3.141592653589793238462643383279502884197169399375105820974944 … . It has so many numbers in it that we make life easier by giving it a name instead. We call it pi, which is a Greek letter that is often written as π.\nThe rule for working out the area of a circle is pi times the radius times the radius, or πr2. So, if the circle is 4 metres across (i.e. the radius is 2 metres), then the area is roughly 12.5 m2.\nIf you want to calculate the area of a country, you might think it is a horribly complicated process with all kinds of complex maths, but it can be done with a very simple, albeit long-winded method. All you need to do is divide the country into lots of small triangles and work out the total of all of their individual areas. Modern computing can do this in the blink of an eye from satellite images."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:094122ca-226e-4f36-bc6e-09a0c51279ef>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between the immediate physical warning signs of potential damage from using a percussion massage device versus exposure to dangerous noise levels?","answer":"For percussion massage devices, the warning signs are primarily related to muscle soreness and physical discomfort, which can be adjusted by changing the device's stroke rate and force settings. In contrast, dangerous noise exposure has distinct warning signs including immediate pain in the ears after leaving a noisy area, sudden ringing or buzzing (tinnitus) in the ears, and difficulty understanding speech while still being able to hear people talking. The massage guns' effects are generally temporary and adjustable through different speed settings (ranging from 1800 to 3200 percussions per minute), while noise-induced hearing damage can be permanent and irreversible, particularly affecting the delicate hair cells in the inner ear that allow us to hear higher-frequency sounds.","context":["- Portable massage guns are a go-to recovery tool to relieve sore muscles.\n- The best at-home massage guns should be easy to use, sufficiently powered for muscle relief, lightweight, and quiet.\n- The Theragun Pro is our top pick, featuring a rotating arm for multiple massage angles and customized speed options.\nNo matter your preferred method of keeping fit, be it running, lifting weights, or anything else, it's natural to experience muscle soreness. This pain may affect your training and can even cause you to take some unplanned days off. While it's important to rest your muscles, you can also find relief by using a massage gun to loosen up and get the blood flowing to your problem areas.\nA massage gun works by pounding your muscles at a rate of up to 4,000 times per minute. The depth of the stroke (called a percussion) and the amount of force it exerts determines how powerful the massage gun feels. More muscular people who prefer hard massages should look for a massage gun with a higher stroke rate, more percussions per minute, and more force. If you're more sensitive, then a lighter-duty massager will suffice.\nMassage guns are essential for athletes and can be helpful if you regularly push yourself to achieve new fitness goals. For instance, they can help warm up your muscles before an early morning run or keep them from tightening up when you're finished. Though their many purposes vary, massage guns all point to a core result: Relief and recovery.\nWe tested a selection of them from brands like Theragun, Hyperice, and Vybe to find the best of the best. Our guide features massagers that not only help you warm up for and recover from your workouts but also have useful features that justify their price. At the end of this guide, we've included some insight into how we tested each of the massage guns, as well as what else we tested for inclusion.\nHere are the best massage guns of 2021\nThe best overall\nThe Theragun Pro is our top pick: a powerful, customizable, and durable massager that's worth every bit of its $600 price tag.\nPros: Two-year warranty; adjustable massage arm, customizable speeds; 60 lbs of no-stall force; easy to control and use; comes with six different heads, an extra battery, and a carrying case\nThe professional-grade Theragun Pro stands out from the rest with its superior performance in a premium package. And, it's speed settings are customizable, allowing you to dial in exactly the percussion per minute that you want with various massage heads.\nIt also has a long-lasting battery life (and comes with two batteries), so your 60 lb. gun can dig into deeper muscles for a good while.\nWhat makes the Pro especially attractive is Theragun's introduction of QuietForce Technology, a feature that makes the operation of the gun far quieter than any previous massage gun in the brand's lineup. It's still pretty loud, don't get us wrong, but it's noticeably quieter than earlier models.\nOther features include a built-in OLED screen (which displays the current PPM, a real-time force meter, and battery life), and a rotating massage head. If it's professional-grade relief you seek, the aptly named Pro is your best bet. -- Rick Stella, Health & Fitness Editor.$599.00 from Amazon $599.00 from Nordstrom $599.00 from Therabody $599.00 from Bloomingdale's\nThe best low volume\nThe Hyperice Hypervolt Vibration Massage Device runs quietly yet can work for up to three hours at 3200 percussions per minute.\nPros: Quiet, come with four head attachments, three speeds up to 3200 percussions per minute, lightweight, comes with carrying case, long battery runtime\nCons: Massage arm doesn't rotate, only one place to grip the unit, slightly confusing to use at first\nThe Hyperice Hypervolt Vibration Massage Device is exceptional because it runs quietly — 54 decibels on its highest, loudest setting — and has a battery runtime of three hours. The battery is also detachable, so if three hours isn't long enough, you can buy extras on the Hyperice site to keep your sessions going.\nIt comes with four separate head attachments: fork, bullet, flat, and round. Everything fits into a handy carrying case, which along with the device's 2.4-pound weight, makes it easy to transport. There are three speed settings — 1800, 2400, and 3200 percussions per minute — so you're sure to find the right speed for your problem areas.\nThe biggest drawback is that the two power buttons are somewhat confusing at first, and you can only hold the unit in one place, as opposed to the three grips of Theragun's massagers. But, while testing the Hypervolt, I was impressed with how well it worked out my knots. I found it warmed up my legs well before my early-morning runs. The grip felt comfortable in my hand without ever getting too heavy as well.$249.00 from Best Buy\nThe best low-intensity\nTherabody's fourth generation of massage guns introduced the Theragun Mini, a portable device that packs a percussive punch in a much smaller package.\nPros: Affordable, offers the same PPMs as Theragun's more advanced models, portable\nCons: Only offers 20 pounds of no-stall force, won't help with deep tissue work\nThe Theragun Mini is Therabody's first portable massage gun, making muscle relief much more convenient.\nShaped like the spade you'd see in a deck of cards, the Mini fits in just one hand and offers a similar amount of percussions per minute (PPMs) as its more advanced kin. This allows it to deliver worthy massages perfect for quickly warming up before a run or relieving tight spots.\nThe main difference between the Mini and the more advanced Theragun models is how much no-stall force it's able to dole out. Whereas devices like the Pro or Elite are capable of 60 and 40 pounds, respectively, the Mini only touts a 20-pound threshold.\nFor deeper tissue massages, the Mini might not suffice. But Therabody didn't introduce it to satisfy that need. It's an on-the-go solution that bridges the gap between more advanced massages (or more advanced massage guns).\nAt $199, it's also the cheapest massage gun in its lineup and one that's entirely worth the investment — even for people who don't previously own a massage gun. Think of it as a suitable entry-level massage device. -- Rick Stella, Health & Fitness Editor.$199.00 from Nordstrom $199.00 from Therabody $199.00 from Dick's Sporting Goods\nThe best high-intensity\nIf you're someone who's always asking the massage therapist to go harder, the TimTam Power Massager is your best option.\nPros: Extremely powerful, features an adjustable arm, the battery is swappable, comes with a carrying case, delivers deep stroke length\nCons: Loud, might be too intense for some, short battery runtime\nThe TimTam Power Massager is simply \"powerful\": It offers one speed — 2500 strokes per minute — and the stroke depth is roughly one inch deeper than any other massager on our list. Though it only has one handle, the arm rotates 90 degrees to make it easier to work hard-to-reach areas. And, at 2.1 pounds, it's incredibly light.\nAccording to the manufacturer, the battery runtime is only 60 minutes per charge but it's removable, so you can buy additional batteries on the TimTam website. The site also has an array of heads you can pick up if the ball tip is not enough for your needs.$249.00 from Amazon $249.00 from Walmart\nThe best on a budget\nThe Vybe Premium Percussion Massage Gun has five speeds and runs for up to four hours on a single charge, and it cuts the price of other massagers in half.\nPros: Affordable, runs quietly, four-hour battery runtime, comes with four massage heads and a carrying case, five speeds\nCons: The massager's arm doesn't adjust, built-in battery\nFor its price point, the Vybe Premium Percussion Massage Gun has some impressive specs. In addition to its five speeds capable of pumping out 3200 percussions per minute, it comes with a travel case and weighs only 2.2 pounds, making it portable and easy to hold for long periods. It also has an impressive four-hour battery run time and an ergonomic design allowing for multiple grips.\nThe percussions are approximately 10 mm deep and have a force of 30 pounds, which isn't outstanding but should be able to work out most knots relatively quickly.\nThe Vybe Pro Premium comes with four head attachments - bullet head, flat head, fork, and large ball – that can accommodate specific muscle groups. It utilizes a brushless motor, which allows it to run quietly, too. The estimated noise level is anywhere from 50 to 60 decibels.$169.99 from Amazon\nWhat else we tested\nWhile researching this guide, we tested countless massage guns. There were a few that barely missed the cut. Here are the six we almost included:\nDrum Massage Gun: While our review of this product proves it's effective and worth the money (thanks to its four speed settings that are all incredibly quiet), it didn't quite measure up to our other picks because it's heavy to carry.\nTheragun liv: There's a lot to like about Theragun's lowest priced option. Unlike its more expensive models, the liv only comes with two head attachments, one speed, and doesn't have as nice of a carrying case. However, it still packs 2400 percussions per second and has three grippy ergonomic handles. I've tested this gun personally and found it gets the job done but the extra heads are missed and I'd prefer a removable battery.\nWahl Deep Tissue Percussion Massager: Calling this a \"massage gun\" is a bit of a stretch, but it essentially performs the same functions as the aforementioned devices. It's an excellent solution if you have a limited budget, too. It comes with four attachment heads and has variable percussion speeds ranging from 2,000 to 3,350 strokes per minute. The biggest negative is that it isn't cordless and the power cable is only nine feet long.\nTimTam PowerMassager Pro: TimTam's top-of-the-line model is unique in that it has a heated tip that offers an added therapeutic touch to its deep tissue relief. The massage arm has 175 degrees of rotation, three speeds (1000, 2000, and 2800 strokes per minute), and a deep stroke length of 32 mm. We chose not to include it in our guide because of the high price. We think the G3 and Hypervolt provide better value.\nAccugun Quiet Pro: Flyby, the makers of the Accugun, claim that the Quiet Pro is quieter, lighter, and runs longer on a single charge than any of the guns sold by Theragun, Hyperice, or Vybe. It also comes with six head attachments and features three speed settings. It's also backed by a one-year warranty. However, the Quiet Pro only has one handle, and the arm doesn't adjust so you may experience arm fatigue during longer massages.\nElecForU Carrying Case Massage Gun: This massage gun comes with six heads for targeted relief. It features a brushless motor, which allows for quiet operation, and there are five speeds ranging from 1200 to 3600 strokes per minute. According to the manufacturer, the battery runtime is an outstanding 4 hours. The biggest negatives are that it weighs more than three pounds and only has one handle.\nHow we test massage guns\nWhen we get a massage gun to test, there are a few features and performance metrics we look for:\nLoudness: If your gun is too loud, it makes enjoying your favorite TV show difficult and may annoy others. I hold a sound meter 12 inches away from the massage gun while it's at its highest speed to gauge loudness. If quietness is important to you, look for one that's under 60 decibels.\nPercussions: This includes percussions or strokes per minute, how deep the strokes are, and if the speeds are adjustable. You may find different speeds feel better on different body parts. And, stroke depth generally correlates with how \"hard\" the massage feels.\nEase of use: Several characteristics make a massager easy to use, including weight, number of handles, how comfortable the handles feel, whether the massage arm the heads attach to is adjustable, and if the controls are intuitive.\nBattery: You don't want a gun's battery dying in the middle of a session, and you also want it to be ready to go for your massage., Look for a massage gun with a long battery runtime, along with swappable batteries so you can have a backup if one dies.\nAccessories: Round hard foam heads come standard with most massage guns. The better options also come with other head attachments for working different body parts. For instance, if you plan on working small muscle groups, a cone or pointy head is useful. A carrying case for your gun and accessories is also a must if you travel often.\nSign up for Insider Reviews' weekly newsletter for more buying advice and great deals.\nYou can purchase syndication rights to this story here.\nDisclosure: This post is brought to you by the Insider Reviews team.

Packing earplugs along with the sunscreen for summer outings is just one of six easy tips that BHI is offering.\nWhile many noisy recreational activities are part of summer fun, it’s extremely important to take precautions to ensure that these activities don’t harm our hearing.\nProlonged exposure to loud outdoor concerts, lawn mowers, power tools, motorized recreational vehicles, target shooting, sporting events and fireworks can potentially damage our ears. In fact, the single bang of a firecracker at close range can cause permanent hearing loss in an instant, making it forever more difficult to hear the quieter sounds of summer.\nAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), 1.1 billion teenagers and young adults (12 to 35 year olds) are at risk of hearing loss due to exposure to damaging levels of sound at noisy entertainment venues and the unsafe use of personal audio devices.\n“Hearing is the sense that connects us to each other,” says William Hal Martin, Ph.D., Professor of Otolaryngology, National University of Singapore, Program Director MSc of Audiology, Center for Hearing, Speech & Balance, and Co-Director of Dangerous Decibels. “Exposure to high level sounds cannot only destroy our ability to hear, it can cause tinnitus—ringing in the ears.”\n“People of all ages are at risk of hearing loss from high level sounds, but it easily can be prevented by simple steps,” Martin continues. “It is important to recognize when your ears are in danger and to safeguard them so you can enjoy listening to friends, music, and sounds you love for the rest of your life.”\nHow Noise Affects Our Hearing\nWe hear sound when delicate hair cells in our inner ear vibrate, creating nerve signals that the brain understands as sound. But just as we can overload an electrical circuit, we also can overload these vibrating hair cells. Loud noise damages these delicate hair cells, resulting in sensorineural hearing loss and often tinnitus (ringing in the ears). The cells that are the first to be damaged or die are those that vibrate most quickly—those that allow us to hear higher-frequency sounds clearly, like the sounds of birds singing and children speaking.\nSound volume is measured in decibels, with the softest sound a normal hearing human can hear measuring at 0 dBA. Any sounds above 85 dBA for 8 or more hours are considered unsafe. Most firecrackers produce sounds starting at 125 dB peak SPL, presenting the risk of irreversible ear damage.\nRepeated exposure to loud noise, over an extended period of time, presents serious risks to hearing health as well. If you have to shout over the noise to be heard by someone within arm’s length, the noise is probably in the dangerous range. Here are the warning signs:\nYou have pain in your ears after leaving a noisy area.\nYou hear ringing or buzzing (tinnitus) in your ears immediately after exposure to noise.\nYou suddenly have difficulty understanding speech after exposure to noise; you can hear people talking but can’t understand them.\nFor more information on hearing loss and to take the free, confidential, online BHI Hearing Check, visit www.BetterHearing.org.

If a loud noise takes you by surprise, quickly plug your ears with your fingers and walk away. Increasing the distance between you and the source of the sound will help reduce the intensity (or decibels) at which the sound is reaching your ears.\nUse earplugs. When you know you’ll be around loud sounds, use earplugs. Disposable earplugs, made of foam or silicone, are often available at local pharmacies. They’re practical because you can still hear music and conversation when they’re in your ears. But when they fit snuggly, they’re effective in adequately blocking out dangerously loud sounds.\nLeave the fireworks to the professionals. Be smart when you celebrate 4th of July festivities. Leave the fireworks to the professionals. And when watching the show, stay a safe distance away—where you can enjoy the colors and lights but not expose yourself and your family to loud noises. To protect your hearing, make sure you’re wearing earplugs and that they’re securely in place before the show begins. Also be sure to keep them in for the entire show.\nLimit your time in noisy environments. Do all you can to limit the length of time you spend in a noisy environment. When you do participate in noisy activities, alternate them with periods of quiet. And remember to use ear protection.\nTurn it down. When listening to smartphones and other electronics, keep them at a low volume. Importantly, limit your use of headphones and ear buds. Remember, it’s not just the volume that matters. It’s also the duration of time spent listening.\nVisit your local hearing healthcare professional for custom-fitted ear protection and a hearing test. A hearing healthcare professional can provide a hearing test to determine your baseline hearing level and determine if you have any hearing loss that should be addressed. Hearing care professionals also can provide custom ear protection to ensure a proper fit."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"sensitive"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5f42c9fd-8814-4eb4-aa11-ada65824a23f>","<urn:uuid:38a46781-e96f-4116-b1d0-4aad90c3d5bb>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm considering different model airplane covering materials for my first build. How do plastic films like MonoKote compare to fabric coverings in terms of weight and ease of application?","answer":"Plastic films (heat-shrink coverings) and fabric coverings have distinct characteristics. Plastic films like MonoKote weigh between 1.685 to 2.700 ounces per square yard, while fabric coverings are slightly heavier at 2.9 to 3.3 ounces per square yard. Plastic films are easier to apply - they simply require heat to activate the adhesive layer and then heat to shrink tight. MonoKote specifically offers a high-gloss, smooth finish and is long-lasting. Fabric coverings, while producing a very realistic finish, require a specific application process where you roll out and apply the material, then iron on at low heat to activate the adhesive. Both materials can be used on foam structures, though fabric coverings specifically require low-heat application.","context":["For many reasons, heat-shrink plastic films are easily the most popular way to cover a model airplane. They’re easy to apply and come in just about every color imaginable; they’re odorless, non-toxic and almost completely fuel-proof. It’s easy to achieve a great-looking model without a lot of effort; you only need to know the basics of surface preparation and how to plan ahead, and you need the proper tools. Top Flite MonoKote was one of the first plastic films on the market; I’ve used it for years with great results, and I used it for this article.\n(Above) Basic supplies and tools for a great finish.\n1. For this model, I chose a simple, two-color scheme and used a variety of tools: a sanding block with various grits of sandpaper and a new knife with fresh blades. Speaking of blades, always use a new one for any trimming; nothing is worse than having a dull blade snag and tear the covering. Other necessary tools are a heat gun, an iron, a trim iron, a metal straightedge, Coverite Balsarite, a tack cloth and covering material.\n2. Before I even plug in the iron, I inspect all of the parts for any humps, bumps, dings and dents. They must all be removed because plastic film shows nearly every imperfection on the part being covered. Wherever possible, I use a sanding block. I start by sanding with 150-grit sandpaper and then progress to finer grits. I try to get the balsa as smooth as possible because the smoother the surface, the better the results.\n3. Before completing the final sanding, I apply a coat of Balsarite to help seal and toughen the wood. The Balsarite also raises more wood fibers and, in my opinion, it makes final sanding easier with better results. (This is just my preference; you can skip it if you want.) For final sanding, I use a sanding block with 400-grit paper and then progress to 600-grit. I sand the entire airframe; when finished, the airframe should feel like silk when you glide your fingers over it.\n4. Don’t skip this step; it’s as important as the final sanding: vacuum all the airframe’s nooks and crannies to remove all the dust and debris that always seem to collect. Now give the model a good rubdown with a tack cloth to remove any particles you missed. Remember: the better the finish underneath, the better the final result.\nBefore you start to cut the covering, you need to plan your trim scheme and determine the sequence for laying down the material. Just as when you paint, you should apply the lightest colors first. On this model, I decided to use two colors for the wing and fuselage. I began by covering the larger areas first and saved the scrap for smaller jobs. I usually start with the bottom of the wing. Using a new blade, I cut the material slightly larger than the area to be covered. With a hot iron (follow the manufacturer’s recommendations for heat), tack the material in the middle of the leading edge (LE) and then pull it taut and tack it to the trailing edge (TE). Now grab the material, pull it taut and tack it to the LE of the wing root. Do the same for the TE wing root and at the wingtip rib. Continue tacking and pulling out wrinkles on both the LE and TE until both have been completely sealed. I also completely seal both the root and tip ribs. The idea is to get the covering as tight as possible before shrinking it.\n6. When using a heat gun, I usually wear a glove to avoid burning my fingers, as the temperatures can be quite high. I start shrinking the material in the middle of the panel and work toward each end. I also pull on the excess material on the LE and TE to prevent the seams from loosening and pulling in. Use caution with the heat gun; keep it moving, or you’ll risk burning a hole in the material.\nAfter the shrinking has been completed, it’s time to trim away the excess material. Be sure to use a fresh blade for trimming. For best results, I pull the excess material taut and smoothly glide the blade along the edge in one motion. For long, straight cuts, I use the metal straightedge; be certain not to cut into the wood below and possibly weaken it. Above left: here’s the completed bottom panel, tight and trimmed.\nTECH TIP—COVERING CUTOUTS\nOn some areas (such as the aileron cutouts), it’s advantageous to cover them first with small strips of material before you cover the wing, Because the torque rods are part of the structure, it’s difficult to wrap the covering around them and achieve good results, Instead, cut a strip of covering, slide it under the torque rod and work the material into place with a trim iron, Also wrap about ¼ inch of covering onto the top and bottom of the wing. When you cover the top and bottom, it will provide a tip for the covering and make an almost invisible seam. I also cover the ends of the ailerons, elevators and rudder this way.\n8. The two-color scheme on top of the wing is easy to do with a little planning. Instead of trying to iron film over film, I cover the wing in multiple pieces so that the covering has a wooden surface—not film—under it. This reduces waste and will help you avoid the frustration caused by trying to eliminate bubbles. I usually draw the trim scheme directly on the wing, measure and then cut the covering with about ¼ inch for overlap.\nFirst, apply the main piece over the rib bays in the same way as you applied the bottom covering; the only difference is that the front and the root side of the covering have already been trimmed to size. The blue trim is in two pieces and is also pretrimmed to size.\nNext, add the inboard piece followed by the longer LE piece. Notice the sequence for applying the covering; the lightest color first followed by the inner piece and then the LE. This places the seams downwind and prevents them from lifting.\n9. For the fuselage, I added strips of balsa in the open bays where the different colors will match up. This gives the seams support and adds hardly any weight. I covered the bottom of the fuselage first, then the sides and finally the top using the heat gun to shrink the covering. The tail feathers are covered in the same way as the wing. Covering an airplane is a lot of fun, and you can amaze other fliers with your new abilities. One of the biggest benefits is that you can personalize your model to really make it stand out.","From the newsletter of the St. Paul Model Radio Controllers, Inc., Coon\nby Ellie Pflager\nI was asked to research airplane\ncovering materials and their weight ratio. I have\nlearned a great deal in doing this article. I guess\nyou could say that I have had several “ah-ha”\nmoments and now a lot of things that were discussed\nduring show-and-tells make a lot more sense to me.\nFor my research I looked at both manufacturers’ Web\nsites as well as many forum group sites and tried to\nfind multiple “agreeable opinions.” Bob LaBrash was\na great help when it came to the product weights; he\ngave me a great head start. Hope you find this\n[Tech. Editor’s Note: There is some\nmisinformation here. There are several types of\n“tissue,” but the lightest and best is known as\nJapanese tissue. The “grain” has to be determined,\nusually by tearing, it is not that noticeable. The\ngrain is then laid down span-wise on a wing, and\nthis instruction is very important. Good tissuing is\nThis is not Kleenex, but more like gift-wrap tissue.\nIt really is paper that comes in different weights.\nTissue works best on the lightest models; usually\nbalsa models designed for Free Flight (not RC). It\nhas a noticeable grain to it, and this grain should\nbe applied in the direction needing most strength.\nIt is traditionally applied to the wood frame with\ndope, although thinned glue works fine. Once the\ntissue is applied to the structure, it is shrunk\ntight with a light mist of water, then sealed with\ndope or Krylon spray enamel.\nThis covering is actually woven silk fabric that is\napplied with dope. From what I could tell this\ncovering is not used very often these days. I\ncouldn’t find any other information on this type.\nThis is like tissue but contains other fibers, and\nis generally stronger but heavier. It can be applied\nin the same manner as tissue. It is a good covering\nfor foam. The weight per square yard of this\nmaterial is 6.17 ounces.\nFabric covering can produce a very realistic finish\nand can be painted or purchased painted. Some are\nmanufactured from real woven cloth and feature a\nsimulated, hand-rubbed lacquer finish like full-size\nairplane finishes. It goes on like a film; roll out\nand apply, then iron on at low heat to properly\nactivate the adhesive. Because of the low-heat iron\nit can be used on sheeted foam. The weight per\nsquare yard of this material ranges from 2.9 to 3.3\nounces based on brand.\nThis woven material is great on solid structures,\nbut not good over open areas. It can be used to seal\nbalsa wood or foam and comes in a great variety of\nweights, the lightest (.5 ounces per square yard)\nbeing very light but flexible. This is a great\nsubstitute for silkspan when covering foam. It may\nbe applied with epoxy (wood) or water-based\npolycrylic (foam). It adds great surface strength\nfor very little weight.

These are all applied to\nthe wood frame with heat that activates an adhesive\nlayer on the underside of the film. Once the film is\nattached to the finished airplane kit frame, it is\nthen shrunk tight with heat. Film types of covering\nproduce the lightest model. The weight per square\nyard of this material ranges from 1.685 ounces to\n2.700 ounces based on brand and color. Below are\nsome brand comparisons that I did based on forum\n1.

A 20 x 36-inch sheet weighs 31.8\n5. Solite (Litefilm) by Nelson: super-light film but\nhas adhesive on the underside, some of the “opaque”\ncolors are somewhat translucent.\nPainting is another option for finishing an\nairplane. Wood or foam structures must be sealed\nbefore painting to help produce a smooth paint\nsurface. Surfaces that are sealed should not need as\nmuch paint and that will help keep the weight down.\nA primer coat is often applied after sealing. Its\nfunction is to create a surface that will bond well\n(chemically) with the paint layer.\nI found there are several types of paint, each with\ntheir own benefits. Some examples are: dope, enamel,\nacrylic, and latex. Dope is a cellulose lacquer.\nEnamel gives a great finish but is tricky to clean\nup and dries slowly.

{"question":"How do urban forests create economic opportunities for communities, and what specific environmental infrastructure cost savings do they generate for cities?","answer":"Urban forests create economic opportunities through various channels, including jobs in land restoration, forest planting, planning, and management. They particularly benefit impoverished groups by providing non-timber forest products that can be used to start small businesses. Communities can also use resources like firewood for cooking, helping address food insecurity. In terms of infrastructure cost savings, green infrastructure based on urban forests often results in lower capital costs compared to conventional gray infrastructure. Cities experience reduced expenses in site grading, paving, landscaping, and can eliminate or minimize costs for piping and detention facilities. In areas with combined sewer systems, green infrastructure controls typically cost less than conventional controls, leading to reduced public expenditures on stormwater infrastructure.","context":["Urban forests take many forms, including parks, gardens, street trees and nature reserves. Around the world, urban forests reduce poverty by conserving the environment, creating economic opportunities and providing sustainable resources to people in need.\nAs cities become more populated, urban forests help mitigate the negative effects of human activity on the environment. Trees can benefit human health by reducing water and air pollution, providing shade and improving mental health. Trees also conserve energy, absorb water runoff from storms and provide habitats for animals. Urban forests often consist of indigenous trees that can easily survive local climates and only need slight watering. As a result, urban forests are often low-maintenance, self-reinforcing tools that improve quality of life.\nImpoverished communities may particularly benefit from urban forests. A 2021 analysis by the conservation nonprofit, American Forests, found that low-income areas tend to have limited green space, which makes them more likely to become urban “heat islands.” Heat islands are the result of minimal shade and widespread heat-absorbing asphalt. The “islands” can get up to 10 degrees warmer than surrounding communities, leaving the people in them at a greater risk of experiencing heat-related illnesses like heat stroke. As global temperatures rise, urban forests reduce poverty by helping people meet their basic needs, which include cool, fresh air and clean drinking water.\nEconomic Development and Sustainable Resources\nUrban forests reduce poverty by creating jobs and helping people launch sustainable businesses. In their beginning stages, urban forests employ people for land restoration and forest planting. Urban forests also require employees for planning and management. Once urban forests fully develop, they offer a range of sustainable resources for both consumption and economic growth.\nA study by researchers at Rhodes University found that impoverished groups use and benefit from non-timber forest products more than any other group. When urban forests are located in low-income areas, people can use raw materials from forests to start small businesses and make a living. Firewood from urban forests is particularly useful because people can use it to cook. Without firewood, people may lack the ability to cook, leaving them at an increased risk of food insecurity. In order to maintain a steady supply of wood, city planners must plant urban forests on adequately large plots of land.\nThe study by Rhodes University found that some communities in South Africa live below the poverty line, in part, because they lack sufficient land for forests. With proper planning and management, urban forests can be a pathway out of poverty for communities around the world.\nCurrent Projects and Progress\nCities everywhere are beginning to acknowledge the value of urban forests. For example, Madrid in Spain is in the process of planting a 75-kilometer-long ring of forest around the entire city to reduce pollution and fight climate change. The United Nations is also working with Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, to help 30 countries across Asia and Africa grow forests. Global efforts to develop more urban forests offer hope of reducing global poverty and environmental degradation. Urban forests are practical, sustainable methods for improving lives and protecting the natural world.\n– Cleo Hudson","Green infrastructure is a cost-effective and resilient approach to our water infrastructure needs that provides many community benefits.\nWater Quality and Quantity\nWater Quality: Stormwater from urban areas delivers many pollutants to our streams, lakes, and beaches - including pathogens, nutrients, sediment, and heavy metals. In cities with combined sewer systems, high stormwater flows can also send untreated sewage into our waters. By retaining rainfall from small storms, green infrastructure reduces stormwater discharges. Lower discharge volumes translate into reduced combined sewer overflows and lower pollutant loads. Green infrastructure also treats stormwater that is not retained.\nFlooding: Conventional stormwater infrastructure quickly drains stormwater to rivers and streams, increasing peak flows and flood risk. Green infrastructure can mitigate flood risk by slowing and reducing stormwater discharges.\nWater supply: Rainwater harvesting and infiltration-based practices increase the efficiency of our water supply system. Water collected in rainwater harvesting systems can be used for outdoor irrigation and some indoor uses and can significantly reduce municipal water use. Water infiltrated into the soil can recharge groundwater, an important source of water in the United States.\nPrivate and Public Cost Savings: When stormwater management systems are based on green infrastructure rather than gray infrastructure, developers often experience lower capital costs. These savings derive from lower costs for site grading, paving, and landscaping, and smaller or eliminated piping and detention facilities. In cities with combined sewer systems, green infrastructure controls may cost less than conventional controls, and green-gray approaches can reduce public expenditures on stormwater infrastructure.\nGround Level Ozone: Ground level ozone or smog, is created when nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) interact in the presence of heat and sunlight. Smog conditions are usually worst in the summer and can lead to respiratory health problems. Vegetation can reduce ground level ozone by reducing air temperatures, reducing power plant emissions associated with air conditioning, and removing air pollutants.\nParticulate Pollution: Particulate matter refers to the tiny bits of dust, chemicals, and metals suspended in the air we breathe. Because particulate matter is so small, it can enter into the lungs and cause serious health effects. Trees, parks, and other green infrastructure features can reduce particulate pollution by absorbing and filtering particulate matter.\nHealth Effects: Breathing ground level ozone and particulate pollution can cause respiratory ailments including chest pain, coughing, aggravation of asthma, and even premature death. In their triple bottom line study on the benefits of green infrastructure, the City of Philadelphia found that increased tree canopy would reduce ozone and particulate pollution levels enough to significantly reduce mortality, hospital admissions, and work loss days.\nEnergy and Climate Change\nUrban Heat Island: Urban heat islands form as cities replace natural land cover with dense concentrations of pavement, buildings, and other surfaces that absorb and retain heat. Trees, green roofs, and other green infrastructure features can cool urban areas by shading building surfaces, deflecting radiation from the sun, and releasing moisture into the atmosphere.\nEnergy Use: By reducing local temperatures and shading building surfaces, green infrastructure lessens the cooling and heating demand for buildings, reducing energy needs and decreasing emissions from power plants.\nClimate Change: As different parts of the country become drier, wetter, or hotter, green infrastructure can help communities adapt to climate change by increasing the capacity of drainage systems to handle large storms, increasing the resilience of water supply systems in times of drought, and mitigating the urban heat island effect. Urban vegetation can also mitigate climate change by reducing the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\nWater/Energy Nexus: Treating and moving drinking water and wastewater takes a lot of energy. By reducing stormwater inflow into sewer systems, recharging aquifers, and conserving water, green infrastructure can significantly reduce energy use.\nHabitat and Wildlife\nHabitat Improvement: Vegetation in the urban environment provides habitat for birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and insects. Even small patches of vegetation such as green roofs can provide habitat for a variety of insects and birds. By reducing erosion and sedimentation, green infrastructure also improves habitat in small streams and washes.\nHabitat Connectivity: Large scale green infrastructure, such as parks and urban forests, also help to facilitate wildlife movement and connect wildlife populations between habitats. Learn how Loxahatchee, Florida is protecting the local watershed and conserving native ecosystems through the Loxahatchee Regional Greenways System.\nGreen jobs: Green infrastructure can reduce a community’s infrastructure costs, promote economic growth, and create construction and maintenance jobs. As demand for green infrastructure skills increases, a range of new training and certification programs has emerged.\nHealth Benefits: More green space and parks encourages outdoor physical activity, reducing obesity and preventing associated chronic diseases such as heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, Type II diabetes, arthritis, and certain kinds of cancer.\nRecreation space: Green infrastructure’s vegetation and trees can increase publicly available recreation areas, allowing urban communities to enjoy greenery without leaving the city. Additionally, green infrastructure’s vegetation and permeable pavements can reduce noise pollution by damping traffic, train, or plane noise.\nProperty values: By utilizing green infrastructure in construction and increasing vegetation and tree cover, green infrastructure can increase property values"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:04edc5f6-3c0f-42d1-926e-e7e785e75d32>","<urn:uuid:9cb7dab0-7fea-445e-bbe3-af81dae72270>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the wildlife filming approaches of Jack Hubley and David Attenborough differ in terms of their use of technology?","answer":"Jack Hubley and David Attenborough had different approaches to wildlife filming technology. Hubley maintained a more traditional approach, focusing on self-shooting stills and videos, processing his own film, and editing content himself. In contrast, Attenborough consistently employed cutting-edge technologies including thermal imaging, infrared footage, time-lapse photography, and underwater filming techniques to capture unprecedented animal behaviors. Attenborough's technological innovations allowed him to reveal previously unseen natural phenomena like leopard hunts in infrared and emperor penguins' huddle strategy through time-lapse.","context":["- Michael Miville MMVisuals\nLa Bella Vita: Birdman\nAs I pulled into the driveway of this quaint little house in the woods to interview and take a portrait photo of Jack Hubley, I was greeted by a black and white hunting dog who ran up and cut off my car, and then as I got out walked over and sniffed and licked my hand. Immediately I felt comforted by the friendliness a well trained dog brings to a situation and a bit more a part of nature than I had felt in quite some time. That, I will say, was just the beginning of a very sincere interview with a very humble man, Jack Hubley\nJack has just retired in April from his career in television as the host of multiple television shows, one of which was nationally syndicated. He had spent the past 30 years teaching people facts about the gentle and sometimes comical side of nature and animals. Along side him during his career was his lovely wife Tina and eventually his 2 daughters. Jack said that he knew she was the one when he showed up with a 6 foot boa constrictor and she didn't react with an \"Ewwww!\" or by screaming, this meant she had potential. He also said that she \"learned to live with the animals\". Now, almost 40 years later, she's still tolerating his obsession with them.\nGrowing up in Lititz, PA, Jack, as an \"amateur naturalist,\" spent time collecting small animals. \"Whatever was smaller and less powerful to me was probably dragged home and stuck in a cage,\" he describes matter of fact. Growing up in this small town, he had a \"long narrow bedroom lined with terrariums, aquariums and cages.\" A collection of \"flying squirrels, alligators, outback was a red fox, a grey fox at different times\" all of which lead to him gaining a respect for all creatures. As he continued to collect and learn he also became interested in hunting. With his dad and grandfather being hunters and fishermen, he says \"I was a fisherman before a hunter\".\nAt age five he recalls, one morning his dad standing over him at the head of his bed waking him up by saying \"Wake up Skipper, we're going fishing.\" Soon that memory turned to habit. \"The older I get the more of a religion it becomes. I like to eat things that I have been responsible for killing and taking from the forest. It's very near religion.\" Learning that to respect creatures meant respecting them the most if you were taking their life. You really need to understand that you are taking this animals life to replenish your life. To this day Jack continues to hunt, fish and respect the animals he kills by using them as food which his family does enjoy! He says his daughters, specifically, love a rare venison steak!\nEducation was always a part of his life–although his path was not traditional, Jack took a slight turn heading to college. His mother, Dorothy Hubley was a piano teacher and and passed on her musical talents to Jack. He said she was the person that instilled within him a work ethic. Due to this he decided to go to Lebanon Valley College for a music degree on a trumpet scholarship. After college he thought he would make his way onto The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson as part of the band but eventually realized he didn't like the night life scene and it didn't \"work with his lifestyle.\"\nEventually he turned to writing. Finding that writing articles for newspapers and magazines was really where he excelled and gave him a passion. Realizing that to remain relevant he needed to have a few more skills, he dabbled in photography, picking up multiple cameras, lenses and learning to develop his own film so he could write the story and photograph what he needed for his articles. While working for a publication called Lancaster Farming Newspaper, in 1982 he started a column in the Lancaster Sunday News as the Outdoors Writer. In 1987 he got a call to audition for a nature show Call of the Outdoors on WGAL since the current host, Tom Fegely, who was retiring. After what he described as an \"exhaustive\" lengthy interview process, he became the next host. He also learned to edit the film himself. He was shooting the stills and videos for all of these by himself while on camera and then processed all of the photos and videos while writing all of the articles and scripts. \"I pretty much invented my career\" Jack recalled.\nWhile host for this show, some federal regulations changed and so did the show. One day he was doing nature and animal segments, the next he was teaching kids about animals. While this transition was unexpected, teaching kids continues to satisfy him daily. Along with his favorite animal and co-host, an English Setter named Trusty and a bleacher full of children, he spent 3 years educating youth on the show Call for Kids. He said of Trusty \"every man deserves one great dog, and that was him.\"\nIn 1995 he began producing and hosting A Wild Moment. These were 1-minute nature vignettes that WGAL aired during the newscast. After Hearst-Argyle purchased WGAL, the company approached Jack about expanding them to a half an hour, renaming them 'Wild Moments' and syndicating them.\" This would mean airing it across the country in about 140 markets as a half hour show starting in 2000. This opportunity allowed him to travel throughout the world for this show. When the show was cancelled he decided to pursue speaking engagements and was eventually asked by Hershey Entertainment & Resorts to start a Falconry program, which he did in 2008. Meanwhile he continued to produce his 1-minute \"A Wild Moment,\" nature vignettes which aired weekly until April of this year, when Jack finally decided that 30 years was a good benchmark for ending his on-air career. He jokes that he's only 33% retired, since he will continue his \"Wild Neighbors\" wildlife leactures, as well as hosting \"The Falconry Experience,\" for Hershey Entertainment & Resorts. You can also find out what Jack is up to on his website jackhubley.com\nAt this point, you might be asking yourself, who is the magnificent creature in these photos, to that I say I've already talked about Jack enough... ;) Kidding!! The bird is his 15 year old Golden Eagle named Alpha. She is a magnificent animal who may love Jack more than killing small game. She was very protective of him and kept giving me the....\nWait for it....\nEagle EYE!! (I couldn't resist!)\nShe was actually very good, although it took a few minutes for her to get used to me. Jack says \"She does not do public relations,\" Jack jokes. You won't see her at the Hershey Falconry Experience because she is a hunter. Jack keeps other birds of prey at Hershey for that experience, including his other eagle, Bliss, \"She is on a Federal Eagle Education Permit and not allowed to hunt, which I explained to her.\" Alpha is on a federal hunting permit. Lots of regulations from the federal government surround owning and using these birds for various different types of work or hunting.\nJack says that \"hunting is a craft that requires a lifetime of learning\" and \"Falconry is a very archaic craft that involves very primitive animals.\" While looking into the sky he gives a tip that to start identifying birds of prey \"Turkey Vultures fly in a slight \"V\" with a wobble, like he's learning. A Hawk is flap flap glide with a steady glide. An Eagle has a very steady soaring pattern with a straight across flat wing span and steady glide.\"\nIt was an absolute pleasure to interview this kind animal lover. Jack's passion and respect for nature and wildlife is evident and it stirs a sense of excitement and wonder within you when he shares his knowledge and stories. I know I am not the first who has caught Jack's enthusiasm for nature. And just like that–the man who taught millions to appreciate nature's wild creatures has indeed become a rare, but greatly loved, breed all his own.\n#Portrait #lancasterpaportraitphotographer #LancasterPa #portraitphotographer #philadelphiaportraitphotographer #bird #goldeneagle #birdsofprey #portraitphotographerLancasterpa #CelebrityPortraitPhotographer #CelebrityPortrait","Attenborough films that changed the way we see the natural world - our top clips\nIn the six decades since his first wildlife film was broadcast, Sir David Attenborough’s programmes have consistently launched new formats, concepts and technology.

{"question":"I work in environmental finance - what are the key aspects of sector-based offset credits for tropical forests, and what challenges do these markets currently face?","answer":"Sector-based offset credits for tropical forests (REDD) are designed to reduce emissions from tropical deforestation, which accounts for 11-14% of global GHG emissions. These credits could be used by California covered entities for a portion of their Cap-and-Trade obligations, potentially yielding benefits to biodiversity and forest-dependent communities. However, these markets face significant challenges, including market fragmentation, lack of transparency, and insufficient price transparency. According to the World Bank, carbon credit prices have fallen to under $5 per ton for most categories due to difficulty distinguishing high-quality projects from lower-quality ones. Some companies have even stopped participating due to concerns about greenwashing accusations.","context":["Sector-Based Offset Credits\n- Compliance Offset Program\n- Cap-and-Trade Program\n- ARB Offset Credit Issuance\n- Compliance Offset Protocols\n- Offset Project Operators\n- Offset Project Registries\n- Offset Protocol Task Force\n- Requirements for Tribes\n- Direct Environmental Benefits in the State (DEBS)\n- Early Action Offset Credits\n- Sector-Based Offset Credits\nIn addition to the domestic Compliance Offset Protocols, the Cap-and-Trade Regulation also includes the potential for international offset credits generated through approved sector-based crediting programs issued by a subnational jurisdiction in a developing country. If approved, sector-based offset credits would be eligible for use by California covered entities to comply with a small portion of their Cap-and-Trade obligations. This portion is limited to half of the quantitative usage limit. CARB has not approved any sector-based crediting programs to date. This page describes California's ongoing evaluation of sector-based crediting programs, and in particular, those related to tropical forests.\nRecognizing that addressing climate change requires a comprehensive look at the causes of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, AB 32 directed CARB to consult with the federal government and other nations to identify the most effective strategies and methods to reduce GHGs, manage GHG control programs, and to facilitate the development of integrated and cost-effective regional, national, and international GHG reduction programs. CARB began assessing emerging international mitigation actions as it developed the AB 32 Scoping Plan and the California Cap-and-Trade Program. One of the most studied sectors within which mitigation actions have been proposed has been tropical forests.\nEmissions from tropical deforestation and forest degradation are estimated to account for between 11% and 14% of global GHG emissions. Initiatives for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, or REDD, are thus a critical part of addressing global climate change, including climate change in California. Mitigating tropical forest deforestation may have additional effects on California's climate and environment because research indicates a direct link between tropical deforestation and reduced California precipitation. In addition, the inclusion of REDD sector-based offset credits within the already existing quantitative usage limit for offset credits within California's Cap-and-Trade Program would contribute to cost-containment benefits under the program, demonstrate California's climate leadership, and yield benefits to biodiversity, forest-dependent community livelihoods, and other areas integral to low emissions rural development in tropical jurisdictions.\nThe Cap-and-Trade Regulation already includes general requirements for sector-based crediting programs, such as REDD. (See sections 95991-95995.) CARB released a whitepaper setting forth the history, status, and next steps of its evaluation of sector-based crediting, and REDD programs in particular. This whitepaper formed the basis of a workshop scheduled for October 28, 2015.\n- April 28, 2016 Workshop\n- March 18, 2016 Technical Paper\n- Whitepaper on Sector-Based Offset Credits\n- Appendix A - ROW Final Recommendations\n- Appendix B - Acre Biomass Map(IPAM)\n- Appendix C - Chiapas Biomass Map(IPAM)\nInformation on all sector-based related workshops is available here: Cap-and-Trade Program Workshops.\nAs part of its ongoing evaluation, California has been involved in several collaborative initiatives to better understand and assess REDD.\nGovernors' Climate and Forests Task Force\nSince 2008, California has been part of a collaborative group of states and provinces called the Governors' Climate and Forests Task Force (GCF). As it stands currently, the GCF is comprised of 29 different subnational jurisdictions, including states and provinces from Brazil, Indonesia, Ivory Coast, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Spain, and the U.S. These jurisdictions are included in the GCF because collectively, they are home to over 25 percent of the world's tropical forests, and reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in any one of these jurisdictions will result in significant climate benefits. The GCF seeks to advance jurisdictional programs designed to promote low emissions rural development and reduced emissions from deforestation and land use and link these activities with emerging GHG compliance regimes and other pay-for-performance opportunities. The GCF has also issued the Rio Branco Declaration, in which signatories commit to reducing tropical deforestation by 80% by 2020. California is a signatory to this Declaration.\nMore information about the GCF is available here: http://www.gcftaskforce.org/\nREDD Offset Working Group\nCalifornia was also involved in a smaller collaborative group called the REDD Offset Working Group. This group arose out of a 2010 Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Environmental Cooperation between the State of Acre of the Federative Republic of Brazil, the State of Chiapas of the United Mexican States, and the State of California. Like California, Acre and Chiapas are members of the GCF, and they have been implementing innovative strategies to address climate change. The focus of the REDD Offset Working Group was to develop cooperation and “state to state sectoral REDD linkage recommendations,” taking into account “the legal, technical and economic considerations in developing [REDD] sector-based credits.” The REDD Offset Working Group, in which California, Chiapas, and Acre participated as observers, was made up of technical experts on topics ranging from aerial mapping to on-the-ground forest management and from local community engagement to market design. These experts worked for nearly two years on developing a set of recommendations to present to CARB and its counterparts in Chiapas and Acre regarding how the states could integrate REDD into their climate programs. The final recommendations were submitted to CARB on July 18, 2013.\nREDD Offset Working Group Documentation\nFurther inquiries regarding this matter should be directed to Jason Gray, Branch Chief, Climate Change Program Evaluation Branch, at (916) 324-3507.","Opening Statement of Commissioner Christy Goldsmith Romero: The CFTC’s Role with Voluntary Carbon Credit Markets\nSecond Convening on Voluntary Carbon Markets\nJuly 19, 2023\nRemarks as prepared for delivery\nGood morning and thank you all for joining us at the CFTC’s second convening on voluntary carbon markets. I want to thank Chairman Benham for his continued priority of climate issues and for working with me to promote resilience to climate risk.\nUnderstanding and monitoring climate risk is a critical role for the CFTC, as the physical impacts of climate change pose serious risks to commodities markets and climate change poses systemic risk to the financial system, as the physical. I have met with farmers and producers, reviewed United States Department of Agriculture and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reports, as well as seen and heard many examples of the impacts that severe climate events have on those markets. Last year, farmers and ranchers experienced $21 billion in total crop & rangeland losses, mostly s drought and wildfire. 2023 is shaping up to be a year of heavy climate impacts with two-thirds of the U.S. corn production area experiencing drought and harvested winter wheat substantially down as the season progresses. This naturally serves as a risk for derivatives markets.\nOnce we know the risk, we can plan for it. We can manage around it. We can use every tool at our disposal as an opportunity to manage risk and promote climate resilience. In the end, managing risk is what derivatives markets are all about.\nI have heard a lot from farmers and producers about their contributions to climate resilience. In many ways, they are the originals of sustainability. Longstanding practices like conservation tillage or no-till, planting cover crops, and prescribed grazing can all help improve a farm or ranch’s resilience to climate-related disasters, and remove carbon from the atmosphere. This is especially important because 40% of natural disaster damage is uninsured in the United States. The US Department of Agriculture announced plans to invest almost $3 billion in 70 projects under its Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities funding program, which could result in more than 60 million metric tons of carbon dioxide sequestered.\nSome market participants see potential in voluntary carbon credit markets as another opportunity to manage climate-related risk. There are currently carbon credit futures products trading on CFTC-regulated exchanges. This puts the CFTC in a unique position.\nThere is much interest in spot voluntary carbon credit markets over which the CFTC has antifraud jurisdiction. Despite predictions that carbon credits may grow from a $2 billion to a $50 billion market, research by Bloomberg found that corporations used 4% fewer credits in 2022.\nThe spot voluntary carbon credit markets continue to face challenges. I look forward to hearing today about some of the challenges to these markets. I also look forward to hearing about possible solutions.\nWell-designed markets help deliver liquidity and price transparency, while managing risk, when participants are confident they have credible information about the product. One of the biggest challenges in spot voluntary carbon markets is fragmentation that prevents market confidence. There are different registries and standard setters, and much of the market happens in opaque over the counter transactions. A lack of transparency through consistent, comparable data with an agreed-upon taxonomy can present challenges to proper functioning of markets, including price discovery.\nThe recent slowdown in markets may reflect concerns over a lack of transparency and trust. Those interested in participating in the markets want to be assured that they are purchasing high quality credits. Some companies have pivoted away from carbon markets entirely out of concerns that using carbon credits leaves them open to accusations of greenwashing.\nThe market should signal through pricing those carbon credits that are high quality, compared with credits reflecting projects that do not achieve the requisite level of carbon reduction or are temporary. However, there is insufficient price transparency given the fragmentation and lack of trust in the market. According to a May 2023 report by the World Bank, the price of carbon credits has fallen to under $5 per ton for most categories, except credits for carbon removal which trade at approximately $15 per ton. It attributes this drop, in part, to a “least common denominator” effect, where high-quality projects cannot be distinguished from lower-quality efforts of the same type.\nEfforts by voluntary bodies like the Integrity Council on Voluntary Carbon Markets (“ICVCM”) are an important and welcome attempt to create a common understanding of a high-quality carbon credit. The ICVCM has released Core Carbon Principles but has not yet finalized an assessment framework for identifying credits “that create real, additional and verifiable climate impact with high environmental and social integrity.” I have had the fortune of spending time discussing this work with Annette Nazareth of the ICVCM, who was an SEC Commissioner when I worked at the SEC and who is a participant today.\nBuyers of carbon credits are also becoming clearer about how they will use credits in order to avoid accusations of greenwashing. The Voluntary Carbon Markets Initiative (“VCMI”), announced at the COP26 global climate convening, has developed a Claims Code of Practice to guide companies on how “they can credibly make voluntary use of carbon credits as part of their near-term emissions reduction objectives, and long-term net zero commitments.” One key element of that code is encouraging companies to stop treating carbon credits as “offsetting” their emissions and instead to frame them as a contribution above and beyond what they are doing to decarbonize their own business.\nThe Role of the CFTC\nFirst and foremost, our role is to regulate U.S. derivatives markets. The Commission should work with exchanges and market participants to ensure the integrity of derivatives markets and promote responsible innovation in environmental products. A few weeks ago, I met with both CME and ICE to discuss their voluntary carbon credit derivative products, the markets, market demand, and the issues that surround these markets. These conversations build on my proposal earlier this year that the CFTC work with exchanges on listing standards through guidance related to environmental products. These standards would be designed to guide exchanges in fulfilling the Commodity Exchange Act core principles. The guidance could involve looking at the standards developed by the ICVCM and the VCMI and other due diligence.\nAdditionally, in March at ISDA’s ESG conference, I proposed that the Commission follow a similar oversight and approach to environmental products as those adopted for digital assets. This would include education including related to the qualities of a high-quality carbon credit, asserting our anti-fraud legal authority, including in spot carbon credit markets, increasing intelligence in the market, robust enforcement, and government-wide and international coordination. And to continue mirroring the approach the Commission has taken to digital assets, I proposed that the Commission adopt a heightened review framework of any self-certified environmental products that are listed on exchanges, including those related to carbon credits, just as it did with derivatives on digital assets.\nI continue to believe that bringing more of this market onto exchanges would increase transparency and bring greater confidence to the market, including related to pricing. Additionally, listing standards in the derivatives markets could prove an example for how the spot market might consider changing.\nSecond, we have antifraud authority over spot markets. In June, the Commission took an important step forward in promoting the integrity of spot voluntary carbon markets by announcing an Environmental Fraud Task Force. I had advocated for this task force and I appreciate Chairman Behnam’s leadership and working with me to launch the task force. I appreciate the Director of Enforcement who has worked closely with me and my office to launch the task force, and develop strategies to ensure the task force’s success. We are working on sourcing cases, and an important source are whistleblower tips, as we have recently announced. I am extremely pleased with this launch and intend to keep our sleeves rolled up to combat fraud in these markets.\nThank you to all of our participants today. I look forward to hearing your views, as well as other concrete opportunities for the Commission to ensure that carbon credit derivatives markets work well and related to our antifraud authority over the spot markets.\n Daniel Munch, “New Estimates Reveal Major 2022 Weather Disasters Caused Over $21 Billion in Crop Losses,” Farm Bureau (Mar. 3, 2023), https://www.fb.org/market-intel/new-estimates-reveal-major-2022-weather-disasters-caused-over-21-billion-in-crop-losses.\n Office of the Chief Economist, “Corn Areas in Drought,” United States Department of Agriculture (updated July 4, 2023), https://agindrought.unl.edu/Maps.aspx?1; United States Department of Agriculture “Crop Progress and Condition: Winter Wheat in United States, 2023” https://www.nass.usda.gov/Charts_and_Maps/Crop_Progress_&_Condition/2023/index.php.\n Natural Resources Conservation Service, “Conservation Practices on Cultivated Cropland,” United States Department of Agriculture (January 2022), https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/Internet/FSE_DOCUMENTS/nrcseprd1893222.pdf\n Swiss Re Institute, “Natural catastrophes and inflation in 2022: a perfect storm” at 30 (2023), https://www.swissre.com/institute/research/sigma-research/sigma-2023-01.html.\n United States Department of Agriculture, “Partnerships for Climate-Smart Commodities” (last accessed July 14, 2023), https://www.usda.gov/climate-solutions/climate-smart-commodities.\n Ben Elgin, Alastair Marsh, and Max de Haldevang, Faulty Credits Tarnish Billion-Dollar Carbon Offset Seller, Bloomberg (Mar. 24, 2023), https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2023-03-24/carbon-offset-seller-s-forest-protection-projects-questioned.\n Shane Shifflett, ”Companies Are Buying Large Numbers of Carbon Offsets That Don’t Cut Emissions,” The Wall Street Journal (Sept. 8, 2022), https://www.wsj.com/articles/renewables-carbon-credits-do-not-cut-emissions-united-nations-verra-gold-standard-11662644900?st=9wb1m73angup5xv&reflink=desktopwebshare_permalink.\n World Bank Group, States and Trends of Carbon Pricing 2023 at 41 (May 2023), https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/entities/publication/58f2a409-9bb7-4ee6-899d-be47835c838f.

{"question":"Given that I often need medication, what are the key differences between Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage plans in terms of prescription drug coverage?","answer":"Medicare Part D and Medicare Advantage plans handle prescription drug coverage differently. With Part D, you get standalone prescription drug coverage, but you'll need to pay an additional premium. In contrast, most Medicare Advantage plans include prescription drug coverage (called MAPD plans) without requiring an extra premium. Both types of plans use formularies that list covered medications, but Medicare Advantage plans often provide additional benefits not included in Part D, such as dental, vision, and hearing coverage. While Part D focuses solely on prescription drugs, Medicare Advantage plans combine drug coverage with other healthcare benefits while typically offering lower out-of-pocket costs.","context":["What Drugs Are Covered By Part D Plans?\nMedications are prescribed for all types of medical conditions these days. Many Medicare recipients depend on prescription medications to reduce or eliminate the symptoms of various conditions. Unfortunately, prescription medications can be costly without insurance. Medicare recipients can save money on prescription drugs by enrolling in Part D. Prescription drug coverage does have limitations, however, so it’s important to understand what is and is not included in Medicare Part D.\nMedicare Benefits Solutions\nSep 8, 2020\nMedications covered by Part D plans\nMedicare Part D covers a wide variety of prescription drugs, but there are some limitations and exceptions. In order to know whether a drug is covered by your plan, you will need to check your plan’s formulary. A formulary lists all drugs that are included in a particular plan’s coverage. Even though there are standards set by the federal Medicare program, your plan may include or exclude specific medications. You’ll want to discuss your options with your physician, if possible before having a prescription written. An alternative medication may be available that addresses your condition and works within your plan’s formulary.\nWhat drugs are not covered?\nIf you find that no suitable alternative exists and the drug you are prescribed is not included in your plan’s formulary, you can file for an exemption with Medicare. This is usually done through your physician’s office, but you can also contact your plan manager or local Medicare office to learn more. You will need to provide a valid reason for needing an exemption, and if approved, you may still have limitations on coverage of your exempted medications.\nDoes Medicare Part D cover medications administered in a doctor’s office?Although most prescription medications are purchased from a pharmacy and self-administered at home, there are scenarios in which you may be given a medication outside of the home. A doctor may administer medication in his or her office to monitor its effectiveness or a medication could be used during an inpatient hospital stay. In these cases, Medicare Part D would usually not cover the cost of the medications. Instead, Medicare Parts A and/or B would apply. Medicare Part A provides coverage for care while in a hospital or skilled nursing facility, and Medicare Part B covers the cost of outpatient care administered in a doctor’s office or at a clinic.\nAre supplements covered?\nPart D prescription drug coverage does not usually include supplements and over-the-counter medications. This means that you will be required to cover the full cost of these items, and you will also be ineligible to file a claim for purchases.\nIf, however, you have a Medicare Advantage plan, you may be entitled to additional benefits that are not included in Original Medicare. These benefits may help you pay for supplements or provide reimbursement for purchases of some over-the-counter medications. To be sure that any medication you take is covered, you will need to refer to your plan’s formulary or speak with your Medicare plan manager\nComparing drug plans\nPrescription drug coverage was not originally included in the Medicare program when it was introduced in 1965, but as of 2006, coverage for self-administered drugs is available to Medicare recipients under Part D coverage. This optional coverage provides a benefit for individuals who frequently need medications or who have chronic conditions that require routine treatment through the use of prescription drugs. Review and compare the drug plans available in your area to find the one that meets your individual needs.\nFind a new Medicare plan\nGet a plan recommendation based on what's important to you.","Medicare Advantage plans (Medicare Part C) provide you the same benefits as Original Medicare Parts A and B, but with additional benefits. Private insurance companies that contract with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) offer these plans. As of December 2022, 48% of Arizonans were enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan. Nearly half of all enrollees choose a Medicare Advantage plan because of its cost savings and extra benefits.\nYou must be eligible to enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan. To be eligible, you must be enrolled in Original Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) and Original Medicare Part B (medical insurance) and live in the Medicare Advantage plan’s service area. There are 157 Medicare Advantage plans available in Arizona; however, you’ll only have access to a portion of those because availability is based on the county that you live in.\nBetween 2022 and 2023, there was a slight change in plan options (155 in 2022). However, between 2021 and 2022, there was a 29.2% change in plan options (120 plans in 2021). With such an increase between 2021 and 2023, you have an even greater opportunity to find a suitable plan for your health and budget.\nMost Medicare Advantage plans offer enrollees comprehensive and routine dental, hearing, and vision. Some plans provide wellness and healthcare planning, reduced cost-sharing, and rewards and incentives programs.\nNone of these benefits are offered by Original Medicare.\nThe five Arizona counties with the highest Medicare Advantage enrollment are Santa Cruz County (60%), Pima County (55%), Graham County (52%), Maricopa County (49%), and Pinal County (48%).\nMedicare Advantage plans are required to provide the same coverage as Original Medicare Part A and Original Medicare Part B. The difference is that many of these plans offer an out-of-pocket maximum that Original Medicare doesn’t provide. This protects you from potential high and unexpected costs with Original Medicare alone.\n“Because Original Medicare doesn’t have a maximum out-of-pocket, enrolling in a Medicare Advantage plan can safeguard you against unknown out-of-pocket costs.“\nMost Medicare Advantage plans also offer extra benefits that Original Medicare doesn’t: comprehensive dental, vision, and hearing coverage. Plus, you can usually find a Medicare Advantage plan that covers your prescription drug coverage (Part D). These plans are called Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug Plans (MAPD).\nThere are three primary reasons you may choose to enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan; 1) low or no-cost monthly premiums, 2) lower out-of-pocket costs, and 3) additional benefits such as comprehensive dental, vision, hearing, and more.\nAll individuals enrolled in Arizona Medicare have access to a $0 monthly premium Medicare Advantage plan. For those that pay a premium, the average monthly premium is $12.00. When you enroll in a Medicare Advantage plan in Arizona, you pay your Original Medicare premiums plus the Medicare Advantage monthly premium.\nThe bonus with Medicare Advantage is that most plans include prescription drug coverage, which cuts out an extra premium for Part D coverage. Also, Medicare Advantage plans have an out-of-pocket maximum, unlike Original Medicare.\nWhen enrolled in Original Medicare alone, you don’t have a maximum for what you could spend on copayment or coinsurance. This is risky. One way to reduce your risk is with a Medicare Advantage plan.\nMedicare Advantage plans set their deductibles, coinsurance, and copays within limits set by the federal government. These limits help you manage out-of-pocket costs and reduce exposure to unknown and unexpected medical bills.\nOnce your Medicare Advantage plan’s out-of-pocket maximum is reached, including the deductible, your plan pays 100% of covered medical expenses for the remainder of the plan year.\nOriginal Medicare doesn’t offer comprehensive dental, vision, or hearing coverage. You’ll need to pay out-of-pocket for most services, including routine care. These are benefits that most Medicare Advantage plans offer. Most plans include reduced cost-sharing, over-the-counter and wellness products, transportation assistance, telemedicine, fitness programs, and other reward and incentive programs.\nWhen choosing among your Medicare Advantage plan options, you should consider the extra benefits you would like to have and then work with a local licensed agent to help you locate the plan that suits your needs.\nIn 2023, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Value-Based Insurance Design (VBDI) program offers Arizona enrollees unique programs.\nThrough the VBDI program, 33 Medicare Advantage plans provide enrollees:\nThere isn’t only one type of Medicare Advantage plan in Arizona. In fact, you’ll have four types to choose among.\nHealth Maintenance Organizations (HMOs) and Preferred Provider Organizations (PPOs) are the most popular types. There are also Special Needs Plans (SNPs) and Private Fee-for-Service (PFFS) plans. If you live somewhere rural, a PFFS may be available to you.\nThese four plan types have four things in common.\nThe differences between the plans are network flexibility and price. Keep reading to learn which plan is best for your health and budget.\nIf you’re choosing between Medicare Advantage plans, most likely, it’s between a Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) and a Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) plan.\nHMO plans are typically the most popular Medicare Advantage plan type. HMOs require that you receive most of your services in a network, except for emergency care.\nCare through a Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) Medicare Advantage plan is slightly different. PPO plans have a network of preferred providers, but you can choose doctors or hospitals outside the network at a higher cost. PPO plans typically have regional or local PPO providers and provide greater flexibility.\nBoth HMO and PPO plans have four things in common.\nWondering whether an HMO or PPO Medicare Advantage plan is best for you? A local listened agent can help you find the plan that includes the doctors you value and the prescriptions you need. Call (623) 223-8884 to find a plan that maintains your doctors.\nMedicare Advantage Special Needs Plans (SNPs) are limited to people with specific illnesses or characteristics. For example, if you have diabetes, End-Stage Renal Disease, HIV/AIDS, chronic heart failure, or dementia, you may qualify for a SNP plan. These plans are tailored to meet the needs of these illnesses, including provider choices and drug coverage.\nIf you have a chronic illness, you should speak with a local licensed agent who can help you find the right plan for your health and budget. Call (623) 223-8884 for a plan tailored to your health needs.\nMedicare Advantage Private Fee-for-Service (PFFS) plans determine how much it will pay doctors, health care providers, and hospitals and how much you pay when you access care. With a PFFS, you pay any cost-sharing expenses at the time of service. Aftercare, the provider bills your plan for the remaining amount.\n|Alignment Health Plan||Imperial Insurance Companies|\n|Banner Health Plan||Magellan Health|\n|Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona||SCAN Desert Health Plan|\nMost Medicare beneficiaries are weighing four things when choosing their plan. Here are the questions you want to ask to find the right plan for your health and budget.\nA local licensed agent can help you discover which plan has the right mix. It’s a lot to consider, and you don’t have to do it alone. Call (623) 223-8884 to get help finding the right plan for your health and budget.\nAll Medicare beneficiaries in Arizona have access to a $0 premium Medicare Advantage plan. For those with a plan premium, the average this year is $12.00. Keep in mind that this amount changes every year.\nYour Original Medicare Part B premium is paid directly to Medicare through your Social Security benefit or paid monthly or quarterly. Your Medicare Advantage or MAPD plan premium is paid directly to the plan provider and is in addition to your Original Medicare premiums.\nWhile the plan premiums are stable, you should also consider out-of-pocket expenses such as deductibles, copay, and/or coinsurance. These costs depend on your chosen plan and should be factored into your budget.\nWondering if you qualify for a $0 premium Medicare Advantage plan? Call (623) 223-8884 to speak with a local licensed agent.\nKnowing when to enroll can save money and ensure you don’t incur late enrollment penalties. Get ready to mark your calendars with these essential enrollment periods.\nMost Arizonans will enroll in Medicare during their seven-month Initial Enrollment Period. This is a crucial enrollment period for you. You should enroll in Original Medicare Part A and B during this time. The enrollment period begins three months before you turn 65, the month you turn 65, and ends three months after you turn 65.\nYou may – or may not – need to sign up for Medicare. For those collecting Social Security benefits, you’ll likely be automatically enrolled.\nYou’ll want to mark this seven-month window on your calendar if you’re not. You could incur a lifetime late enrollment penalty if you don’t enroll in Medicare Part A and B during your Initial Enrollment Period. The penalty is added to your standard Part B premium, increases the longer you wait, and can never be removed.\nShould you miss your Initial Enrollment Period, you may be able to enroll during the General Enrollment Period or a Special Enrollment Period if you qualify.\nWant to be sure you don’t miss your Initial Enrollment Period? We’ve created a handy quiz for you to take. Take our Medicare eligibility quiz today to receive enrollment reminders.\nShould you miss your Initial Enrollment Period, you must mark Medicare’s General Enrollment Period in your calendar. From January 1 – March 31, annually, you can enroll in Medicare Part A and/or Part B or make a plan change that is effective July 1st. Note that if you’re enrolling in Medicare for the first time during the General Enrollment Period, that likely means that you’ll incur late enrollment penalties.\nKnowing when to make a plan change can help you save money. There are three other enrollment periods that you should mark on your calendar.\nA local licensed agent can help you review your plan options and enrollment periods in Arizona.

{"question":"What is bulletproof glass and how is Arquus enhancing protection in their vehicles?","answer":"Bulletproof glass is a strong, optically transparent material made from multiple layers of glass (hard and soft) combined with polycarbonate, achieving thicknesses from 19 to 89mm. Meanwhile, Arquus is enhancing vehicle protection through multiple approaches: developing their own Level 3 and Level 4 ballistic solutions, creating composite floor solutions for blast protection, and implementing energy-absorbing seats to protect crew from accelerations. They also use advanced welding processes like Friction Stir Welding (FSW) to improve blast resistance.","context":["By Paolo Valpolini\nWhile in the past Renault Trucks Defense used to integrate on its armoured vehicles third party protection kits, the experience acquired led the company, now named Arquus, to develop its own ballistic and mine protection solutions. The company is currently working on many subjects such as vehicles’ antiblast structure, decoupling of the crew from the underbelly blast thanks to seats, footrest and equipment supports, and obviously add-on ballistic kits to cover as many threats as possible.\nConsidering the latter, Arquus is in the final stage of development of Level 3 and Level 4 solutions, which just went through qualification tests at the Banc National d’Épreuve de Saint-Étienne. Although not many technical details were provided, Arquus experts told EDR On-Line that “these solutions are robust, their performances are only marginally reduced over time, and they are competitive in terms of weight and cost compared to what is available on the market.” Arquus developed its own database allowing optimising performances, mass and protection, while respecting STANAG 4569. The latest tool used by Arquus scientists to develop their armour solutions is the ballistic simulation that has recently joined the other ones, increasing the capacity of optimising ballistic packages.\nShifting to blast threats, Arquus developed a considerable portfolio of solutions aimed at protecting the crew and transported personnel from mine and IED threats. Metal double-floors developed in-house are already used on the Fortress and VAB Mk 3, but composite solutions are being developed that might replace metal ones both for the floor as well as for the wheel arch. Some composite packages are already in use on the aforementioned vehicles and are also part of VBL’s upgrade kits. A sandwich of metal and composite elements has been developed, Arquus pushing forward on that path having launched a new research project exploiting the ASTRID (Accompagnement Spécifique des Travaux de Recherches et d’Innovation Défense) support scheme, together with the DGA, academia and the Franco-German Saint-Louis Research Institute. Arquus considers that in the future a whole composite floor might be produced, allowing dealing both with blast and structural issues; a model of such a solution was visible but could not be pictured.\nMass reduction is also linked to the structural assembly process. Arquus is working on improvements in welding processes, exploiting digital simulation systems, and is considering also new processes such as the FSW (Friction Stir Welding); this solid-state joining process uses a non-consumable tool to join two facing work pieces without melting the material, improving welding mechanical characteristics both in the static domain as well as in the rapid dynamics domain, the latter being a key element for blast resistance. Two targets were visible, one welded using classic processes, the second using FSW; submitted to an identical blast, the first was totally destroyed as the welding was ruptured, while the second featured only a deformation, the welding having withstood the blast.\nThe company is also working on 3D printing; an example was visible, made of an armour plate on which some elements were added using 3-D printing. Arquus experts were adamant in telling us that add-on elements are far from having the same ballistic properties of the plate, however the company managed to reach very good adhesive properties between the base plate and the add-on element, this allowing to consider such technology for a number of applications.\nOnce the blast does not penetrate the vehicle, then personnel on board must be de-coupled from accelerations in order to avoid physical damages, thus Arquus developed its own family of energy-absorbing seats. Two models were visible at the TechnoDays event, one aimed at drivers and commanders in the front cabin, fitted with the whole set of height trimming, while the second was for dismounted troops in the rear compartment, and thus featured reclining seat, mobile headrest, etc, allowing full access to all the vehicles compartment that host the soldier’s equipment. According to Arquus its seats comply with road regulations and ensure protection against maximum STANAG 4569threat levels.\nAs for the RPG threat Arquus does not develop in house any solution but has developed integrating skills allowing to reduce as much as possible the impact of third-party systems on vehicles’ functionalities, cage-armour often having a detrimental impact on maintenance as it tends to interfere with panels openings. Last February the company unveiled at IDEX a solution against RPGs, known as Advanced Survivability System.\nOverall Arquus tends to be self-sufficient in most protection areas, while it does not aims at reinventing the wheel in some specific fields.\nPhotos by Paolo Valpolini","Bulletproof glass (also known as ballistic glass, transparent armor, or bullet-resistant glass) is a type of strong but optically transparent material that is particularly resistant to being penetrated when struck. Like any material it is not completely impenetrable. It is usually made from a combination of two or more types of glass, one hard and one soft. The softer layer makes the glass more elastic, so it can flex instead of shatter. The index of refraction for both of the glasses used in the bulletproof layers must be almost the same to keep the glass transparent and allow a clear, undistorted view through the glass. Bulletproof glass varies in thickness from 3⁄4 to 3 1⁄2 inches (19 to 89 mm).\nBulletproof glass is used in windows of buildings that require security, such as jewelry stores and embassies, as well as military and private vehicles.\nBullet-resistant glass is constructed using layers of laminated glass. The more layers there are, the more protection the glass offers. When a weight reduction is needed 3mm of polycarbonate (a thermoplastic) is laminated onto the safe side. This polycarbonate stops the spall. The aim is to make a material with the appearance and clarity of standard glass but with effective protection from small arms. Polycarbonate designs usually consist of products such as Armormax, Makroclear, Cyrolon, Lexan or Tuffak, which are often laminated as the final layer (Glass clad Polycarbonate).\nThe polycarbonate usually has one of two types of coating to resist abrasion: a soft coating that heals after being scratched (such as elastomeric carbon-based polymers) or a hard coating that prevents scratching (such as silicon-based polymers).\nThe plastic in laminate designs also provides resistance to impact from physical assault from blunt and sharp objects. The plastic provides little in the way of bullet-resistance. The glass, which is much harder than plastic, flattens the bullet, and the plastic deforms, with the aim of absorbing the rest of the energy and preventing penetration. The ability of the polycarbonate layer to stop projectiles with varying energy is directly proportional to its thickness, and bulletproof glass of this design may be up to 3.5 inches thick.\nLaminated glass layers are built from glass sheets bonded together with polyvinyl butyral, polyurethane, Sentryglas or ethylene-vinyl acetate. When treated with chemical processes, the glass becomes much stronger. This design has been in regular use on combat vehicles since World War II. It is typically thick and is usually extremely heavy.\n|Sample thickness and areal densities for bullet-resistant glass materials|\n|Threat Stopped||Glass Laminate||Polycarbonate||Acrylic||Glass-Clad Polycarbonate||Aluminum oxynitride|\n|in.||cm||lb/sq. ft.||kg/m2||in.||cm||lb/sq. ft.||kg/m2||in.||cm||lb/sq. ft.||kg/m2||in.||cm||lb/sq. ft.||kg/m2||in.||cm||lb/sq. ft.||kg/m2|\n|UL 752 Level 1||9 mm 3 shots||1.185||3.009||15.25||74.46||0.75||1.905||4.6||22.46||1.25||3.175||7.7||37.6||0.818||2.078||8.99||43.9|\n|UL 752 Level 2||.357 Magnum 3 shots||1.4||3.556||17.94||87.6||1.03||2.616||6.4||31.25||1.375||3.492||8.5||41.50||1.075||2.73||11.68||57.02|\n|UL 752 Level 3 (approximately NIJ IIIA)||.44 Magnum 3 shots (5 shots for NIJ IIIa)||1.59||4.038||20.94||102.24||1.25||3.175||7.7||37.6||1.288||3.271||14.23||69.47|\n|UL 752 Level 4||30-06 1 shot||1.338||3.525||14.43||69.47|\n|UL 752 Level 5||7.62 mm 1 shot|\n|UL 752 Level 6||.357 Magnum underloaded 5 shots|\n|UL 752 Level 7||5.56x45 5 shots|\n|UL 752 Level 8 (approximately NIJ III)||7.62 mm 5 shots||2.374||6.03||26.01||126.99|\n|UL 752 Level 10||.50 BMG 1 shot||1.6||4.06||30.76||150.1|\n9mm 124gr @1175-1293fps (1400-1530fps for Level 6), 357M 158gr @1250-1375fps, 44M 240gr @1350-1485fps, 30-06 180gr @2540-2794fps, 5.56NATO 55gr @ 3080-3388fps, 7.62NATO 150gr @2750-3025fps for all ratings in the above chart; all copper-jacketed lead FMJ, except 30-06 is semi-wadcutter gas-checked.\nBullet-resistant materials are tested using a gun to fire a projectile from a set distance into the material, in a specific pattern. Levels of protection are based on the ability of the target to stop a specific type of projectile traveling at a specific speed. Experiments suggest that polycarbonate fails at lower velocities with regular shaped projectiles compared to irregular ones (like fragments), meaning that testing with regular shaped projectiles gives a conservative estimate of its resistance. When projectiles do not penetrate, the depth of the dent left by the impact can be measured and related to the projectile’s velocity and thickness of the material. Some researchers have developed mathematical models based on results of this kind of testing to help them design bulletproof glass to resist specific anticipated threats.\nWell known standards for categorizing ballistic resistance include the following:\n- Summary of Euronational (EN) 1063 test conditions in English\n- Summary of Underwriter’s Laboratory (UL) ballistic resistance test conditions in English\n- U.S. Department of Defense specifications for purchase of transparent armor – includes standards for bullet resistance (ATPD 2352P).[permanent dead link]\n- U.S. National Insititute of Justice (NIJ) standard for ballistic resistant protective materials (NIJ Standard 0108.01).\nThe properties of bullet-resistant glass can be affected by temperature and by exposure to solvents or UV radiation, usually from sunlight. If the polycarbonate layer is below a glass layer, it has some protection from UV radiation due to the glass and bonding layer. Over time the polycarbonate becomes more brittle because it is an amorphous polymer (which is necessary for it to be transparent) that moves toward thermodynamic equilibrium.\nAn impact on polycarbonate by a projectile at temperatures below −7 °C sometimes creates spall, pieces of polycarbonate that are broken off and become projectiles themselves. Experiments have demonstrated that the size of the spall is related to the thickness of the laminate rather than the size of the projectile. The spall starts in surface flaws caused by bending of the inner, polycarbonate layer and the cracks move “backwards” through to the impact surface. It has been suggested that a second inner layer of polycarbonate may effectively resist penetration by the spall.\nIn 2005 it was reported that U.S. military researchers were developing a class of transparent armor incorporating aluminum oxynitride (ALON) as the outside \"strike plate\" layer. Traditional glass/polymer was demonstrated by ALON's manufacturer to require 2.3 times more thickness than ALON's, to guard against a .50 BMG projectile. ALON is much lighter and performs much better than traditional glass/polymer laminates. Aluminum oxynitride \"glass\" can defeat threats like the .50 caliber armor-piercing rounds using material that is not prohibitively heavy. Various types of other materials which closely resemble glass are also being developed.\nCertain types of ceramics can also be used for transparent armor due to their properties of increased density and hardness when compared to traditional glass. These types of synthetic ceramic transparent armors can allow for thinner armor with equivalent stopping power to traditional laminated glass.\nAir chamber glass\nThe newest type of curved transparent vehicle armor has an air chamber between the glass and the polycarbonate. Level IIIA (high speed 9mm) armor consists 8mm of laminated glass (strike face), a 1 mm air gap, and 7 mm of polycarbonate. This solution stops the bullets in a totally different way. The glass, being hard, deforms the incoming bullet. The deformed bullet completely penetrates the glass and then it is stopped by the flexible polycarbonate. The weight reduction over traditional glass-clad polycarbonate is 35 %, weighing 28 kilos per square meter. It is also thinner (16.2mm). The adjacent picture shows how the bullet is embedded between the glass and the polycarbonate.\n- Bertino, AJ, Bertino PN, Forensic Science: Fundamentals and Investigations, Cengage Learning, 2008, p. 407\n- \"Bullet Resistant Glass & Laminates: Military Vehicles Humvees Protection\".

Goldsmith grew up near the village of Lissoy, where the family moved in 1730. Goldsmith was disfigured by smallpox as a child. He was educated by the village schoolmaster, Thomas Byrne, and then at schools at Elphin, Athlone, and Edgeworthstown. Goldsmith showed early promise as a poet. He entered Trinity College, Dublin, in 1745, but only just graduated BA in 1750. While at university, he supported himself and his gambling habit by selling ballads. He studied medicine at Edinburgh University for two years, and in 1754 went to Leiden for further training. He abandoned the plan, however, and instead travelled on foot through France, Switzerland, Germany, and Italy. On his return to England in 1756, he worked as assistant to an apothecary, doctor (apparently without a medical degree), school-teacher, and writer. Goldsmith became a staff writer first on the The Monthly Review, and later on the rival Critical Review. He also contributed pieces to other periodicals, wrote biographies, and became a novelist. By 1760, he was established as a professional writer and made new friends, including Smollet, Thomas Percy, Samuel Johnson, Sir Joshua Reynolds, and the bookseller John Newbery. In 1764, he was a founder member of the Club, the literary association formed by Johnson, Burke, Sir Joshua Reynolds, Sir John Hawkins and others. Also in 1764, he completed and published his first major poem, The Traveller; or, A Prospect of Society. After his success as a poet, Newbery also published Goldsmith's collected Essays in 1765 and his novel, The Vicar of Wakefield, in 1766. Goldsmith edited two poetry anthologies in 1766 and 1767 and wrote a play, which was performed at Covent Garden in 1768. In 1769, Goldsmith was was appointed Professor of Ancient History at the Royal Academy at the suggestion of Reynolds. In 1770, he published The Deserted Village, his most famous poem, contrasting the innocent state of rural life with the evils of commercialism and enclosure. Goldsmith produced several historical and biographical works as well as continuing to write for the stage. Despite his many successes and his fame as a writer, Goldsmith was plagued by his prodigal habits throughout his life. In 1773, he had his greatest success as a playwright with She Stoops to Conquer. In 1774, Goldsmith increasingly suffered from bad health and had to seek treatment. His last poem, Retaliation, a series of mock epitaphs for his friends, remained unfinished.

He left a body of mostly unpublished work that has since cemented his place as one of Britain’s greatest poets.\nAll of Thomas’s 144 poems were written in the two and a half years leading up to his death. Almost immediately on its posthumous publication, his poetry came to speak for a rural England whose surviving people and culture had been decimated by four years of war. In a foreword to the 1920 Collected Poems, Walter de la Mare described Thomas’s poetry as “a mirror of England”, suggesting that it offered readers a portrayal of a rural nation that had been “shattered” by the catastrophic experience of World War I.\nThomas has become one of the most widely read English language poets of the 20th century. His Collected Poems has gone through numerous editions, and poems such as “Adlestrop” and “Old Man” have been widely anthologised.\nThomas has a deserved reputation as a poet with an unparalleled eye for the details of the natural world, managing through these observations to make some profound reflections on the human and environmental cost of war. His influence on subsequent generations of English poets is hard to overstate: former poet laureate Ted Hughes famously called Thomas “the father of us all”.\nThere has been plenty of discussion of Thomas’s work over the past few decades and yet there is one major aspect that has remained largely unexamined: his association with Wales.\nAn English poet?\nCalling Thomas an English poet belies his own complex national identity. Born in London to Welsh parents in 1878, Thomas made frequent trips back to Swansea and the Carmarthenshire areas of south Wales to stay with relatives. He had strong friendships with Welsh-language poets Watcyn Wyn and John Jenkins (“Gwili”), and later attended Lincoln College, Oxford from 1897 to 1900, where he was tutored by Owen M. Edwards, one of the most significant figures in nonconformist Welsh culture.\nEdwards awakened Thomas’s sense of Welsh national identity – after graduating he asked his former tutor “to suggest any kind of work … to help you and the Welsh cause”. Three years earlier, Edwards had called for “a literature that will be English in language and Welsh in spirit”, and it seems that Thomas took up his challenge, declaring that: “in English I might do something by writing of Wales”.\nWelsh in spirit\nThe visits to Gwili and Watcyn Wyn became more frequent and both poets feature in Thomas’s 1905 travel book Beautiful Wales. A description of Gwili fishing in a Carmarthenshire stream also features in one of three books of Wales-oriented sketches and short stories published by Thomas between 1902 and 1911: Horae Solitariae, Rest and Unrest, and Light and Twilight. These books are full of Welsh subject matter, including sketches, as well as adaptations of, and allusions to, Welsh folk material and literature.\nIn his review work for newspapers, Thomas lamented the lack of a widely circulated collection of Welsh folk tales, something that he himself put right in 1911 when he published Celtic Stories, an anthology of Welsh and Irish folk stories written “when Wales and Ireland were entirely independent of England”.\nWhile Thomas’s reputation as a quintessentially English writer rests largely on his poetry, it is now clear that even this is not as English as we previously thought. Welsh subject matter clearly creeps into some of his poems. The following verse from Words is a riddle-like reference to the tradition of Welsh bardic poetry:\nMake me content\nWith some sweetness\nHave no wings…\nThe lines below from Roads allude to Sarn Helen, the mythical Roman road linking fortresses in the north and south of Wales:\nHelen of the roads,\nThe mountain ways of Wales\nAnd the Mabinogion tales,\nIs one of the true gods\nRecently, however, we have realised that Thomas’s knowledge of Welsh-language poetic metres influenced his work too. Thomas’s poetry has long been regarded as innovative, but critics have tended to look for its origins in his relationship with American poet Robert Frost, the Imagism movement, or in the spoken voice.\nWhat we have missed is the formal crossover between Welsh-language literary forms and Thomas’s use of intricate sound patterns. The opening lines of “Head and Bottle”, for example, repeat the consonant sounds of “l”, “s” and “m” across the first line, and again in the second line. There is also the internal rhyme in “sun”, “sum” and “hum”:\nThe downs will lose the sun, white alyssum\nLose the bees’ hum\nThis is a clear example of cynghanedd, the intricate system of consonantal repetition and internal rhyme which is unique to Welsh-language poems.\nThomas certainly was one of the greatest English-language poets but, one hundred years on, it is becoming clear that he belongs just as much to an Anglophone Welsh literary tradition as he does to the literature of England.\nPhoto credit: Arthur St John Adcock/Wikimedia"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5329de79-b152-4d96-8c42-d68e040489d2>","<urn:uuid:522d0beb-47fd-4ddb-bbb3-f86caccf76d8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the main difference between Le Verre Francais and Schneider glass production lines?","answer":"Le Verre Francais produced cameo glass with several layers of etched glass featuring nature-inspired motifs in an abstract way, while the Schneider line did not represent nature scenery and typically had sand-blasted signatures. Le Verre Francais pieces were produced in higher numbers and are more common than the rarer Schneider pieces.","context":["Showing all 16 results\n- Object no. 5828\nSchneider Le Verre Français – “Fuchsia”\n- Object no. 4049\nSchneider, Le Verre Français – Art Deco coupe “rubaniers”\n- Object no. 3816\nSchneider, Le Verre Français – Coprins\n- Object no. 3287\nSchneider, Le Verre Français – Pichet Coprins\n- Object no. 2863\nDate-palm vase from Le Verre Français\n- SOLDVERKAUFTObject no. 3792\nSchneider – Orange-white coupe bijou\n- SOLDVERKAUFTObject no. 3856\nSchneider – Coupe Bijou (3)\n- SOLDVERKAUFTObject no. 3094\nSchneider – Large coupe\n- SOLDVERKAUFTObject no. 3789\nSchneider – Large coupe with matte glaze\n- SOLDVERKAUFTObject no. 3504\nSchneider – Halbrans\n- SOLDVERKAUFTObject no. 3615\nSchneider – Coupe Bijou (2)\n- SOLDVERKAUFTObject no. 2855\nSchneider Le Verre Français – Fig leaves\n- SOLDVERKAUFTObject no. 3513\n- SOLDVERKAUFTObject no. 3258\nSchneider – Very rare vase\n- SOLDVERKAUFTObject no. 3189\nSchneider, Le Verre Français – Scarabées\n- SOLDVERKAUFTObject no. 3122\nSchneider – Coupe a pied noir\nThe two brothers Charles and Ernst Schneider both worked for the factory Daum in Nancy in the beginning of the 20th century and there they learned the technique of blowing and etching the glass.\nIn 1913, just before World War I, they founded a factory of themselves in Epinay sur Seine and started tot develop a new style with more firm lines and more clear colors. The vases of the factory Schneider had already more features of the Art Deco than of the Art Nouveau. They imported new forms and new colors in the world of glass industry that was those days dominated by Daum and Galle.\nLe Verre Francais\nThey developed two production lines in the glass factory with two different styles: glass with the signature “Le Verre Francais” and the other line with only the signature “Schneider”.\nThe line of Le Verre Francais made cameo glass that existed out of several layers of etched glass. The motifs of the decorations were inspired by the nature, but were represented in a more abstract way and therefore the glass objects show a great difference with the style of the glass of the factory of Gallé or Daum.\nThey created their own specific style that you can recognize on the very contrasting colors on the glass object. For example notice the contrast between orange and yellow on many pieces of the factory Schneider-Le Verre Francais. Therefore the colors make nowadays a more modern impression and the art objects of the factory Schneider can be placed easily in a complete modern interior.\nThe vases of the line Le Verre Francais were produced in higher numbers than the art objects of the other line of this factory. These glass objects with only the signature “Schneider” are more rare to find and therefore rather expensive.\nSignatures and Originality\nThere are different signatures: Le Verre Francais on the foot of the vase and Charder (=Charles Schneider) in the middle of the vase. Sometimes both the signatures are represented on the vase.\nIn the early vases of the factory there is no signature at all or a small glass stick melted into the glass object with the three colors of the flag of France, the so-called “Berlingot flag”. When a vase has a small Berlingot flag than it is an early one made just after World War I.\nSee for the right patters and signatures the book: Charles Schneider, Le Verre Francais- Charder Schneider by Marie-Christine Joulin and Gerold Maier, Augsburg, 2004.\nThere are very good copies on the market nowadays and the forgers become more and more better. You can only recognize the originals by watching the details and also making mistakes. Only watching the signature you cannot recognize the fakes or the original ones.\nThe glass of this line of the factory exists also out of clear contrasting colors. But just not representing the scenery of the nature is the most important difference with the line of Le Verre Francais. The signature of the name of Schneider is mostly sand blast and underlined. The line started from the last character. Mostly is this blasted name difficult to read in the glass, it depends of the way the light falls in."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f0ba4263-ccd7-48ba-a041-dcd8171b378c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the legal protections for choreographic works compare to those for musical works under copyright law?","answer":"While musical works have explicit protection under copyright law, choreographic works face more ambiguous legal protection. The law makes no explicit mention of dance or movement, making dance copyright cases highly subject to interpretation. For musical works, the law clearly indicates protection for musical works including accompanying elements. In dance cases, lawyers often need to bring in dance experts like scholars or critics to establish similarity or difference between works, whereas musical copyright cases can rely more directly on the written law. Both types of works can be protected under copyright law and infringement can lead to monetary compensation exceeding $150,000, but the burden of proof differs significantly between the two art forms.","context":["“Imitation is the highest form of flattery,” the saying goes. Yet, taken to a certain extent, is it also theft? From concert dance to the competition world, choreographers have seen dance and said to themselves, “That looks just like my work…” High-profile examples of this phenomenon include Beyoncé’s “All the Single Ladies” video with choreography that’s just about a carbon copy of Bob Fosse’s Mexican Breakfast.\nNevertheless, it’s a complex issue because dance artists undoubtedly influence one another and learn from one another (from teachers, mentors or simply those they admire). We do want that kind of creative sharing, for the continuance and flourishing of dance as an art form and cultural asset. Established Copyright Law unfortunately doesn’t make things all that much clearer.\nYet, using our judgement and having open discussions can offer us some clarity here. Dance Informa spoke with a few dance artists with experience on this issue to help start such discussions — Noa Barankin, a Boston-based tap dance artist and artistic director for DrumatiX, with a background in Copyright Law studies; Joe Monteleone, NYC-based dance artist; and Vanessa Long, Artistic Director of Vanessa Long Dance Company. Let’s dive in!\nBarankin wants to first clarify that she’s not offering any kind of legal advice. She discusses the difference between mixing and re-shaping content (such as “rudiments” in tap dance — “time steps” and the like) and presenting as one’s own exactly what someone else created. This is one element that courts will consider in copyright infringement cases (a precondition there being that artists have their work copyrighted by registration).\nYet a difficult, arguably scary thing there is that even with copyrighting, how established U.S. law on copyrighting is written makes its application to dance vague and highly up to interpretation; it makes no explicit mention of dance, movement or many of its conventionally accompanying design elements (such as costuming, lighting and set design). In order to offer some concrete validity to an infringement case, given this undefined territory, Barankin says that lawyers will bring in experts — such as dance scholars or critics — to speak to similarity or difference in two pieces of dance art.\nAnother aspect that sometimes comes into question here is what Contracts and Labor Law says, Barankin says; most often, as specified in employment contracts, employers (let’s say, a dance studio owner or artistic director) gain ownership over their employees’ creative work. Yet, at times, contracts can say differently or omit this matter all together — particularly in cases of “freelance” or independent contractor employment. Barankin clarifies that if you work for hire, “the courts have tests in place to determine whether you are an employee or a contractor.”\nAll of that considered, Barankin plainly affirms that “it’s hard to protect your creative work as a dance artist. The courts might not always be on your side and lawyers might not always have all the answers, as the legal principles are fairly straightforward, yet there are a few underlying conflicting and contradictory ideas.” Much of it has to be left up to judgment calls.\nIn such personal judgment calls, Long discusses having certain personal “lines”, crossing them meaning — for her — crossing into plagiarism. For instance, she thinks copying a concept would not be plagiarism but that choreographing a work on the same concept in the same way would be; using a prop another artist used would not be plagiarism, but using a prop and a concept another artist used would be; having similar movements to those of another artist would not be plagiarism, yet using an entire phrase as a motif would be. Such judgment calls might differ for individual artists. What seems important is being mindful and intentional about where one stands on these questions.\nAll of that said, Long believes that being influenced by other artists happens, in ways that we sometimes can’t control or are even aware of. “Our brains our complicated, and it’s hard to discern from conscious and unconscious influence,” she says. “I believe all artists’ work is influenced unconsciously whether they realize it or not.”\nBarankin states, “People get inspired by things, and they try something out they saw, and before they know it, it’s the piece they saw.” Our minds, subconscious and unconscious, work in complicated ways!\nBarankin also thinks that sometimes people get dry of creative inspiration, and might truly wish that they could come up with something innovative of their own — yet they get inspired and find themselves using what they’ve seen, or more blatantly plagiarize. Monteleone agrees that this happens, and asserts that if he’s dry of inspiration, he’s just honest about it. If he’s on a tight timeline for creative work at such a time, he’ll bring back older work in repertory, for example.\nAnother element that the courts will consider in copyright infringement cases is monetary gain; if those who are accused of copyright infringement have monetarily benefited, that strengthens the case of those bringing charges, as there is then an argument that they are entitled to at least some portion of those monetary gains as damages. Short of the technical legality, Monteleone pulls apart the ethical issues there. “The money side of things is the darkest area of our art form,” he believes, with so many talented artists significantly struggling financially and phenomena like dancers not being paid running rampant.\nMonteleone also finds it sad and frustrating that so many talented artists out there are not getting the recognition they deserve. Monteleone adds that an aspect to keep in mind there, and in this larger issue of plagiarism and flattery, are logistics and language around program literature. In other words, programs and other promotional material should clearly credit all involved collaborators, as well as — where feasible — notable creative influences/influencers. Hierarchies and processes around curation of dance programming also seem key here; who is choosing what is presented, why, and is that process transparent?\nIn terms of monetary gains and ethics, another aspect with being influenced by another artist’s work to consider is if the original artist is still alive and how far back in time the work in question was created and released. As far as the law is concerned, Barankin explains, in the U.S., anything created before 1923 becomes public domain, as it’s no longer protected by Copyright Law. That means that the work is available for all to use as they will. Unless, that is, an estate has rights to the work copyrighted.\nIn that situation, they’d have a legitimate case to press copyright infringement charges and receive damages by a court ruling. The Martha Graham Estate failed to receive damages from an infringement court case because of the lack of copyright on Graham’s work, demonstrating the importance of copyrighting. Long, likely similarly to many dance artists, finds not holding a copyright on your work “terrifying”. Nevertheless, estates are indeed a way to secure copyrighting for decades or longer, but something to remember is that they must be legally reinstated (in other words, renewed) every 70 years.\nOther cases in which artists might fail to win copyright infringement cases is when work reproduced was protected under the “Fair Use” Doctrine, which establishes that works can be reproduced for the sake of commentary, criticism, or parody.\nOn the other hand, Barankin explains, “You cannot exploit someone’s intellectual property for your own commercial or personal uses and then look for a technicality or some specific legal reason why it ‘counts’ as Fair Use. Specifically, Fair Use is not usually an argument one can make when attempting to copy or perform someone else’s choreography. In almost all cases, if you intend on using someone else’s work, you need to license the rights before doing so.”\nLong also believes that simply having conversations on these matters will help us come to some sort of clearer consensus, as well as raise awareness, in the dance field. “I truly think the entire dance world would appreciate a set of rules and someone drawing that line,” she affirms. “I believe that most dancemakers have no interest in plagiarizing anyone’s work, and only a small group does this on purpose.”\nMonteleone says that he sees these conversations beginning to happen, “and you see the floodgates [of thoughts and feelings] open, which is a beautiful thing.”\nHe also wants to see artists advocate for themselves — such as those he’s seen have their work plagiarized by more well known artists, to only say something like, “It’s such an honor to be seen and recognized in that way by [said more well-known artist].” Looking at the objective morality of it all, it might indeed have been flattering for that lesser-known artist, yet they should have gotten recognition and at least some appreciable share of any monetary gain coming from such work. The law is one thing, and what is just and logical is another. Until the law is clearer, the dance world must be honest about what is indeed just and logical on this question around the line between flattery and plagiarism.\nBy Kathryn Boland of Dance Informa.","Copyright Infringement and Fair Use Guidelines\nWhat is Copyright Infringement?\nThe law of copyright indicates that copyright protection applies to works of authorship including but not limited to literary works, musical works (including any accompanying works), dramatic works (including any accompanying music), motion pictures and other audiovisual works and sound recordings. The owner of copyright has exclusive rights to, among other things, reproduce the copyrighted work and distribute copies of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer or ownership, or by rental, lease or lending.\nExamples of copyright infringement:\n- Copying the contents of someone else’s webpage or use of video clips or sound recordings without permission would in many cases be infringement.\n- Unauthorized duplication, distribution or use of someone else’s intellectual property, including computer software is copyright infringement and is illegal and is subject to criminal and civil penalties.\n- Unauthorized duplication and distribution of sound recordings.(e.g. MP3 format)\nWhat is Fair Use?\nIt is not an infringement of copyright if works used fall under the \"fair use\" exception of copyright law. Fair use extends to the reproduction of copyrighted material for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship or research. Factors used in determining if copyrighted material falls under the fair use exception includes, but are not limited to, whether the material is used for educational rather than commercial gain, the nature of the copyrighted work, how much of the entire work is used and the potential value of the copyrighted work.\nExamples of fair use:\n- Quoting passages from a book in a report for a class assignment.\n- Linking to someone else’s webpage in a report for a class assignment.\nWhat are the penalties for copyright infringement?\nAnyone who violates the exclusive rights of a copyright owner is an infringer of the copyright. Legal action available to the owner of the copyright includes obtaining an injunction preventing future infringement activity as well as monetary compensation that may exceed $150,000.00.\nWhy does the University need to respond to and investigate claims of copyright infringement? How will the university respond to a claim of copyright infringement on the university network?\nRider University is considered a service provider under copyright law. As a service provider, it must designate an agent to receive notifications of claimed infringements and make the name, address, phone number and electronic mail address of the agent available through its service, including on its website, in a location accessible to the public and by providing the same to the Copyright Office. If a service provider acquires knowledge of infringement, it must act \"expeditiously\" to remove, or disable access to the material, taking reasonable steps to notify the alleged infringing party (subscriber) that access to the material has been removed or disabled.\nThe subscriber has the right to counter notify the service provider that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification of the alleged infringing material. This counter notification must be in writing to the designated agent of the service provider and include the subscriber’s physical or electronic signature, identification of the material that has been removed or made inaccessible, and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed. Further, the counter notification must contain the subscriber’s name, address and telephone number and a statement that the subscriber consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is location. The subscriber must also indicate a willingness to be served papers in a legal proceeding from the complaining party.\nUpon receipt of the counter notification from the subscriber the service provider must promptly provide the complaining party with the counter notification. It must further inform the complaining party that it will replace the removed material or permit access to the same within 10 business days and then replace or make the material accessible not less than 10 nor more that 14 business days after receipt of the counter notification. However, if the complaining party notifies the agent that it is filing a court action seeking to restrain the subscriber from engaging in the infringing activity, the removal of or inaccessibility to the material must continue. The service provider may also be required, in the presence of a subpoena issued by the United States district court within its jurisdiction, to provide the identification of the alleged infringing party.\nThe service provider is obligated to inform its subscribers of a policy regarding the termination of access to its system or network for repeat offenders. This policy must not interfere with a copyright owners means of identifying and protecting copyrighted works on the service provider’s system and, at the same time, should not impose substantial costs or burdens upon either the service provider or its network.\nIn 2002, Congress passed the TEACH Act which, according to the American Library Association, “redefines the terms and conditions on which accredited, nonprofit educational institutions throughout the U.S. may use copyright protected materials in distance education-including on websites and by other digital means--without permission from the copyright owner and without payment of royalties.” (http://www.ala.org/Template.cfm?Section=distanceed)\nWhile the TEACH Act explicitly allows a wide variety of works to be uploaded to Learning Management Systems \"in an amount comparable to that which is typically displayed in the course of a live classroom session,” there are two categories of works that are explicitly excluded:\nThe following materials may not be used:\n- Works that are marketed \"primarily for performance or display as part of mediated instructional activities transmitted via digital networks\"; and\n- Performances or displays given by means of copies \"not lawfully made and acquired\" under the U.S. Copyright Act, if the educational institution \"knew or had reason to believe\" that they were not lawfully made and acquired. (http://www.ala.org/Template.cfm?Section=distanceed)\nFor example, no media of any sort (print, audio, or video) should be uploaded from “pirated” copies of the material. Nor should anyone be scanning and uploading substantial portions of textbooks or other instructional materials that are intended for each student to purchase.\nWho should you contact to report a claim of copyright infringement?\nContact the Copyright Infringement Complaint Coordinator,\nE-mail: [email protected].\nOTHER USEFUL CONTACT INFORMATION\nOffice of Information Technologies: Fine Arts Room 137, 896-5196.

{"question":"What tragic event happened to Aureet Bar-Yam in 1991?","answer":"Aureet Bar-Yam died on January 7, 1991, at the age of 33, drowning as she tried to pull her dog, Flame, out of the icy water of Sandy Pond in Lincoln, Mass.","context":["Compassionate Science for Humanity\n“Since time immemorial, humans have complained that life is becoming more complex. But it is only now that we have a hope to analyze formally and verify this lament.”\n— Yaneer Bar-Yam\nYaneer Bar-Yam personifies a unique alchemy of heart and intellect. He has the mind of a world-renowned physicist and mathematician with the ethos of a humanitarian. Yaneer has pioneered the field of complex systems, studying the interconnectedness of how our world works for the benefit of humanity. As the founder and president of the New England Complex Systems Institute, he gets to the bottom of some of the world’s most complicated problems through applied research and unique mathematical modeling. His widely cited and impactful work spans energy markets, global supply chains, economic and financial crises, military strategy, political instability, neuroscience, cell biology, public health and pandemics, including Ebola and COVID-19.\nEvolving as a Humanist\nBorn into a family of brilliant scientists, mathematicians and intellectuals, Yaneer was predestined for a career in math and science.\nHe was born on August 29, at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. His father, Zvi Bar-Yam, was born in Kraków, Poland, where he lived through the tragedy chronicled in the book and movie, “Schindler’s List.” As a survivor of the Holocaust, Zvi emigrated to Israel, where he met Yaneer’s mother, Miriam. They immigrated to the United States to initially study in Pittsburgh and then Connecticut, eventually moving to Brookline, Massachusetts, to raise their three children — Aureet, Yaneer and Sageet.\nZvi was a groundbreaking particle physicist and professor, trained at Carnegie Mellon University and MIT. And Miriam, educated at Harvard University, was a world-renowned authority on child developmental psychology. Zvi taught Yaneer mathematics even as his son was learning how to walk.\nIt was a joyous childhood, recalls Yaneer. “My mother believed in me. She made sure that I didn’t feel that I was better than others.” says Yaneer. “My father told me I don’t have to do everything. I just have to make a contribution.” He was close to his older sister, Aureet, and younger sister, Sageet. “Aureet taught me everything she knew in school,” says Yaneer.\nOne day in 1967, as an elementary student at Michael Driscoll School, in Brookline, Mass., Yaneer saw on television devastating images from halfway around the world that, unbeknownst to him, would become pivotal in charting the course of his life and work. The images were of starving children who were victims of the Nigerian civil war for the independence of a region called Biafra. Those images of wide-eyed, pot-bellied children touched Yaneer deeply and propelled him to make food security one of the pillars of his lifelong study of complex systems, offering real world, practical solutions to a pernicious problem.\nYaneer could have been anything he wanted to be. He loved math, science and chess, trained in piano and swam competitively, excelling in virtually everything he did.\nNaturally gifted, Yaneer finished high school in three years and graduated from MIT in 1978 after two years of study at the age of 18.\nAfter completing his bachelor’s degree in physics, he pursued applied physics at MIT and was awarded his Ph.D in 1984.\nMaking a Life-Changing Decision\nAn unexpected conversation took Yaneer on an entirely new trajectory in his career.\nYaneer may have continued on his academic path had it not been for a lecture he delivered on his research in theoretical physics. After his presentation, Yaneer asked an IBM scientist in attendance whether he had found the talk helpful. “No,” the scientist replied, bluntly adding that Yaneer’s analysis had zero practical impact on his applied work. Shocked by the negative review, Yaneer knew that he had to pivot and focus on meaningful, tangible outcomes from his research. It was a turning point in his life.\nFascinated by the emerging theory of complex systems – a rarefied, multidisciplinary study of how the parts of systems interconnect and collectively interact with their surroundings, Yaneer decided to apply his interest and physics training to find practical applications and real world solutions, becoming a joint postdoctoral fellow at MIT and IBM.\nOver the next decade, Yaneer held academic positions at the Weizmann Institute of Science and Cornell University, and he joined the faculty of Boston University as an associate professor of engineering.\nHis research addressed a diverse array of topics including the science of growing diamonds, the workings of neural networks and the underlying causes of climate change. But he found his true passion identifying the complex causes of global tragedies, such as food crises.\nAs a young academic, Yaneer experienced tragedy when his older sister, Aureet, died on January 7, 1991, at the age of 33, drowning as she tried to pull her dog, Flame, out of the icy water of Sandy Pond in Lincoln, Mass. Authorities botched the rescue effort in a long, drawn out series of failures. He not only lost a beloved sister but also a kindred spirit who had tutored him in the magic of mathematics when he was a young boy.\nAs a complex systems practitioner, Yaneer uses an innovative discipline of subterranean mathematical calculation to explain and predict global trends, such as food scarcity, ethnic cleansing, evolutionary biology, election outcomes, and pandemics, including COVID-19.\n“It’s the narrative of math. It’s all rooted in an understanding of multiscale analysis,” says Yaneer, who turned to Nobel Prize Laureate mathematician Ken Wilson’s 1970s principles of “renormalization group” to carry out his examination of complex systems.\n“Everybody studies in school how to use math. You have a set of equations, or you have an assumption. What can you prove? It’s set theory geometry,” says Yaneer. “When you know math really well, that’s really easy. The challenging part is making sure you have the right assumptions That’s the only thing that really matters. If you have the right assumption you can get the right conclusion.”\nRedoubling his efforts to make a tangible difference through applied science, Yaneer founded the New England Complex Science Institute in 1996. The institute is a multidisciplinary consortium of top academics who apply systems modeling and research to solve real-world problems.\nYaneer has attracted an illustrious community of international experts in complex science and related fields from Harvard, MIT, Yale and elsewhere working together to solve problems through applied science and modelling.\nLeading the Field\nYaneer had a prolific decade, publishing three books and more than 200 scientific papers.\nYaneer published his first book in 1997, a textbook, “Dynamics of Complex Systems,” while continuing to lecture around the world and creating an internationally recognized body of work with some of the top minds in the field. He holds four patents for some of his groundbreaking research.\nAs chair of the International Conference on Complex Systems, Yaneer has led an annual gathering of complex science experts for more than two decades. Through his Institute, he has published hundreds of expert presentations and papers on evolution, emergence, complexity, self-organization, scaling, informatics, time series, emergence of mind and engineering of complex systems.\nYaneer also has served as a visiting scientist at MIT Media Lab and a Visiting Scholar at both the Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology at Harvard and the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.\nYaneer explored some of the principles of Complex Systems in a 2002 paper titled, “Complexity Rising: From Human Beings to Civilization, a Complexity Profile.” “Since time immemorial, humans have complained that life is becoming more complex,” the paper began, “but it is only now that we have a hope to analyze formally and verify this lament.”\nThe paper, Yaneer said, was a journey into developing and understanding the so-called “complexity profile,” quantifying the “relationship between independence interdependence, and the scale of collective behavior.”\nIn 2004, Yaneer published his second book, “Making Things Work,” applied complex systems science to solving problems in healthcare, education, systems engineering, international development, and ethnic conflict.\nHis contributions to the field of applied complex science theory began to draw the attention of major institutions and world figures. Yaneer was invited to present his research and its applications to the World Bank Institute, the National Science Foundation and the United Nations among others.\nHis work has received grants from the Department of Defense, the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Bank. Yaneer has lectured widely on his research before numerous universities and foreign governments, as well as the World Health Organization, the U.S. Military Academy at West Point and the National Counterterrorism Center, among others.\nChampioning Data-Driven Decision Making\nAs the world grew increasingly more complex with the proliferation of global travel, Yaneer continued to apply his expertise to tackling global challenges like food insecurity, financial systems, terrorism and pandemics.\nNotably, in 2006, his work with a graduate student, Erik Rauch, analyzing how international human travel and livestock transport impacted pandemics broke new ground in pandemic modelling. Yaneer completed his student’s work after Rauch fell to his death in a hiking accident in California’s Sequoia National Park at the age of 31.\nWhen officials at the United Nations and in the U.S. government later approached Yaneer for help in 2008, he eagerly accepted the challenge to help policymakers address global crises through complex systems analysis. The chairman of the U.S. Senate Financial Services Committee, Rep. Barney Frank (D-Massachusetts) enlisted Yaneer’s aid in understanding and predicting the workings of world financial systems amid the economic crisis. Later, Yaneer advised the U.S. intelligence and defense communities on the root causes of global political instability.\nExpanding His Contribution\nYaneer did some of his most ground-breaking mathematical modeling and predicted that a growing food crisis would politically destabilize the Middle East.\nIn 2010, he went so far as to predict what came to be known as the Arab Spring long before unrest roiled the region toppling governments and sparking political violence. He earned international recognition for his predictive work, which was cited in publications around the world. Yaneer later advised President Obama’s chief defense policy advisor, Air Force Colonel Troy Thomas, on Egypt’s continuing political revolution and the rise of Mohammed Morsi and the Muslim Brotherhood. Subsequently publishes his analysis to wide acclaim with his findings cited by The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, and BBC among many other outlets.\nYaneer’s research on the dynamics leading to world food insecurity also garnered interest from global leaders and international organizations. He was invited to speak before the World Economic Forum in Davos and United Nations World Food Program on his key findings that agricultural policies in the developed world, especially the United States, had drastically disrupted global food supply chains and led to the unrest. At a dinner at the World Food Program’s summit, he sat alongside Archbishop Desmond Tutu, investment mogul and philanthropist Warren Buffet and his wife, Naomi, a constant support in his life and work. It was at that dinner, as he emotionally recounted to the illustrious guests his unforgettable memories of the 1967 Nigerian famine that Yaneer came to fully understand just how deeply those latent memories had impacted his life's work.\nYaneer’s work on food insecurity has earned accolades and recognition around the world.\nIn 2011, Wired Magazine named Yaneer’s work among top scientific discoveries and listed his scientific visualizations “Best of” that year. Two years later, in 2013, Vice’s Motherboard also recognized Yaneer’s work as “Best of.”\nHis research findings have been cited by The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, The Guardian, The Sunday Times, Die Zeit, Le Monde, Time, The Atlantic Monthly, Scientific American, Wired, Fast Company, Forbes, Slate, Mother Jones, Scientific-American, ABC News, Canada’s CTV, RT, BBC Radio, NPR Radio and Vice among others.\nEmbarking on a New Mission\nWhen the Ebola crisis began unfolding in West Africa in 2014, Yaneer quickly tapped his earlier work on global travel and pandemics and recognized a fundamental problem: what seemed like a local outbreak could have global repercussions. He turned his focus to finding a solution.\nBuilding on his earlier work on pandemics, Yaneer applied his complex systems research to find a way to end the outbreak. Partnering with international organizations and frontline workers, he developed mathematical models for arresting and eradicating the disease in Sierra Leone through containment, early detection and direct interventions. When the outbreak emerged in nearby Liberia the next year, Yaneer helped successfully apply that knowledge to slow and end the outbreak. He continued to advise U.S and international leaders and organizations on the pandemic risk and measures to halt the virus.\nLaunching a Movement\nMore recently, Yaneer has turned his attention to the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s a deeply personal crusade, having lost his mother to the deadly virus early in the pandemic.\nIn January 2020, building on his decades of expertise on pandemics, Yaneer co-authored a paper with “Black Swan” author Nassim Taleb, becoming one of the first pandemic experts to advise policymakers to limit international and domestic travel and take precautionary measures to slow the spread of the virus.\nSimultaneously, Yaneer also launched EndCoronavirus.org, a collaboration of more than 4,000 scientists, students, community leaders and other volunteers dedicated to eradicating COVID-19 through applied systems research.\nSince the COVID-19 outbreak, he has worked around the clock and across time zones to educate policy makers to help save lives, published op-eds with CNN and USA Today, advised leaders throughout the globe from Arizona to Israel and Ireland, recommending short but strict five-week phased lockdowns as a measured, localized, community based intervention to ending the pandemic.\nThrough his decades of rigorous research into complex systems such as wars, famines, pestilence, food scarcity, and pandemics, if there’s one thing Yaneer has learned, it’s this:\nmiscalculating the root causes of problems invariably results in flawed, even tragic, outcomes.\n“Wrong assumptions lead to wrong solutions,” says Yaneer. “The consequences are budgets squandered, years wasted, lives lost. The benefits of correct assumptions leading to tailored solutions are priceless. And you can only find the correct assumptions by starting with the right questions.”\nIn April 2020, Yaneer co-authors the paper, “COVID-19: How to Win,\" with scientist Chen Shen expanding on his recommendations to fight the virus. Yaneer consults with European governments on effective coronavirus response.\nThe next month, CNN.com publishes Bar-Yam’s op-ed warning that the state lockdown measures are insufficient, correctly predicting a summer resurgence of the virus. Yaneer helps to draft a petition to Virginia Governor Ralph Northam on behalf of hundreds of scientists and state residents calling for more urgent action against COVID-19.\nOn May 7, 2020, the human toll of the pandemic became starkly personal. That day, he wrote, “I have lost my mother to COVID,” he wrote on Twitter. “May her light shine bright forever in the places that truly matter.”\nYaneer reflected on the legacy of his mother, who had shaped his moral conscience as a scientist. “She taught me the meaning of the space of possibilities,” he wrote. “Aspiration never for self but always for improving the world for everyone. She gave me my responsibility.”"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f16dc65f-342e-4f5a-84aa-4655058ec9aa>"],"error":null}
