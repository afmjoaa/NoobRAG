{"question":"Getting prepped for my high-risk delivery - what emergency support and hospital care should I expect?","answer":"For high-risk deliveries, hospital birth is strongly recommended since they have the proper equipment, technology and staff to handle complications. During emergencies, ambulance crews will transfer you to the nearest available maternity unit (which may not be your nominated hospital), and in some cases you and your baby might need to travel in separate ambulances for safety. The ambulance staff will consult with maternity units for expert guidance. You should keep your pregnancy notes ready for emergency crews and inform them of any complications in your medical history. While high-risk pregnancy means greater unpredictability, early and regular prenatal care at a hospital with specialized facilities like a Newborn Intensive Care Unit makes it possible to have safe deliveries and healthy babies.","context":["Whilst pregnancy can be an exciting time; it can also be a time of worry. We want to reassure you that we are here to support you when emergencies arise.\nDuring pregnancy, you will be provided with the contact details for your named maternity unit or midwife.

Hearing that your pregnancy is high risk can amplify those worries. But a high-risk pregnancy doesn’t automatically mean that your pregnancy will be more difficult or that your baby won’t be healthy.\nWhat exactly does a high-risk pregnancy mean? Here are eight facts about high-risk pregnancies:\nThere are certain factors that can make a pregnancy high risk.\nA high-risk pregnancy means that extra care and monitoring is needed in order to have a healthy pregnancy and delivery. The following conditions may lead to a high-risk pregnancy:\nSome pregnancies can start low risk and become high risk.\nSome pregnancies start high risk and others become high risk as they progress. You may develop conditions while pregnant or during delivery, such as gestational diabetes or preeclampsia, that can put you in the high-risk category.\nSometimes the results of prenatal testing can make your pregnancy high risk. Prenatal testing can help you assess the risk that your baby will be born with a certain birth defect or genetic or chromosomal condition. Counseling is available after genetic screenings.\nDuring a high-risk pregnancy, your doctor will closely monitor you.\nIf your pregnancy is considered high risk, your doctor will closely monitor your health and the progression of your pregnancy. You may be referred to a maternal fetal medicine specialist.\nYou may have specialized testing during pregnancy to evaluate your developing baby. This may include more frequent prenatal visits, blood tests, regular fetal heart rate monitoring, chorionic villus sampling, amniocentesis, fetal echocardiography, detailed fetal ultrasound screening, glucose monitoring (if you have diabetes) and consultation for maternal or fetal problems.\nIt’s important to find a doctor with expertise in high-risk pregnancies.\nWomen with high-risk pregnancies should consider receiving care from a specialized team of doctors, including a maternal fetal medicine specialist (also called a perinatologist). A maternal fetal medicine specialist is an obstetrician-gynecologist (OB-GYN) with special training and experience in caring for women who have complicated or high-risk pregnancies. A maternal fetal medicine specialist will follow your baby’s growth and manage your health, to keep you both as healthy as possible.\nA hospital delivery is recommended for women with high-risk pregnancies.\nA hospital is the best option for high-risk pregnant women. Pre-term labor is common in high-risk pregnancies, especially for women having multiples. Also, sometimes a high-risk pregnancy can result in problems during labor. Hospitals have the proper equipment, technology and staff to closely monitor the birth process and handle complications if they arise.\nUnhealthy lifestyle habits increase your risk of problems during pregnancy.\nHow you take care of yourself during pregnancy is essential — especially when your pregnancy is high risk. Smoking, drinking alcohol or substance abuse increases your risk of problems. There is no safe level of smoking or drinking during pregnancy. Even a “light” habit can have devastating effects on your baby’s growth and development, such as miscarriage, prematurity, birth defects, growth deficiencies, stillbirth and sudden infant death syndrome.\nThere are things you can do to reduce high-risk pregnancy complications.\nIf your pregnancy is considered high risk, there are things you can do to increase your and your baby’s health and avoid pregnancy complications:\nIt’s possible to have a healthy baby even if the pregnancy is high risk.\nIt’s natural to have concerns about the health of your baby during a high-risk pregnancy. While high risk means there’s a greater chance of unpredictability in your pregnancy, it doesn’t guarantee there will be complications. Early, regular and good prenatal care makes it possible for many women with high-risk pregnancies go on to have safe deliveries and healthy, happy babies.\nAt the Maternal Fetal Medicine Clinic at Elmhurst Hospital and the Perinatology Center at Edward Hospital, you’ll receive expert care from physicians experienced in handling the most complicated cases for expectant mothers and newborns, including rare and complex conditions.

{"question":"How to use analog outboard gear during mixing in Logic Pro?","answer":"Use the I/O plug-in from the Utility folder to send signals out of Logic and back through the audio interface. Enable PDC (Plug-in Delay Compensation) and set it to 'All' to compensate for delay. For precise delay compensation across individual tracks, use a plug-in like Latency Fixer or Latency Bundle to manually enter delay settings in samples, measuring the delay by recording a rimshot sound through the outputs and back into Logic.","context":["We offer a second set of tips to enhance your corrective and creative mixing skills.\nLast month, I offered some tips and ideas to help with mixing in Logic Pro, focusing predominantly on setup and preparation for a mix, and then on ways of manipulating the bass and drums. In the concluding part of this series, having laid our foundation, we'll examine how we might further enhance our mix using various techniques and covering different mixing scenarios.\nThis is a common mixing complaint. Time‑based effects inherently take up large amounts of space in a mix. To minimise their clouding effect, you could try experimenting with panning, but it may be more useful to reduce the spectral range of the effects themselves. Try EQ'ing the aux returns for the effects or, if you prefer, the sends to the effects. Either way, the object is to thin out the sound of the reverb or delay, thus reducing the 'mud' around the direct sound. If, for example, a lead vocal is very sibilant, adding lots of delay will only create further problems with 's' sounds. Narrowing the frequency range of the delay can make the effect complement rather than detracting from the vocal. In Logic Pro, the Tape Delay plug‑in makes this easy, as it has a simple high/low‑cut filter, which you can see in the screen above. Reverb can also create 'mud' when added to a track. Try cutting in the 250‑500Hz area and using a low‑pass filter set at around 7kHz to thin out the sound. Like Tape Delay, the Space Designer reverb has its own EQ built in.\nHow can I make a vocal build throughout a track?\nBy changing effects or adding different effects in different sections of a song, you can give the impression of the vocal evolving. For example, the verse might just have a short delay, during the bridge you might then add a reverb, and in the chorus a doubler effect, giving each section a distinctive sound. This could be taken to the extreme by also changing the EQ for each section.\nIn Logic, you could implement this technique by placing all the effects on inserts and then bringing each one in by automating the bypass buttons on the effects. Alternatively — and possibly more flexibly — you could put the vocal processors on aux tracks and use sends from your vocal track, employing automation to not only control the send bypass but also the send amount. The screenshot at top right shows a vocal track being sent to a delay, doubler and reverb. As an aside, notice how easy it is to see the signal flow in the mixer using Single view rather than Arrange view! It's also easy to change the order of the plug‑ins or copy them in Logic Pro. Command‑drag to swap the plug‑ins around and use Option‑Command to copy a plug‑in.\nIs there an ideal order for a lead-vocal processing chain?\nThere are no hard and fast rules for the order of processes in a vocal chain, but each one may affect the others. I like to use EQ/Limiter/EQ/Compressor/De‑esser, but this is just a guide. The first EQ is for surgical changes, notching out unwanted artifacts or simply removing muddiness or sibilance. The limiter evens out any major level fluctuations. The second EQ is used to improve character and usually has a fairly gentle, shelf‑like design (a Neve/API type); I typically use it to add 'air' around 12kHz or warmth around 100Hz. The compressor is used to tighten the sound and possibly add some extra excitement, and will generally have a ratio of around 4:1 but may need to go as high as 20:1. Finally, a De‑esser is used, if necessary, to tame any excessive sibilance.\nMy individual tracks sound great in isolation, but some sounds seem to disappear once they are in the mix.\nThough this might simply be an EQ problem with certain sounds in your mix (some sounds don't need to actually be that 'big' to cut through!), it could also be a phase‑cancellation problem. In adjusting the phase, you are effectively changing the time relationship between sounds, and you could experiment by literally inserting very short delays, but as a starting point it's far easier to simply reverse the phase between tracks (Logic's Gain plug‑in has a phase‑reverse button and also has the ability to swap the left and right channels). For example, we could try 'flipping' the phase between a DI'd bass and the same bass recorded via a miked‑up amplifier, and between the hi‑hat and the snare mics. Typically, some sounds may become 'thin' or, in extreme cases, seem to be coming from behind your head! This phenomenon can sometimes be used to your advantage, to make backing vocals or synth pads appear to come from beyond the speakers.\nWhat's parallel compression, and how can I use it in Logic Pro?\nParallel compression, sometimes known as New York compression, is a process whereby the dry signal is mixed with a heavily compressed version of an identical signal — like using a compressor with a Wet/ Dry knob! The effect becomes extremely useful when you use buses to control the amount sent from an audio or instrument track to an aux return object. While still maintaining the dynamic range and imaging of the original, unprocessed signal, you can use very extreme compression settings on the compressed version to add excitement to your track. (You're not restricted to using compression, and could just as easily add parallel EQ.)\nThe technique is easily set up in Logic by placing a compressor on an aux track fed from a bus, as shown in the screenshot above. The compressor is set up with very extreme settings, making it easy to hear the effect of adding the parallel compression.\n• Insert a send on an audio or software instrument track, and route the signal to an unused bus.\n• On the aux track that Logic has created, insert a compressor plug‑in.\n• Adjust the settings of the compressor to give quite an extreme, aggressive effect (fast attack and release, high ratio and plenty of gain reduction).\n• Make sure the aux send on the source track is set to pre‑fade so that any level adjustments on the direct signal will not affect the level of the processed signal.\n• Adjust the level of the compressed aux track to add it to the unprocessed signal.\nWhen it comes to mixing, Logic can seem like a daunting piece of software for less experienced users. However, keeping the screen uncluttered and carefully controlling what you are displaying, as explained last month, makes the process, certainly visually, far more intuitive. Adopting a method and evolving a set of 'go to' techniques also greatly adds to the enjoyment of the job. Mixing is meant to be like painting a picture, not running a marathon, so the more we keep the technology under control, the less arduous the task will be. It's worth noting that even experienced mixers hit barriers; here's a final thought from one of the world's greats, George Massenburg: \"A mix is never finished, you just have to abandon it!”.\nI want to use my analogue outboard gear during mixing in Logic. How do I do this?\nLogic has an I/O plug‑in, found in the Utility folder, which enables you to send a signal out of the software and back through the audio interface you're using. As long as PDC (Plug‑in Delay Compensation) is set to 'All', the delay incurred by the process of going out and coming back in will be compensated for by Logic. But what Logic cannot do is measure the exact delay incurred by a specific audio interface. It can only make a generic setting for delay compensation. This is obviously not a problem if you're inserting an effect across your stereo bus, as all audio is travelling down the same path and will be delayed by the same amount, but if you're inserting across individual tracks this could be a problem.\nTo deal with this issue, I use a plug‑in called Latency Fixer, made by Expert Sleepers. The plug‑in, when used in conjunction with Logic's own I/O utility, enables me to manually enter a delay setting, in samples, which Logic can then use to exactly compensate for the delay created by the sound travelling out of the audio interface and back again. The sample delay measurement might be made by sending out a rimshot sound or similar percussive sound that you've recorded, through the outputs of the audio interface and recording it back into Logic. If we zoom in on the waveforms it is then easy to see and measure the delay between the two. Artificial Audio's Latency Bundle is also very effective at getting round this problem, and does all the hard work for you without the need to record audio back into Logic.\nWhy do my mixes never sound as wide as my favourite records?\nI believe it was Bob Clearmountain who once said that if everything in a mix is in stereo, what you wind up with is two lots of mono!\nWhat he is getting at is if all the source material is recorded in stereo, with a left and a right side panned to the extreme sides of a mix, you wind up with very little direct weight in the centre and, more importantly, no real sense of individual sounds placed in a stereo field. It's far more effective, and often produces much more impact, to place the kick, snare, bass and vocal in the middle and the guitar coming from just the left side, for instance, with maybe piano just from the right. This is over‑simplified, but to create an interesting stereo balance it's best to have things occupying their own place in the stereo field rather than competing for a space with other instruments. In Logic, the Direction Mixer, found in the Imaging plug‑in submenu, can be used to great effect to pan stereo source material to either side of the stereo spectrum."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:88fde1f9-dd8e-4e7d-97a5-50e3511e7504>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the connection between Jean Malin and Alcide Nunez in terms of their final performances before death?","answer":"Jean Malin and Alcide Nunez had contrasting final performances before their deaths. Malin died immediately after giving a 'farewell performance' at the Ship Cafe in Venice, California, when he accidentally drove his car off a pier in 1933. Nunez, on the other hand, spent his final performing days as part of the police band in New Orleans until his death from a heart attack in 1934.","context":["This entry is dedicated to George Chauncey, whose masterful erudition recovered Jean Malin's biography from oblivion. My heartfelt thanks for his generous permission to use such hefty quotes from his historical study Gay New York: Gender, Urban Culture, and the Making of the Gay Male World, 1890-1940 (BasicBooks, 1994).\n* * *\nWhen I first saw Alfred Hitchcock's Rebecca (1940), I was thrilled by a scene towards film's end where Laurence Olivier's character Maxim DeWinter reveals to Joan Fontaine—whose name we are never given; she is simply characterized as \"the Second Mrs. DeWinter\"—exactly how Rebecca, the First Mrs. DeWinter, met her untimely death. He describes her final movements evocatively, cueing the camera's pan across the room, so that you all but see Rebecca moving around the room, you hear her scoffing laughter, you are seduced by her cool ruthless beauty. Through the camera's intent notation of her absence, Rebecca's presence is vividly summoned. It is a masterful stroke of insinuation, of conjuration, that Hitchcock utilized once again in Rope (1948) when Jimmy Stewart's character Rupert Cadell pieces together how Brandon Shaw (John Dall) and Phillip Morgan (Farley Granger) have done away with David Kentley. Hitchcock's conceit became one of my first articulations of how someone's absence can become a palpable presence; what Raymond Carver calls \"the white shadow.\"\nThere are, of course, the absences created by narrative deaths, characters who leave a story through the plot's permutations, and then there are absences created by the omissions and erasures of calculated censorship; but, the dynamic remains essentially the same—a presence is created through absence. If you are a marginalized individual—a gay male, let's say—who cannot find images of himself in the mainstream culture, then you develop the facility to mine the margins for representation, to read between the lines, and to locate presence in absence. The sheer fact of an absence of representation incites and encourages such compensatory strategies.\nIn his landmark study, Outlaw Representation: Censorship and Homosexuality in Twentieth-Century American Art (Oxford University Press), Richard Meyer argues for a \"dialectical concept of censorship\" whereby \"the censorship of visual art functions not simply to erase but also to enable representation; it generates limits but also reactions to those limits; it imposes silence even as it provokes responses to that silence.\" (2002:15) Adapting the concept of \"structural absences\" introduced by Pierre Macherey in his volume A Theory Of Literary Production (which describes how literary texts are shaped by their own absences and avoidances), Meyer mines the cultural and material absence of queer art within the public sphere to sift out its presence within twentieth-century American culture from the forces of censorship that sought to eradicate it. (2002:291, fn. 52.)\nWhen Richard Barrios indicated to me during our recent conversation that the one film added to the TCM Screened Out lineup that had not been included in his eponymous book was the comedy-drama Double Harness (1933), he provided a good reason: the film had simply not been available for nearly 50 years and was only recently brought to light due to resolution of a longstanding legal dispute between King Kong creator Merian C. Cooper and former RKO and Selznick International Pictures finance executive Ernest L. Scanlon (the details of which can be gleaned from the TCM press release). But there was an equally good reason for Barrios to include Double Harness in the Screened Out program; namely, that Jean Malin was not in the film. His absence is historically important. As the TCM press notes point out: \"Jean Malin, who had gained fame as a female impersonator in the 1920's and was part of the so-called 'pansy craze' of the early 1930's, was originally cast as dress-shop owner Bruno in the opening scenes. He filmed the sequence and can still be seen in some publicity stills. But the scenes were reshot with Fredric Santley, at the then-sizeable cost of $1,669, after RKO executives ruled that Malin was too flamboyant a presence even for those liberal times. Studio president B.B. Kahane wrote in an inter-studio memo that 'I do not think we ought to have this man on the lot on any picture—shorts or features.' \"\nIt's odd to watch a film to gain a sense of an actor who's not in the film. But as Double Harness was available on Comcast On Demand—and intrigued enough to take a look before its Screened Out broadcast—I took a look at Double Harness.\nWikipedia's succinct profile of the \"brief meteoric rise of the career/phenomenon of Gene (Jean) Malin\" is unabashedly dependent upon George Chauncey's excellent discussion on Malin and the phenomenon of the Pansy Craze, Chapter 11—\"Pansies on Parade: Prohibition and the Spectacle of the Pansy\"—from his fascinating study Gay New York: Gender, Urban Culture, and the Making of the Gay Male World, 1890-1940 (BasicBooks, 1994).\nGene Malin, Wikipedia writes, was born Victor Eugene James Malin in Brooklyn on June 30, 1908 to working class Polish/Lithuanian parents. He had two brothers and two sisters. As a child, Gene attended P.S. 50 in Brooklyn and then went on to Eastern District High School for a while. One brother became a cop the other worked for a sugar refinery, but Gene had other inclinations early on. As a teenager Gene was already winning prizes for his costumes at the elaborate Manhattan Drag Balls of the 1920s. [Chauncey claims he \"was said to have won prizes for an outfit of black velvet and silver lace and for several other more exotic creations consisting entirely of pink or gold feathers\" (1994:314).] By his late teens Malin had worked as a chorus boy in several Broadway shows (\"Princess Flavor\", \"Miami\", \"Sisters of the Chorus\") [but lost several jobs because he was too effeminate]. Around the same period, Malin worked at several Greenwich Village clubs as a drag performer, [first at Paul and Joe's but] most notably the \"Rubaiyat\".\nSeveral columnists noted his talent and in 1930 (age 22) Malin was booked at Louis Schwartzs' elegant \"Club Abbey\" at 46th and 8th Ave. It was at this point that Malins' career and fate took a most interesting turn. Although Malin was at times assisted by \"Helen Morgan JR.\", a popular drag artist of the day, he did not appear in drag himself. The crux of his act was not to impersonate women, but to appear as an openly gay male (emphasis on the Male). Here he moved on stage and amongst the audience members as tuxedo clad, elegant, witty, wisecracking Emcee, Master of Ceremonies. He still often resorted to a broad exaggerated swishing image and the many other such \"Pansy acts\" that followed—often had a tone of a straight vaudeville man doing an exaggerated impersonation of an effeminate \"Pansy\". Perhaps the joke had several levels—as the performer was often a gay man doing his impression of a straight man doing his impression of a gay man. (Shades of Victor Victoria, anyone?) Regardless, in doing so, Malin and other such performers as \"Karl Norman\" and \"Ray Bourbon\" ignited a \"Pansy Craze\" in New York's speakeasies and later in other cities as well. Malin became the top earner of Broadway for a time. After headlining numerous New York Clubs, he took his act to Boston and ultimately to the West Coast. While in Hollywood, he appeared in several films (such as Arizona to Broadway and Joan Crawford's Dancing Lady) usually as the stock character of a witty limpwristed clerk.\nIn the early hours of August 10, 1933, Gene Malin was killed in a freak accident. He had just performed a \"farewell performance\" at the \"Ship Cafe\" in Venice California. He piled into his sedan with roommate Jimmy Forlenza and Comedic actress Patsy Kelly. It seems that Malin confused the gears and the car lurched in reverse and went off a pier into the water. Malin was instantly killed (pinned under the steering wheel) the other two were seriously hurt, but miraculously survived. It is staggering to realize that Malin was only 24 years of age at the time of his death. Although many in his audience probably saw him as one more oddity, in a short span of time Malin had made and changed the course of history!\nMalin left behind two recordings, released posthumously and pressed in a single royal blue shellac 78, \"That's What's the Matter With Me\" and \"I'd Rather Be Spanish Than Mannish\"; the latter can be heard here.\nThe Queer Music Heritage site has a great video clip of Malin in Arizona to Broadway (1933), perhaps the earliest clip of a performance by an actual female impersonator. Malin had an uncredited role as Ray Best, a female impersonator who's conspicuously channeling Mae West. Synopsis: Gangster Tommy Monk wants to have a Broadway show so at gunpoint he coerces Malin, Jimmy Durante and Ed Wynn to perform.\nThere are a couple of things that strike me in this wonderful and valuable video clip. First, as indicated above, this was not Malin's characteristic representation. He normally did not perform in drag. He performed as a pansy, not a female impersonator. Chauncey writes (1994:315): \"By the time Malin moved his act from the Village to the Club Abbey, he had transformed his stage role from that of a female impersonator to that of a pansy. A large and imposing man, he strolled about the club, interacting with the patrons and using his camp wit to entertain them (and presumably scandalizing them with his overtly gay comments). …Malin's 'act' was simply to bring the camp wit of the gay subculture from Greenwich Village to the floor of one of the city's swankiest clubs, although virtually no evidence remains concerning the precise content of that act. He 'wore men's clothes,' one paper explained, 'but [he] talked and acted like women.' Some newspapers continued to call him a female impersonator, even though he wore men's clothes; others called him a male impersonator, as if his male clothes were the only manly thing about him.\"\nWhat is of equally distinctive importance here is that Malin gained notoriety for being \"a pansy playing a pansy.\" Chauncey clarifies (1994:316): \"Malin, in other words, was regarded as a gay man whose nightclub act revolved around his being gay, not as a 'normal' man scornfully mimicking gay mannerisms or engaging in homosexual buffoonery, as was the case in most vaudeville and burlesque routines.\" Further, Malin's nightclub act disrupted conventional spatial arrangements between performer and audience. He was not isolated on a stage; he wandered freely among the Club Abbey clientele, frequently ridiculing the straight men who heckled him.\nChauncey expounds (1994:317): \"His very presence on the club floor elicited the catcalls of many men in the club, but he responded to their abuse by ripping them to shreds with the drag queen's best weapon: his wit. 'He had a lisp, and an attitude, but he also had a sharp tongue,' according to one columnist. 'The wise cracks and inquiries of the men who hooted at his act found ready answer.' And if hostile spectators tried to use brute force to take him on after he had defeated them with his wit, he was prepared to humble them on those terms as well. 'He was a huge youth,' one paper reported, 'weighing 200, and a six footer. Not a few professional pugilists sighed because Jean seemed to prefer dinner rings to boxing rings.' Although Malin's act remained tame enough to safeguard its wide appeal, it nonetheless embodied the complicated relationship between pansies and 'normal' men. His behavior was consistent with their demeaning stereotype of how a pansy should behave, but he demanded their respect; he fascinated and entertained them, but he also threatened and infuriated them.\"\nOne instantly recognizes the precedent Malin set for subsequent performances such as Terrence Stamp's Ralph/Bernadette Bassenger in The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert (1994), not only by his actions in the video clip from Arizona to Broadway but through his own life. \"A story told about Malin highlights the image he developed as a street-smart defender of his dignity as a gay man and the degree to which his fans thought his stage and offstage personas were one and the same. Published in the Daily Mirror after he had become famous, and presumably circulating in the gay world before then, the story explained that after winning the prize for being the 'best-dressed woman' at a Greenwich Village drag ball, he had wandered into a cafeteria without having bothered to change his clothes. This was … a common step for a man to take after experiencing the heady solidarity of a drag ball, and the heckling he started to receive from some of the other customers at the cafeteria was also fairly routine. But what happened next was not. 'When a party of four rough looking birds tossed a pitcher of hot water at him as he danced by,' the columnist reported, 'he pitched into them. After beating three of them into insensibility, the fight went into the street, with two taxi drivers coming to the assistance of the surviving member of the original foursome.' The story portrayed Malin as claiming his right to move openly through the city as a drag queen. Still, it ended on a suitable camp note. When the fight was over, Malin was said to have had tears in his eyes. Yes, he'd won the fight, he told another man, 'but look at the disgraceful state my gown is in!' \" (Chauncey, 1994:317-318.)

He was also one of the first musicians of New Orleans who made numerous audio recordings and he was announced by Pee Wee Russell as the greatest jazz clarinetist of the world.\nAlcide Patrick Nunez was born in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana. His parents were Victor Nunez and Elisa Nunez Chalaire and were of Isleño and Louisiana French descent respectively. The family moved to New Orleans when he was a child.\nHe grew up amid the Marigny and Bywater districts of New Orleans. For a time, Nunez lived at 1340 Arts Street, in the St. Roch neighborhood of New Orleans. He initially played guitar, then switched to clarinet about 1902. He soon became one of the top hot clarinetists in the city. By 1905 he was a regular in Papa Jack Laine's band, in addition to playing with Tom Brown and sometimes leading bands of his own. Nunez could play several instruments, but mainly played the clarinet. In addition, he was able to improvise variations on the songs he heard. Before he was able to make music a full-time profession, Nunez worked for a while driving a mule-drawn wagon with fellow musician \"Chink\" Martin Abraham.\nIn early 1916 he went north to Chicago with Stein's Dixie Jass Band, which was to become famous as the Original Dixieland Jass Band, but Nunez left the band shortly before they made their first recordings. In 1917 the Dixieland Jass Band achieved great success with their recording of the instrumental \"Livery Stable Blues\" under the direction of Nick LaRocca; however, Nunez and Ray Lopez filed copyright for a sheet music version of the tune before LaRocca. Nick LaRocca and the band sued Nunez for $10,000. In the end the lawsuit was thrown out without decision; the judge denied that any \"musicians\" who could not read written music could be said to have written anything.\nAfter some time playing with Tom Brown's band in Chicago, he went to New York City with Bert Kelly's band. Pee Wee Russell announced in Chicago and New York that Nunez was the greatest jazz clarinetist of the world. Nunez became Bert Kelly's band leader. After playing with Kelly through 1918, at the start of 1919 Nunez helped form the band the Louisiana Five, led by drummer Anton Lada. They quickly became one of the most popular bands in New York at the time and recorded for several record labels. In early 1920 Nunez worked with the New York dance band of Harry Yerkes, but in the same year returned temporarily to the Louisiana Five, touring the United States.\nIn 1922, after Bert Kelly replaced him with Johnny Dodds, he returned to Chicago to lead the house band at Kelly's Stables, one of the city's top nightclubs and played with the band of Willard Robison. Soon thereafter Nuñez began to lose his teeth, impairing his ability to play clarinet professionally. He returned to his family in New Orleans, but after getting dentures found he was still able to play. He obtained a job with the police department, also playing with the police band, and remained in New Orleans until his death.\nNunez married three times, had one child with his second wife and three children with his third. For a time in 1921, he settled in Baltimore, where he bought a large house.\nHe died September 2, 1934, of a heart attack.\n|Wikimedia Commons has media related to Alcide Nunez.|\n- Alcide \"Yellow\" Nunez at the Wayback Machine (archived May 29, 2005) extensive multi-page biography."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7de2e70e-2f94-4656-9fab-4de646be0c9a>","<urn:uuid:fa23623a-9862-4dd0-a894-9d6a60b72649>"],"error":null}
{"question":"how many complications chronic pancreatitis cause + what happens in pancreas during disease?","answer":"In chronic pancreatitis, different complications were found in 39 (36.7%) patients, including biliary hypertension in 24.5% of patients, chronic duodenal obstruction in 9.4%, and a combination of these with local venous hypertension in 3.8% of cases. During the disease, the digestive enzymes that the pancreas normally produces attack the pancreas itself, causing severe abdominal pain. The main cause of acute pancreatitis is gallstones blocking the common bile duct, while excessive alcohol consumption can lead to chronic pancreatitis. The condition involves progressive fibrous degenerative changes in pancreatic tissue, which impairs the pancreas's ability to produce essential digestive enzymes and hormones.","context":["106 patients with chronic pancreatitis (CP) underwent surgery at the department of surgery of the Ivano-Frankivsk Regional Clinical Hospital during 2009-2014, including 97 (90.5 %) men and 9 (9.5 %) women. Six of these patients had had previous CP surgeries (2 patients had had longitudinal pancreatico-jejunostomy, 3 – endoscopic interventions in extrahepatic biliary tract, and 1 – endoscopic stenting of Wirsung’s duct). However, due to progressive fibrous degenerative changes in pancreatic tissue they required a repeated surgery. Different complications of CP were found in 39 (36.7 %) patients: biliary hypertension (BH) in 26 (24.5 %) patients, chronic duodenal obstruction (CDO) in 10 (9.4 %) patients, combination of CDO and BH and local venous hypertension of pancreatico-biliary area – 4 (3.8 %) patients. Before the operation, diabetes mellitus had been diagnosed in 11(10.4%) patients.\nProximal resection surgeries on pancreatic head were applied in 27 (25.5%) cases, among them: 4 patients underwent pancreatico-duodenal resection, 23 patients – duodenum preserving procedures (including 2 cases according to Beger in Berne modification, and 21 Frey’s procedures). Berne procedure was conducted in 2 male patients 34 and 44 years old. Frey’s procedure was used in 21 cases: 20 male and 1 female patient. Average age of patients is 44±6.6. Four patients (three men and one woman 45.3±8.4 years old) underwent pancreaticoduodenal resection. Two out of 27 patients died (postoperative mortality comprised 7.4%).\nProximal resection procedures on pancreatic head are pathogenetically reasoned in cases of fibrous-degenerative forms of chronic pancreatitis, and allow to eliminate pain syndrome and malfunction of adjacent organs. A significant number of postoperative complications of pancreatic resection surgeries is connected primarily with the injury of pancreatic tissue, and requires less traumatic surgery techniques following specific indications.\nBordin, D.

It is located inside your abdomen, just behind your stomach. It's about the size of your hand. During digestion, your pancreas makes pancreatic juices called enzymes. These enzymes break down sugars, fats, and starches. Your pancreas also helps your digestive system by making hormones. These are chemical messengers that travel through your blood. Pancreatic hormones help regulate your blood sugar levels and appetite, stimulate stomach acids, and tell your stomach when to empty.\nYour pancreas creates natural juices called pancreatic enzymes to break down foods. These juices travel through your pancreas via ducts. They empty into the upper part of your small intestine called the duodenum. Each day, your pancreas makes about 8 ounces of digestive juice filled with enzymes. These are the different enzymes:\nLipase. This enzyme works together with bile, which your liver produces, to break down fat in your diet. If you don't have enough lipase, your body will have trouble absorbing fat and the important fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K). Symptoms of poor fat absorption include diarrhea and fatty bowel movements.\nProtease. This enzyme breaks down proteins in your diet. It also helps protect you from germs that may live in your intestines, like certain bacteria and yeast. Undigested proteins can cause allergic reactions in some people.\nAmylase. This enzyme helps break down starches into sugar, which your body can use for energy. If you don’t have enough amylase, you may get diarrhea from undigested carbohydrates.\nMany groups of cells produce hormones inside your pancreas. Unlike enzymes that are released into your digestive system, hormones are released into your blood and carry messages to other parts of your digestive system. Pancreatic hormones include:\nInsulin. This hormone is made in cells of the pancreas known as beta cells. Beta cells make up about 75% of pancreatic hormone cells. Insulin is the hormone that helps your body use sugar for energy. Without enough insulin, your sugar levels rise in your blood and you develop diabetes.\nGlucagon. Alpha cells make up about 20% of the cells in your pancreas that produce hormones. They produce glucagon. If your blood sugar gets too low, glucagon helps raise it by sending a message to your liver to release stored sugar.\nGastrin and amylin. Gastrin is primarily made in the G cells in your stomach, but some is made in the pancrease, too. It stimulates your stomach to make gastric acid. Amylin is made in beta cells and helps control appetite and stomach emptying.\nCommon pancreatic problems and digestion\nDiabetes, pancreatitis, and pancreatic cancer are three common problems that affect the pancreas. Here is how they can affect digestion:\nDiabetes. If your pancreatic beta cells do not produce enough insulin or your body can’t use the insulin your pancreas produces, you can develop diabetes. Diabetes can cause gastroparesis, a reduction in the motor function of the digestive system. Diabetes also affects what happens after digestion. If you don't have enough insulin and you eat a meal high in carbohydrates, your sugar can go up and cause symptoms like hunger and weight loss. Over the long term, it can lead to heart and kidney disease among other problems.\nPancreatitis. Pancreatitis happens when the pancreas becomes inflamed. It is often very painful. In pancreatitis, the digestive enzymes your pancreas make attack your pancreas and cause severe abdominal pain. The main cause of acute pancreatitis is gall stones blocking the common bile duct. Too much alcohol can cause pancreatitis that does not clear up. This is known as chronic pancreatitis. Pancreatitis affects digestion because enzymes are not available. This leads to diarrhea, weight loss, and malnutrition. About 90% of the pancreas must stop working to cause these symptoms.\nPancreatic cancer. About 95% of pancreatic cancers begin in the cells that make enzymes for digestion. Not having enough pancreatic enzymes for normal digestion is very common in pancreatic cancer. Symptoms can include weight loss, loss of appetite, indigestion, and fatty stools.\nYour pancreas is important for digesting food and managing your use of sugar for energy after digestion. If you have any symptoms of pancreatic digestion problems, like loss of appetite, abdominal pain, fatty stools, or weight loss, call your healthcare provider.\nMarch 22, 2017\nUp To Date.

{"question":"How does water infrastructure serve as a lens for studying social inequality, and what are the current challenges in mandatory recycling symbols for water-related products in France?","answer":"Water infrastructure reveals social inequality by serving as a window into citizen-state relations, particularly in contexts where poor and informal groups have been historically excluded from state-provided water networks. In Bangalore, for example, market-oriented reforms in the water sector highlighted issues of access and sparked grassroots responses. Regarding recycling symbols in France, while water-related products must display the Triman logo to indicate recyclability, there are complications with this requirement. The mandatory marking system has faced challenges, including low compliance rates, consumer confusion due to multiple logos, and lack of European-wide harmonization, making it potentially contradictory to its aim of simplifying waste sorting activities.","context":["Decolonizing Infrastructure in India and the US: A Conversation with Malini Ranganathan\nRecently, many scholars in the humanistic social sciences have begun to focus on the more-than-human agency of nonhuman natures, things, objects, and materials. Within this posthuman turn, objects are not simply inert backdrops for the ordering of social life but are actively involved in creating new sociopolitical orders. Infrastructure has emerged as a useful analytical tool to critique unequal power relations between people, economic systems, and the state, and to challenge conventional frameworks of urban-rural, North-South, and human-nonhuman. Moreover, thinking about infrastructure can add a much needed postcolonial and decolonial impetus to academic scholarship.\nAn assistant professor in the School of International Service at American University, Dr. Malini Ranganathan takes a critical look at questions of social and environmental justice through an intersectional and antiracist lens. Malini uses urban water infrastructure as a lens to study processes of neoliberal marketization, speculative urbanism, informality, and the (re)production of caste, class, and gendered othering in Bangalore, southern India. Her recent work has also focused on the issue of urban resilience and abolitionist climate justice in Washington, DC.\nOn March 15, 2019, I sat down with Malini on the occasion of her visit to the University of Wisconsin–Madison Geography Department to give the 2019 Treacy Lecture. We discuss decolonization as theory and practice, analytical frameworks for our current ecological crisis, her research in urban India and Washington, DC, and the potential for North-South collaborations and solidarity movements within academia and beyond.\nStream or download our conversation here. Interview highlights, edited for clarity, follow.\nPodcast: Play in new window | Download\nSubscribe: Stitcher | TuneIn | RSS\nThis transcript has been edited for length and clarity.\nSiddharth Menon: Your doctoral dissertation focused on the city of Bangalore, where you used water as a lens to study the modernization of the Indian economy since the 1990s, as well as speculative urbanism, informality, and systems of differentiation like caste and class dynamics. What makes water such a good lens to look at these kinds of metanarratives and structures? Why water, and why situate the research in Bangalore?\nMalini Ranganathan: Water is a resource that is indispensable to life. It thus becomes a resource to fight for and about which to ask very fundamental ethical questions. In a context in which poor informal groups, such as those living in slums or on the outskirts of major cities in India, had been historically shut out of state-provided water, the fact that market-oriented logics were introduced into the water sector, particularly from the early 2000s onwards, really brought forth and elicited grassroots responses, quite vehement responses, both in terms of resistance and negotiation. Because water raises such important ethical questions, it allows a window into citizen-state relations, especially in postcolonial polities where historically marginalized groups have been left out of state-provided networks.\nBangalore, in the state of Karnataka, had been a forerunner in market-oriented reforms. Karnataka’s political economy, especially because it had very reform-oriented chief ministers in the 2000s, was a preferred destination for international debtors. International lenders liked that it was reform-minded, the software powerhouse of India, and tech oriented. They liked the fact that Karnataka had shown an interest in World Bank relationships and borrowing from the World Bank. And, so, in the early 2000s, a slew of international organizations, international financial institutions, the World Bank, the US Agency for International Development, the Asian Development Bank, and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, all descended on Bangalore to create out of it the best practice for urban governance reforms and market-oriented logics.\nWater allows a window into citizen-state relations.\nThese organizations used the water sector as exemplary of infrastructure that needed reform, because it was said to be overrun by corrupt bureaucrats and an inefficient public sector, and it had a lot of “leakage,” which is the technocratic term for water being consumed illegally or by informal groups like slum dwellers. So, you had this technical language of market rationality and efficiency infusing the water sector. That was very interesting to me, as someone interested in environmental issues, but also the politics of market-oriented reforms and the role of development organizations. Even in my prior work on rural development, I had seen the impact that international development loans had on countries throughout the Global South, but especially in India. Bangalore also has a thriving civil society—various citizen and civic movements engaging with these reforms and the government—and I thought it would be a great place to ask the empirical questions that I was interested in asking.\nSM: From that early work focusing on the Global South, and particularly India, your more recent work has shifted to looking at—and I know these frameworks are problematic—the Global North. Your recent article with Eve Bratman focuses on shifting our framework from urban resilience to abolitionist climate justice, and looking at Washington, DC, as a case study for that. What’s at stake with that shift? And why the shift to working in a Global North context like DC?\nMR: This an interesting question for all of us to try to grapple with. What does it mean when folks are trying to work across the so-called South-North divide? What are the openings provided by that? What are some of the challenges? For me, I am a professor based in Washington, DC, at the School of International Service, that trains students to do foreign policy, international development, peace and conflict resolution, and to think about these global questions. And it was of concern to me that students were very comfortable thinking about “underdevelopment” or “poverty” or “disenfranchisement” elsewhere around the world, but when it came to thinking about those questions in their own backyard—when it came to histories of racial segregation in the United States, processes of dispossessing minorities, and the US state and its implications in global empire— they were much less comfortable talking about those questions. So, it became a pedagogical challenge, and necessity, to really bring in the US not as an exceptional case of liberty and democracy and equality, but as another case to study in terms of vexing questions of inequality and development.\nDC is a paradigmatic city of racial and environmental inequality. If you look at a map of DC, some people have referred to it as an apartheid city because there’s literally a line separating the city by race and by class. You have in the northeast and southeast parts of DC populations that are over 90 percent African American, where the poverty rate is much, much higher than in the rest of the city, where basic amenities and infrastructures are deteriorating and sorely lacking, where there are multifold challenges in terms of health, environment, and social equity outcomes.\nI was interested in looking more deeply at the production of those inequalities, what led to this stark apartheid geography, and then specifically looking at what this has meant in terms of environmental outcomes. And it so happened that at the time I started thinking about this, the District of Columbia government started publishing a series of climate resilience plans, thinking about, in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy and Hurricane Katrina, how are we going to make American cities more resilient, more able to cope with future extreme weather events wrought by climate change? These plans selectively put the lens on particular vulnerabilities while also neglecting longstanding inequalities wrought by racial capitalism, racial segregation, and environmental racism.\nI wanted to challenge and critique these frameworks of resilience. One of the ways that Eve Bratman and I found was, what does the vocabulary of climate justice bring into the fold that resilience has neglected? We asked two questions: what are current conditions of climate change vulnerability and precarity in some of these neighborhoods in DC that are supposedly prone to extreme weather events or climate vulnerability? And, second, how are residents currently combating and coping with these vulnerabilities and precarities?\nAnd one of the things we argue is that mainstream resilience thinking—this kind of top-down expert-driven resilience thinking— is focused on technical solutions and future-gazing, in the sense that it’s focusing on how we “climate proof” DC, especially these vulnerable neighborhoods, from future extreme weather. It’s not focused on some of the historical causes of harm. So, we sought to do a historical analysis, and this is key for building theory and for a deepening a sense of how to actually achieve justice.\nSM: Exactly on that point, like you rightly mentioned, there are places like the Global South in the Global North and places like the North in the South. So, in terms of doing research in both these analytical categories, what are the potential opportunities and the challenges of theoretically drawing from both of these contexts and also in terms of building solidarity movements between disenfranchised, disempowered, oppressed, marginalized people across both contexts?\nMR: Thank you for that question. I think there’s more and more interest, particularly among younger scholars, for breaking down these long-held ontological and epistemological boundaries and categories, as you call them, between North and South. And you see a trend in the academy of folks doing this. I feel like I’m also part of this trend, and in many ways have learned from and benefited from the early scholars who have done this, and I’m also helping to chart a path for others to do it as well.\nSpeaking very concretely about the DC case, my colleague Eve Bratman wrote an article in Third World Quarterly, “Development’s Paradox: is Washington DC a Third World city?” in which she outlined really startling indicators in especially northeast and southeast DC on, for instance, things like the prevalence of HIV/AIDS and how much higher it was in these areas than other parts of DC; in fact, they were approximating Haiti and other places that we normally associate with the Global South.\nI want to challenge and critique these frameworks of resilience. What does the vocabulary of climate justice bring into the fold that resilience has neglected?\nIn my own work on water, I found that there are geographies within the US that are often out of sight out of mind that have conditions of peripheral urbanization with inadequate access to water and sanitation. They still rely on privies for sanitation. You see that in the US deep South, on the US-Mexico border, in California’s Central Valley. So, empirically, the realities are there. And then the question analytically is, well, then what do we learn from social science research on the Global South that can help us better understand these geographies in the US? And then, conversely, what can we learn about the production of elite spaces in the Global North that is helpful in terms of global capital and understanding the production of elite spaces in the Global South? I think that theory building for understanding global geographies is a compelling way to do things. It’s exciting and it’s also difficult.\nFeatured image: Water infrastructure in Washington, DC.

This symbol was introduced to provide a more readily understandable symbol for citizens and consumers in France to ensure recyclable products are separated at end of life. In other words, if the product displays the Triman logo, the product should be recycled appropriately.\nThere are many Producer Compliance Schemes (PCSs) and collection organisations in France for different waste streams and over time they have developed their own communication methods, including different marking systems to inform consumers and guide waste sorting. In an effort to reduce any confusion, the Triman logo was introduced to specify separate collection possibilities to consumers, whilst also highlighting the recycling efforts of product vendors.\nlocal packaging legislation. More information about the Green Dot, why it’s not mandatory anymore and the impacts of this change can be found here.This Triman logo is not to be confused with the Green Dot logo (pictured left), which demonstrates compliance with\nWhat are the Triman requirements?\nThe mandatory marking is required on all recyclable products under the Extended Producer Responsibility (ERP) umbrella which are placed on the French market. This includes the following products:\n- Furniture and furnishings\n- Graphic papers\n- Clothing textiles\n- Household linens\n- Household packaging\n- Electrical and electronic equipment\n- Batteries and accumulators\n- Products that generate specific non-point waste\nHousehold glass packaging and products for professional use are excluded, as well as products that exhibit the crossed-out wheeled bin symbol. As it may not always be feasible for all relevant products to display the Triman logo, the marking must instead be displayed on the packaging, use instructions, the product website or any other medium that accompanied the product.\nA useful handbook which contains this information, including the graphic appearance requirements, is available in English for all UK producers distance selling into France.\nComplications despite good intentions\nThere are some complications with the existence of the Triman logo, despite its good intentions.\nThe Triman logo was brought in to harmonise the communication between consumers and the different collection systems, but this has not been harmonised on a European level. The Triman logo hasn’t been enforced in any other European country which means the compatibility with global trade is questionable. In a statement from 2013, before the Triman was introduced, the Industry Association wrote that they “strongly believe that the Triman measure fragments the internal market, is a barrier to trade, is more strict than necessary and is not proportionate to meet the objective being pursued”.\nA report was published in April 2005 by the Federal Union of Consumers (UFC) titled Que Choisir which investigated the effectiveness of the Triman Logo four months after implementation. Their research showed that out of the obligated products tested only 20% were Triman compliant. With online shopping continuously increasing in popularity, the UFC suggested that the websites selling these products may have been displaying the Triman logo online instead, as this is in accordance with the Decree (no. 2014-1577).\nUnfortunately during another survey it was revealed that 64% of products, including those from large international companies, were failing to display the symbol anywhere. The survey also showed that 81% of producers use multiple logos and that the Triman logo was often incorrectly used on items that were made up of multiple material types, leading to consumer confusion.\nUniversal Recycling Symbol.One of the many symbols that are likely to be seen on obligated items is the Universal Recycling Symbol (seen left) that is, along with its variants, recognised all over the world. The symbol holds a very similar meaning to the Triman logo – the object this symbol is placed on is capable of being recycled – so it’s not clear why the Triman logo is also required as it is effectively duplicating the\nAbove all, the Triman is expensive for obligated producers to implement - having to change the design of products and packaging to meet the requirements of only one national market - and is potentially contradicting its aim of simplifying waste sorting activities. There is also a lack of enforcement on record for any non-compliance, so now that the Green Dot is voluntary, maybe the Triman’s mandatory status could also be reviewed?\nHow can Ecosurety help?\nWe can offer consultancy to help understand your requirements in Europe, with support solutions including impact assessments, compliance strategies, regulatory monitoring, data management and distributor compliance support.\nPlease contact our team of specialists if you are offering goods for sale in France or other European countries by emailing firstname.lastname@example.org or calling 0333 4330 370.\nYou will be affected by batteries Extended Producer Responsibility changes if you are a producer or distributor of batteries in the UK.

Between Japanese toad lilies and hydrangea paniculata, which one performs better in shaded conditions?","answer":"Japanese toad lilies are better suited for shaded conditions. They are woodland plants that grow well in shady areas and look lovely when planted with other shade-loving plants like hostas. In contrast, hydrangea paniculata performs best with maximum light exposure, especially in spring, though it can tolerate some afternoon shade in summer.","context":["Looking for fall blooming flowers?

Because they are easy to maintain experienced gardeners and newcomers alike can add hydrangeas to their gardens. Of course there are many varieties of hydrangeas with a great deal of flexibility in terms of their flowers. The hydrangea paniculata, or panicle hydrangea, is a unique specimen for its beautiful panicle like blooms. Caring for them is easiest done by following this simple guide:\nHydrangea paniculata prefer pH levels between 5.8 and 6.2. It is recommended that you use moderate to high fertilization for this particular variety. The soil pH level will not influence the color of the flowers but you do need to make sure you have proper soil pH level so that you can avoid any type of iron deficiency in the foliage.\nIf you are going to grow your plants in pots and you want to move them at any point into their first set of pots or you want to move them from your garden into pots for the winter you can do so once they reach an appropriate size. If you want to move them to protect them from the open environment to make sure that you protect the stems and the roots while transferring them and be sure to move the plants into an area with good air circulation.\nThis particular hydrangea requires moderate to moist watering. You want to water the plants thoroughly without oversaturating them. It’s important to keep the soil consistently moist but never wet it too much for the duration of the growth cycle.\nThe hydrangea paniculata performs best when it is planted in porous, well-drained soil. If you are growing this type of shrub it’s recommended that you add compost to your soil mixture to help it with that water retention. You can also add pine bark to increase the weight and the stability of your mixture as it will help prevent the soil from compressing over time which will increase the longevity of your shrub. If you need to alter the pH level of the soil you can always add different nutrition in the form of fertilizer to your planting medium.\nDuring the beginning of Spring, this plant should be given as much light as possible throughout the day. It’s important that you properly space out your hydrangea paniculata such that they do not cover one another and prevent one another from acquiring the necessary sunlight. If you plant them too close together and they are not properly spaced, the plants will naturally try to stretch out and you’ll have to prune them more often. This is particularly problematic if you are trying to cultivate the plant as a form of natural wall or shrub.\nDuring the summer heat, it may be beneficial to provide a bit of light shading, especially in the afternoons. If you live in an area that has very hot summers be cognizant of this and make sure to plant in an area where your hydrangea will get afternoon shade. Morning sunlight is typically perfectly acceptable and in fact, encouraged for this type of shrub but in the afternoon too much direct sunlight can burn the plant.\nTrimming and pruning\nIf you want to create a more tightly bound plant appearance you can always prune and trim appropriately. It is best to prune the hydrangea in the summer and fall after the leaves have sprouted. If you notice that there are dead or otherwise sickly branches you can prune those off immediately so that they don’t continue to derive nutrients from the plant. With regard to the blooms, you can deadhead at any time. Deadheading is a process where you simply clip away the old blooms once they have reached maturity. This is something that helps to keep the appearance of the plant attractive while simultaneously helps to redistribute energy to forming new flowers throughout the season.\nIt is important that when you are growing these hydrangeas you provide for proper spacing and adequate air flow. It is always best to grow them in an open environment. you can help to control the height and the strength of the stems by leaving adequate space and when you do go to prune the plant annually, make sure you remove any branches that might be rubbing across one another so that you can help strengthen the overall plant and prevent them from damaging one another.\nPests and diseases\nWhen you are a growing hydrangea paniculata, aphids and spider mites are the most prevalent of insects you will see. You should keep your eyes peeled for these pests in April and May and be sure to spray preventatively during those two months to prevent an outbreak in June or July. The middle of summer is when spider mites grow actively so it is best to take preventative measures. The problem with pests like aphids is that once they are on your plant or shrub you have to be sure you destroy every single one throughout the entire plant otherwise they will come back in full force.\nFun fact: Hydrangea paniculata is the only form of hydrangea that you can prune into the shape of a tree."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:fa26745f-fa86-4e5e-83ae-16cb85e42600>","<urn:uuid:6dc429c3-9ed9-4669-8ab2-d2f6d9342456>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Is a home inspection report shared with others as freely as the HUD-1 Settlement Statement?","answer":"No. The home inspection report is controlled by the client and is only shared with others (like real estate agents) with the client's permission. In contrast, the HUD-1 Settlement Statement is automatically provided to all parties involved in the closing process as it outlines all actual charges imposed on both the Buyer and Seller.","context":["A home inspector has specialized training and experience to identify safety and functional problems in the home system. The home inspector observes and checks over 500 items in a home system that the average homeowner does not usually consider. See \"what a home inspector inspects\" to get a small sample of why a home inspector may be a good choice.\nHome inspectors are required to inspect certain components and systems of the home if they follow the standards of practice under the ASHI or InterNACHI guidelines. Go to www.ashi.com or www.nachi.org to view these standards of practice. Most qualified home inspectors will go beyond the minimum requirements and we certainly do too. If there is a system in the home that you are particularly concerned about then we will thoroughly check what is important to you. It should be noted that home inspectors cannot see through walls, move furnishings in the home, see leaks that are not leaking so there are limitations of the service. See \"What is inspected\" tab\nTypically a home inspection will take between 2 to 4 hours. The length of time depends on the size, age, components, and complexities of the home.\nWhile it is not necessary or mandatory to have the home buyer or real estate agent present during the inspection it is a good idea. While at the inspection, the home buyer can have another look at the home and this will provide an opportunity for the home inspector to communicate more effectively some of the concerns, if there are any, about the home. We love to educate our clients on the components of their home.\nSure you can. You should probably inspect it several times before the purchase and you should inspect it with a home inspector. Buying a home is a subjective emotional experience and the inspector is there to be objective and find problems that you will want to negotiate in the final sell of the home. Many times the seller will either fix the problem, offer a lower price on the sale, give cash at settlement for you to spend on fixing it, or maybe do nothing. However, you will not be surprised when you unpack your belongings and find out that your water heater does not work. A home inspector knows what to look for - in fact, if added up there are several hundred items that an inspector will look at that the average homeowner will not inspect. We want you to pay attention to what color you want to paint the living room, while we pay attention to whether or not the toilet is leaking.\nA home inspector not only inspects homes during real estate transactions, but a home should be inspected yearly or at least at the 11th month before the home warranty becomes void. Let us know if you would like us to inspect your home again at the 11th month for a deep discount rate.\nWe also offer a home inspection consultation service for sellers. This consultation will help the seller know what to fix and repair so that the real estate transaction will go more smoothly without surprises.\nNo. The home inspector is not a code inspector and will not enforce any changes to be made to the client. It is up to the client to make the recommended changes.\nYou will receive a verbal preliminary report upon completion of the home inspection. An emailed report will be delivered in less than 24 hours. While some inspectors print the report on-site or email the results before leaving the property, we prefer to take some time to review and make sure the report meets our high standards before providing the final report.\nThe home inspection report will provide prioritized items that need to be repaired, be monitored, or is a safety issue. See the \"Report\" link to see an example.\nWe offer several other services such as wood destroying organisms (termite) inspections, infrared scanning to identify thermal/moisture intrusion and home maintenance tips.\nWe also offer Home Binder and ReCall Chek services - See links to these services.\nJust like any other small business, there are costs associated with providing excellent service and products. Education, specialized tools, marking materials, wages, taxes, general liability insurance, errors and omissions insurance, specialized training, experience, vehicle cost, computer software programs, and maintenance items add up. There is also the risk of working in unsafe conditions such as walking on the roof, being exposed to electrical and airborne hazards, and confined work areas like crawl spaces. After the inspection, we believe you will agree that the benefits will outweigh the cost for you.\nWe know that families are on a budget just like our family. We want to make it as affordable as possible and at the same time give you the best service. Our rates are highly competitive. Give us a chance to find out.\nEvery home is unique and therefore requires special attention. The size, age, components, and other factors play into the time it will take to perform the inspection. While this is very annoying for cost comparison shoppers (I am one of them), you will find in the end that we are very competitive, if not let us know. However, if you must know, the fee is usually between $250 - $600 with an average fee of $375. However, we also offer a 10% discount to military, veterans, teachers, first responders, and community volunteers.\nYou control the report. No one else will have it unless you give it to them. Most people will give it to their real estate agent to help look over the items and make recommendations. With your permission, we can provide a copy to your real estate agent if you would like.\nWe are glad you asked. We try to develop a clear report with pictures, illustrations, and explanations of major concerns, minor concerns, and safety issues. An example report is located under the \"report example\" tab.\nAmerican Society of Home Inspectors (ASHI) and the International Association of Certified Home Inspectors (InterNACHI) are the professional organizations for home inspectors. Since home inspectors are not regulated in Kansas or Missouri and many other states, these professional organizations help regulate the industry. To become a member of these organizations the home inspector agrees to abide by certain ethical standards and to be adequately trained. If you do not choose us to be your preferred home inspectors, you owe it to yourself to at least find someone that is a member of one of these organizations. We happen to belong to both.\nYour construction friend should look at your home and we hope that he or she does. However, most construction workers work in a trade where they specialize in a particular construction field and they do not generalize to other areas. A home inspector has training as a generalist in understanding all of the different components of the home and how they interact with each other. A checklist of inspection items and knowledge of minor and major problems are known by the home inspectors and may not be fully known by other specialists.\nAn FHA appraiser determines if a home is suitable to carry a loan and if it meets the basic requirements for habitable living. A home inspection is much more thorough and is required to review more components and systems of the home. This is why many FHA appraisers will also suggest that the client have their home inspected by a home inspector.\nWe offer discounts for Veterans, military personnel, teachers, community volunteers and much more. Tell us what you do for your community and we may offer a discount for your service.\nLook at the customer benefits page! We think you will agree that very few home inspectors offer this wide range of benefits. If you find something that another home inspection business offers that we don't let us know. We want to be competitive and to give you what you want.","Typical Closing Costs for Buyers\nThere are a lot of fees that will be assessed before and during a closing. These fees could be paid by either the Buyer or Seller, depending on prior negotiations or state law requirements, but typically most of it is paid by the Buyer.\nAll closing costs are outlined in a HUD-1 Settlement Statement that shows all actual charges imposed on the Buyer and Seller, which is provided to the parties prior to closing.\nFollowing is a representation of most of the fees charged in connection with purchasing property, but it is not a meant to be considered a comprehensive list.\n- Lender Fees/Mortgage Fees and Points – this amount can vary with each lender. Typical charges include application fees, credit report fees, and origination fees. There are no fees in cash transactions.\n- Title Insurance Fees – various components of title insurance these fees include the Owner’s policy, the Lender’s policy, lien search, title exam, and closing endorsements. Owner’s policy fee is based on the amount of the purchase price – there is a fee of $575.00 up to the first $100,000 and thereafter a fee of $5.00 for every $1,000 over the first $100,000. So, if you purchase a home for $120,000 the Owner’s policy will cost $675. Lender’s policy fee can be anywhere from $100 to $200 (not needed on cash transactions). Other fees mentioned above should not exceed $500.\n- Recording Fees (Deed and Mortgage) – it is $10 to record the first page and $8.50 for each additional page.\n- Documentary Stamps and Fees – on all deeds and other instruments relating to real property or an interest in real property, a fee of .70₵ is chargedfor each $100 of value paid, also known as consideration; on all mortgages, a fee of 35₵ is charged for each $100 of the mortgage amount; and there is an intangible tax charged in the amount of 20₵ for each $100 of consideration.\n- Brokerage Fee – $200 on properties $100,000 or less, and $295 on properties over $100,000.\n- Survey – typical cost of a survey on residential property should not exceed $500.\n- Home Inspection, Wind Mitigation and Four Point Inspection – the charge for a home inspection on a single family residence is often based on the square footage of the home. For a home that is 1,500 square feet or less, the cost is approximately $350 to $400. However, you must add to that the cost of a wind mitigation report and a four point inspection report, both of which will be required by homeowner’s insurance – the cost of each report is between $75 and $100 each.\n- Pest Inspection Report – typical cost is $50\n- Appraisal Fee – always required when a mortgage is needed, and can cost anywhere from $300 to $500.\n- Homeowner’s Insurance – must pay 1 year’s premium up front on or before closing whether or not you have a mortgage. If you have a mortgage, in addition to the pre-payment, an amount equal to 1/12 of the annual premium will be calculated for a lender required escrow account, and a portion may be included in the closing costs. Cost of homeowner’s insurance varies depending on the location of the property (is it in a high risk flood zone?), the construction of the property (premiums on masonry block homes is typically less than premiums on wood frame homes), the age of the roof, the age of the windows, etc.\n- Property Taxes – if you acquire a mortgage, a portion of the property taxes will be collected at closing to be placed in your lender required escrow account."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e56b397e-8f01-425c-b55d-15e3850c3660>","<urn:uuid:9f32ec87-6536-4156-96c6-a09a8c0f9947>"],"error":null}

When it comes to adopting new safety technology, quite a bit.\nFollowing the death of racing legend Dale Earnhardt in 2001, NASCAR took a serious look at the safety of the sport. The racing group took a broad approach to better protecting occupants in the event of an accident by properly restraining the driver, using energy-absorbing materials, and creating survivable volume inside the car. As a result, drivers now regularly walk away from crashes at very high speeds and conduct television interviews immediately afterward.\nThe general aviation industry has been doing its own research and paying attention to what the auto racing industry is doing. Unfortunately, the current regulatory structure governing the design of most general aviation airplanes doesn’t easily allow similar innovative, safety-enhancing products and technologies to come to market.\nThat may be about to change, however.\nIn March, the FAA issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to update the regulations governing small airplanes, and gave the public 60 days to comment. The General Aviation Manufacturers Association (GAMA) believes this proposal — which we support overall — is an important step forward to improve general aviation safety and revive the light end of the airplane market. Let me explain.\nOur industry is rapidly changing — but the rules governing certification of small airplanes were put into place decades ago and simply haven’t kept pace with technology. The existing regulations also aren’t flexible enough to support the innovative ideas manufacturers are developing today and will create in years to come.\nRecognizing this challenge, in 2011 the FAA chartered the Part 23 Reorganization Aviation Rulemaking Committee (ARC), which GAMA’s Greg Bowles co-chaired.\nOver 18 months, 150 government and industry experts from around the world carefully assessed how the outdated requirements affected both the initial certification and modification processes for small airplanes.\nThey then suggested setting performance-based design requirements rather than prescriptive, technology-dependent rules that rely on assumptions, such as weight and propulsion type.\nThese recommendations would streamline the regulatory process — lowering the costs of certifying a new product — and give manufacturers needed flexibility by allowing them to comply with the rules through consensus-based standards.\nIn short, the ARC’s goal was to double safety benefits at half the certification costs to government and industry.\nThe ARC’s work was greeted favorably by leaders in Washington, D.C.\nIn May 2013, U.S. Representative Mike Pompeo (R-Kansas) and U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) introduced the Small Airplane Revitalization Act (SARA) to set a date — Dec. 15, 2015 — to implement its recommendations. By November 2013, both chambers passed the bill unanimously — an almost unheard-of time period for a substantial piece of legislation. The day before Thanksgiving, President Obama signed SARA into law.\nFast forward more than two years, and — with continued interest from Congress and the aviation community — the FAA could announce the final rule by the end of this year.\nGeneral aviation manufacturers are on the cusp of seeing real change that will allow our industry to better deploy new technologies and facilitate future innovations, increasing safety in the skies and creating new opportunities for those who design and build aircraft, just as NASCAR has done with cars.\nIf these new products excite more people about flying, manufacturers would also likely be able to add jobs, stimulating the U.S. economy.\nOne example is electric and hybrid propulsion aircraft. In February, GAMA welcomed our very first associate members, eight companies that are developing this cutting-edge technology. Although the current regulations do not support electric propulsion, these manufacturers will be able to get their aircraft certified under the new rules.\nThe same current regulations that govern new production also restrict modifications to existing aircraft. GAMA is equally excited that the reform of Part 23 will enable innovative alterations that add safety and utility in a cost-effective and efficient manner.\nThe new rules will allow FAA to be nimble enough to respond to technologies as they become available, and customers will have access to the latest products with enhanced safety at a lower cost. It’s a win-win-win for industry, government, and consumers.\nThe rules won’t just affect manufacturers in the United States, either. SARA specifically sought to ensure global harmonization so that manufacturers don’t have to design different products for different countries.\nGAMA has also been working actively in Europe as leaders there reorganize their rules for small aircraft. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) issued an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking in 2015, with the final CS-23 rule expected later this year. Regulatory agencies in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, and New Zealand are also participating in this initiative.\nGiven how quickly the aviation industry is changing, it’s time for new and flexible rules that govern how small airplanes are certified. The implementation of the ARC’s recommendations and those developed by EASA promise to foster a new spirit of innovation for general aviation manufacturers, a more efficient and effective certification process for regulators and industry, and greater safety at a lower cost for the public.\nWhat a bright future general aviation has ahead of it."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:93bb27e8-dfd7-4ab7-8b7f-b445c875d418>","<urn:uuid:063730b2-811b-472a-bcca-ef5f613aa8b5>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Need tips for protecting jewelry during stone setting - what's recommended?","answer":"To protect jewelry during stone setting, masking tape is an effective solution. You can cover the area around where you'll be working to prevent scratches on your newly finished piece while setting the stone. Additionally, if you need to do more cleaning around a setting where a stone is already in place, you can cover the set stone with masking tape for protection. Masking tape can also be used to create 'handles' for holding small or slippery stones, making it easier to put stones in settings and check whether they fit or are level. If a stone gets stuck in a tight setting, masking tape can often be used to pull it out.","context":["In life, as in jewellery making, there are things that you can’t always learn from books or from taking a class; practical things like how to remove a broken drill bit stuck in a piece of metal, shortcuts to help you work more efficiently, time-saving tips, and tricks of the trade. These are things you learn from other people; people who have a lot of experience in the trade, people in the trenches. Of course, you could also find out these things eventually through trial and error – well, error, mostly.\nSomething I wish I could ask all the goldsmiths out there is: What are your favorite tools or pieces of equipment and why? There is a lot to be learned that way, and not just in relationship to their work, but about new and better ways of using these tools as well.\nThis is the first of a series of posts where I’ll be sharing my favourite tools and tips with you, and I look forward to hearing from all of you as well. What are your favourite tools, and what “life-saving” tips do you know that you could share?\nHigh on my list of the must-have tools in the studio is masking tape. I have several rolls in different parts of my studio placed in strategic places. There is a roll on my bench, always within easy reach. Masking tape has gotten me out of several tricky “sticky” situations and has saved me a lot of time and frustration.\nSomething masking tape is good for, of course, is … masking.\nIn preparation for etching, cover the parts of your design that you want to “keep”; masking tape acts as “resist” and protects the metal from being eaten away by the chemicals. This works well when etching copper or brass with ferric chloride.\nOn the finished piece, the areas that were covered with masking tape are smooth and slightly raised; all the recessed areas of the design have been etched. They show a beautiful texture, especially around the edges of the masked parts.\nPieces of tape can be torn by hand or specific shapes can be cut out with scissors. You can see here how this produces different results. With torn pieces of tape, there is a more pronounced texture (“pull lines”) around the edges, whereas with the cut pieces, the etch is cleaner and sharper around the shapes.\nThe same masking technique can be used for sandblasting as well. After finishing and polishing your piece, cover the parts of your design that need to remain smooth and polished. Whatever is left exposed will have a lightly textured and matte surface after sandblasting. For heavy sandblasting, duct tape or electrical tape might be more suitable, but I find that masking tape is sufficient for standard results.\nIt’s great for covering or protecting various surfaces.\nSince rivets are put in and set after a piece has been finished and polished, it helps to protect the area around the rivets to prevent damaging the surface of the metal when tapping them in with the riveting hammer.\nNo matter how careful you are when setting a stone, accidents happen! To be safe and to protect your newly finished piece from scratches, cover with masking tape.\nCover a stone that’s already set, if you need to do some more cleaning around the setting.\nYou can use it to tape together a stack of sheets of metal.\nThis is useful when you need to drill through several sheets and make sure all the holes are perfectly lined up (for riveting for example).\nMasking tape is quite sticky and can be used to make “handles”.\nUse them to hold things that are very small, difficult to hold or slippery (like stones). With a “handle” it’s easier to put a stone in a setting, and take it out, to check whether it fits or it is level.\nTo drill pearls. A pearl drilling vise is not really practical, because the pearl tends to slip out and worse, the tool can damage the delicate surface of the pearl.\nLife-saver. A piece of masking tape can be used to pull a stone out of a tight setting (works most of the time – more tips later on what to do when the stone is really stuck).\nSome people prefer duct tape. Yes, it is tougher and stickier, but I find that it tends to leave behind too much of a sticky residue once removed. Other people swear by green tape or painter’s tape. I find it not quite sticky enough and sometimes too flimsy.\nTo each her own.\nOh, and one more thing!\nWhen a bandage is not available, guess what I reach for?\nNote: The idea for this blog post comes from Secret Shop Weapons, a book recently published by MJSA Press."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3f3355ba-894e-40c0-8779-b0bee5d99a2d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can you compare the medical screening process needed for kids with autism sleep problems vs regular snoring - what do doctors check in each case?","answer":"For children with autism, medical screening includes checking for tonsillitis, adenoids, gastrointestinal disturbance, seizures, sleep disorders like sleep apnea and restless leg syndrome, and food/environmental allergies. They also evaluate environmental factors like room temperature and sensory sensitivities. For children with regular snoring, doctors screen to determine if it's caused by temporary conditions like respiratory infections, or structural issues like small jaw/airway or enlarged tonsils and adenoids. All children should be screened for snoring to check if it's associated with sleep apnea, as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics.","context":["Conquering the Bedtime Blues\nMost parents have had some experience with a child that has trouble falling asleep.\nMost parents have had some experience with a child that has trouble falling asleep. Temporary sleep difficulties are an expected phase in child development. However, ongoing and persistent sleep disturbances can have an adverse effect on the child, parents, and other household members (Wheeler, 2019). Children with autism spectrum disorder tend to experience these sleep disturbances more than a typically developing child. Developing positive bedtime routines and sleep hygiene can be beneficial in eliminating said sleep disturbances. Children on the autism spectrum thrive on routine and consistency, the ability to predict what will happen in their day to day life. This is why developing a positive bedtime routine for a child on the autism spectrum is so vital. First, it is important to start by establishing positive sleep patterns for young children with autism. To do this there are a few areas to be assessed to determine the proper sleep pattern for your child (Devnani, Hedge 2015):\nAssessment of any underlying medical problems.\nHave your child assessed for tonsillitis, adenoids, gastrointestinal disturbance, or seizure by your family doctor.\n• Evaluate current bedtime routine. Is the room too hot or too cold, are there any tactile sensitivities affecting your child, are there loud noises or visual stimuli affecting your child at bedtime?\n• Screen for intrinsic sleep disorders. Have your child assessed for sleep apnea or restless leg syndrome. This can be done through a sleep clinic referred by your family doctor.\n• Assessment for food or environmental allergies. Have your family doctor screen your child for any allergies your child may have.\nOnce these areas have been assessed it is important to establish a positive bedtime routine with the above findings in mind.\nTips for establishing a positive bedtime routine (Devnani, Hedge 2015):\n- Establish sensory cues. Try adding calming music, and relaxing aromatherapy such as lavender, bergamot and chamomile to your child’s bedtime routine. The use of eye pillows can help to shut out excess light and relax the eyes. A quick back or facial massage and weighted blanket can help release serotonin in the body due to the deep touch pressure (Ames, 2017).\n- Establish communication cues. Look at the same story every night, establish a sleep story, use a visual prompt or visual sequence, and make use of a reward chart or visual cue cards. The Rabbit Who Wants to Fall Asleep is a story designed to help your child calm down and prepare for sleep. https://www.cbsnews.com/news/book-uses-psychological-tricks-to-get-kids-to-sleep-faster/ Other sleep stories/calming strategies can be found at https://www.calm.com/sleep\n- Make a visual bedtime schedule. Have your child help pick out pictures and order of bedtime routine. The following link is an example of a visual schedule for a bedtime routine. http://www.mymountainwild.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Bedtimeroutine.pdf\n- Pick a specific bedtime. Pick a bedtime that is reasonable for your child, and which you can consistently provide.\n- Provide reminders and consistency for the whole family. A good bedtime routine should be the same everyday and include activities that are relaxing to your child.\nA good bedtime routine will help teach a child to calm down, relax, and get ready to sleep therefore providing them with all the essential tools towards getting more efficient rest. The addition of a bedtime routine can also help when travelling. If you can maintain this routine when going away for a few nights the child may be able to rest better knowing they will still have the consistency of their bedtime routine to rely on (Wheeler, 2019).\nBy Kayla Soosaar, February 2019\nAmes, C.

Maybe we have a partner who snores, or a grandpa who falls asleep in his easy chair and snores so loud it's hard to carry on a conversation in the room. We think of it as a common condition, and while it might be irritating trying to sleep beside a snorer, it usually isn't anything to worry about.\nBut is snoring normal for young kids?\nAccording to the National Sleep Foundation, most children snore once in a while, but only 10 percent snore on a regular basis, compared to 30 to 40 percent of adults. Snoring is caused by a lack of air moving freely through your nose and mouth during sleep. In adults, it often happens when the airway narrows because of an awkward sleeping position or because of abnormalities in the soft tissue of the throat. It's less common in kids, so if a child is snoring, there's sometimes another reason for it.\nSnoring in kids can be caused by:\nA cold or some other respiratory infection\nA small jaw or a small airway\nEnlarged tonsils and adenoids\nSome of these are minor conditions that will pass soon enough, but consistent snoring could point to a more serious issue like sleep apnea.\nWhat is sleep apnea?\nAbout 3 percent of all children between the ages of 1 through 9 have sleep apnea or upper airway resistance syndrome, which can be a more serious issue. So much so that in 2002, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that all children be screened for snoring to see if it's associated with sleep apnea.\nApproximately 1 to 3 percent of children suffer from breathing problems while they sleep. When snoring is accompanied by gasps or pauses in breathing, the child may have sleep apnea. This occurs when kids' muscles, which are usually relaxed during sleep, become so relaxed that the airway becomes obstructed and the child can't breathe properly, creating a pause that can last anywhere from a few seconds to a full minute. The brain then alerts the body that it's not breathing properly and the child will usually gasp or snort and start to breathe again.\nThis can be exhausting for a child's body, and because of all the waking in the night it can seriously affect quality of sleep and make for cranky kids who have trouble focusing. The American College of Chest Physicians claims that children who snore loudly are twice as likely to have learning problems. It only makes sense; tired kids are way more likely to have trouble concentrating and tend to be overtired and hyperactive.\nThere are treatments for sleep apnea that can solve the problem. Often, simply removing the child's tonsils or adenoids may take care of the issue. Some kids might need to use a machine that will blow air into their nose via a nose mask to keep the airway open and unobstructed.\nHaving a child who snores regularly isn't necessarily cause for alarm, but make sure you take your child in to your family physician to rule out any underlying conditions that might be affecting sleep quality. This will help ensure a lifetime of sweet (and quiet) dreams."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e45bd9be-48a1-415e-93a0-603a155bb28a>","<urn:uuid:2daa7126-f44d-470e-8041-f3f8e30dbe45>"],"error":null}

In contrast, Brantley Gilbert had two number one hits that went gold - 'Country Must Be Country Wide' and 'You Don't Know Her Like I Do'.","context":["From cowboys to hillbillies, in\nand big cities …\nThere’s no doubt military fans of country rocker Brantley Gilbert are worldwide after his first USO tour.\nThis spring, Gilbert embarked on an eight-day tour to entertain troops in Italy and Kuwait.\nEleven-time USO tour veteran Toby Keith tried to prepare Gilbert for what to expect.\n“We already knew about [the USO tour] when I was out touring with Toby, so we would talk and he would give me some pointers and get me all excited about what to expect,” Gilbert said. “He told me it was gonna be a life-changing experience, but I wasn’t prepared for all of that, like hearing all the stories and meeting these people who protect our freedom every day.”\nHe and the band had wanted to go overseas to bring the troops a little piece of home for a long time, Gilbert said.\n“They were so appreciative of us being there that we came back feeling like we were the lucky ones,” he said. “We felt lucky just to get the chance to do it.”\nWith two cousins serving and other family members who have served, Gilbert is no stranger to the sacrifice of service. Nor is he unfamiliar with being apart from family.\n“I’m engaged now and even when I spend a month or two apart from her it seems like forever. It’s a huge deal and feels like an eternity,” he said. “These guys and gals spend nine months to a year away from their families and that just … blows me away. It’s a huge sacrifice, putting your neck out there like that and being willing to go somewhere you’re not familiar with to do a job. That is definitely something to be respected.”\nHis unique blend of country and hard rock has become a favorite among younger troops—particularly those from the South—who have presented him with their dog tags as thanks for the music that helped get them through their deployments. He often wears them as a tribute to his fans, and the dog tags have now become something of a trademark.\n“I had two twins come up to me—two Marines—and they handed me their dog tags. Told me they knew I always wear one on my chain,” Gilbert said. “They had just got back from Afghanistan and they drove so many hours to come see me just to hand these tags to me and tell me it was my music that helped them get through their deployment.\n“Stuff like that makes you speechless. It’s an awesome thing, and I make sure to rotate [the tags] out every night.”\nAs part of his USO tour, Gilbert visited troops at Italy’s Aviano Air Base before moving on to Kuwait, where stops included Camps Buehring and Arifjan.\n“It was a little more real there for us [in Kuwait],” he said. “We were proud to be in Italy and proud to bring our music to the troops stationed there, but playing in Kuwait really felt a little closer to the action and closer to where you might imagine the need is.”\nJust last year, Gilbert played for more than 500,000 fans while on the road with Keith and Eric Church. Since then, he has produced two number one hits—Country Must Be Country Wide and You Don’t Know Her Like I Do. Both went gold.\nHe also donated 10 tickets to troops stationed in the Manchester, England, area for his March 16 show at the Club Academy and made time to meet with them.\nHis experiences with the troops have definitely made a lasting impression.\n“It was like nothing I’d ever done before,” Gilbert said. “Me and the band all talked about it and we agree. Across the board … they were—every single one of them—the most appreciative audiences we’ve ever played for, and we’ve played a lot of shows.\n“I must tell you, honestly, I made friendships out there that I brought home with me,” Gilbert said. “Friendships I’ll have forever.”\nJoseph Andrew Lee is a USO staff writer.","Lee Brice (born Kenneth Mobley Brice, Jr., June 10, 1979) is an American country music singer and songwriter, signed to Curb Records. Brice has released four albums for the label: Love Like Crazy, Hard to Love, I Don't Dance and Lee Brice. He has also released eleven singles, of which four were written by his cousin, Michael Cericola, and have charted at number one on Billboard Hot Country Songs and Country Airplay: \"A Woman Like You\", \"Hard to Love\", \"I Drive Your Truck\", and \"I Don't Dance\". He has also charted within the top 10 with \"Love Like Crazy\", \"Parking Lot Party\", \"Drinking Class\", and \"That Don't Sound Like You\". \"Love Like Crazy\" was the top country song of 2010 according to Billboard Year-End, and broke a 62-year-old record for the longest run on the country chart.\nBrice at Country Throwdown Tour 2011\n|Birth name||Kenneth Mobley Brice, Jr.|\n|Born||June 10, 1979|\nSumter, South Carolina, U.S.\nBesides his own material, he has also co-written singles for artists like Garth Brooks, Adam Gregory, the Eli Young Band, and Tim McGraw. One of his compositions, Brooks's \"More Than a Memory\", was the first song ever to debut at number one on the country chart, while the Eli Young Band's \"Crazy Girl\" was the Billboard Year-End top country song of 2011.\nKenneth Mobley Brice, Jr. was born on June 10, 1979, in Sumter, South Carolina, to Kenneth, Sr. and Carleen Brice His younger brother, Lewis, was a contestant on Season 1 of Country Music Television's Can You Duet. As a child, he played piano and guitar, sang in church, and wrote his own songs. He entered and won three different talent contests in high school.\nHe attended Clemson University on a football scholarship. He played special teams there as the long snapper, but after an arm injury, he decided to focus on a country music career although he is not listed on any official Clemson roster.\nBy 2007, Brice began working as a songwriter, with cuts by Jason Aldean, Keith Gattis, and Cowboy Crush among others. Along with Billy Montana and Kyle Jacobs, he co-wrote Garth Brooks's 2007 single \"More Than a Memory\", the first single in the history of the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart to debut at number one.\nAlso in 2007, he signed to Curb Records, releasing his debut single \"She Ain't Right\", which peaked at number 29 on the country chart. It was followed by \"Happy Endings\" and \"Upper Middle Class White Trash\" at numbers 32 and 44. All three songs were to have been included on an album entitled Picture of Me, which was never released. He continued to write songs for others, including Canadian singer Adam Gregory's singles \"Crazy Days\" and \"What It Takes\". He appeared on Cledus T. Judd's 2007 album Boogity, Boogity – A Tribute to the Comedic Genius of Ray Stevens, singing duet vocals on a rendition of the Albert E. Brumley gospel song \"Turn Your Radio On\".\n2009–10: Love Like CrazyEdit\nIn August 2009, he charted with his fourth single, \"Love Like Crazy\", a song written by Tim James and Doug Johnson. It was the first release from his debut album of the same name, on which he co-produced all but one track with Johnson. \"Love Like Crazy\" reached top 10 on the Hot Country Songs chart in July 2010 during its forty-sixth week on the chart, setting a record for the slowest climb into the top 10. In September 2010, the song charted for a fifty-sixth week, making it the longest-charting song in the chart's history; it broke a record set by Eddy Arnold, whose 1948 single \"Bouquet of Roses\" spent fifty-four weeks on the chart. \"Love Like Crazy\" ultimately peaked at number 3. The album's second single was \"Beautiful Every Time\" at number 30. Also in 2010, Brice co-wrote labelmate Tim McGraw's single \"Still\".\n2011–present: Hard 2 Love, I Don't Dance and Lee BriceEdit\nBrice released his sixth single, \"A Woman Like You\", in late 2011. It was the first release from a second album for Curb, Hard 2 Love, which was released on April 24, 2012. In April 2012, it became his first number one on the Country Airplay chart. \"Hard to Love\" became his second number one in late 2012. The album's third single, \"I Drive Your Truck\", was released on December 3, 2012, and reached number one on the Country Airplay chart in 2013. The album's fourth single, \"Parking Lot Party\", was released to country radio on May 13, 2013 and peaked at number 6 on the Country Airplay chart in November 2013. Brice also co-produced the single \"Love Is War\" for the duo American Young, a duo whose membership includes \"A Woman Like You\" co-writer Jon Stone.\nIn early 2014, Brice released the single \"I Don't Dance\". It was the lead single to his third studio album of the same name, which was released on September 9, 2014. Brice produced the album by himself. \"I Don't Dance\" became Brice's fourth number one hit in August 2014. \"Drinking Class\" is the album's second single. it peaked at number two on the Country Airplay chart in May 2015. The album's third single, \"That Don't Sound Like You\" released to country radio on May 11, 2015.\nOn November 3, 2017, Brice released the self-titled album, Lee Brice. It is his fourth album and it was released via Curb Records. The album's lead single is \"Boy\", featuring 14 other songs.\nIn April 2013, Brice married his longtime girlfriend Sara Nanette Reeveley. The couple have three children: sons Takoda Brice-Reeveley (born in 2008) and Ryker Mobley Brice (born in 2013), and daughter Trulee Nanette Brice (born in 2017). Brice's cousin and often music inspiration, Michael Cericola, serves as the children's god father. Reeveley is featured on the track \"See About a Girl\" on Hard 2 Love.\nSongs written by Lee BriceEdit\n|2006||\"Beautiful High\"||Sister Hazel||Absolutely|\n|2007||\"Not Every Man Lives\"||Jason Aldean||Relentless|\n|\"More Than a Memory\"||Garth Brooks||The Ultimate Hits|\n|2008||\"All Said and Done\", \"Love Finds Everyone\"||Cory Morrow||Vagrants & Kings|\n|\"Tougher Than a Man\"||Cowboy Crush||Cowboy Crush|\n|2009||\"Crazy Days\", \"What It Takes\", \"Down the Road\"||Adam Gregory||Crazy Days|\n|\"Sorry Don't Matter\"||Jason Michael Carroll||Growing Up Is Getting Old|\n|\"Just Fine\"||Bomshel||Fight Like a Girl|\n|\"Still\"||Tim McGraw||Southern Voice|\n|2010||\"You'll Always Be Beautiful\"||Blake Shelton||Hillbilly Bone|\n|\"Homemade Mexico\"||Trailer Choir||Tailgate|\n|\"Seven Days\"||Kenny Chesney||Hemingway's Whiskey|\n|2011||\"Baby Blue Eyes\"||Josh Kelley||Georgia Clay|\n|\"All Night to Get There\"||Craig Campbell||Craig Campbell|\n|\"Where Did I Lose You\"||Mark Wills||Looking for America|\n|\"Crazy Girl\", \"I Love You\"||Eli Young Band||Life at Best|\n|2012||\"Only God Could Love You More\", \"Shinin' on Me\"||Jerrod Niemann||Free the Music|\n|\"Back Home\"||Charles Esten||The Music of Nashville, Season 1: The Complete Collection|\n|2013||\"Absolutely Nothing\"||Randy Houser||How Country Feels|\n|\"Wish I Had a Boat\"||Tyler Farr||Redneck Crazy|\n|\"Get Up\"||Robin Meade||Count on Me|\n|2014||\"Buzz Back Girl\", \"We Know How to Rock\"||Jerrod Niemann||High Noon|\n|\"Wasn't Gonna Drink Tonight\"||American Young||American Young (EP)|\n|2016||\"Boy\"||Faith Hill||Deep Tracks|\nAwards and nominationsEdit\n|2011||Academy of Country Music Awards||Song of the Year — \"Love Like Crazy\"||Nominated|\n|Single Record of the Year — \"Love Like Crazy\"||Nominated|\n|CMT Music Awards||USA Weekend Breakthrough Video of the Year — \"Love Like Crazy\"||Nominated|\n|2012||CMA Awards||New Artist of the Year||Nominated|\n|2013||ACM Awards||Top New Male Artist||Nominated|\n|Song of the Year — \"A Woman Like You\"||Nominated|\n|2014||Grammy Awards||Best Country Solo Performance — \"I Drive Your Truck\"||Nominated|\n|Best Country Song — \"I Drive Your Truck\"||Nominated|\n|2014||CMA Awards||Song of the Year — \"I Don't Dance\"||Nominated|\n- Phillips, Jessica (24 May 2010). \"Pictures of Lee: Hit songwriter Lee Brice puts the finishing touches on his debut album\".

{"question":"What are the main components of paint, and what additives are used to enhance its properties?","answer":"Paint consists of pigment (which provides color), binder (which holds the paint together and binds it to the substrate), and optionally solvents and additives. Pigments can be inorganic (from rocks/minerals/metals), organic (from living things), or artificial (chemically altered). The binder varies by paint type - oils for oil paint, acrylic polymer emulsion for acrylics, and gum arabic for watercolors. Various additives are used to enhance paint properties in four main ways: rheology modifiers improve flow and leveling, foam control agents prevent pinholes and gas pockets, antimicrobial/biocidal additives work against microorganisms, and wetting/dispersion additives support deflocculation and stabilization of pigments within the binder.","context":["From oil to egg yolks\nSame pigment, different binder.\nSame Pigment (dry crushed material), different binder (oil, plastic, etc)\nIn a nutshell that is how paints are made and the difference between mediums (oil, acrylic, watercolour, pastel, egg tempera)\nWhat are Oil Paints?\nHow do Oil paints dry?\nDry pigment is mixed with oil into a paste, that is why it takes such a long time to dry, it’s not the pigment but the oil. Just like if you spill some olive oil on the work-top it will take ages to dry.\nWhen the oil oxidizes (has contact with the air) it forms a solid film that binds the pigments together, like baking a cake, the mixture starts smooth, gets ‘cooked’ in the air and dries.\nOil paint can take anywhere between 6 months and a year to dry depending on the thickness of paint used.\nPigments start out as earth or rocks and are now often man-made, some of the oldest pigments are made from coloured earth, like yellow ochre and are called earth colours. Different oil colours have been created as new pigments and manufacturing methods have been developed.\nPigments can be divide into three camps:\nInorganic Pigments – compounds that were never made from a living thing, i.e rock/mineral/metal\nOrganic Pigments – substances that were once part of a living thing, animals/plants/synthetic treatment of plant stuff\nArtificial Pigments. These are often derived from organic pigments that have been chemically altered, they can make a more stable and even paint, the modern, very bright colours come from artificial pigments.\nA word of warning about Artificial Pigments\nFor those starting painting I wouldn’t recommend using all man-made pigments as they can ruin a painting more quickly that help it. I always adhere to the practice of starting with the dullest, most natural colours and creeping up on the stronger brighter colours. This helps you to think more tonally and will pay dividends in the long run. Initially this can seem boring for beginners because of the allure of all the bright paint, but working from black and white to full colour is a classical way of learning about painting and one that you have a much greater chance of producing a harmonious, balanced painting than being let loose with everything!\nThink small steps.\nWhat are Acrylic paints?\nAcrylic paint consists of pigment suspended in a binder of acrylic polymer emulsion. Water is the vehicle for the acrylic polymer emulsion instead of oil, that is the vehicle for oil paint. Here’s a glossary of acrylic painting terms.\nSo, which paint will suit you best?\nHave a look at the 5 key differences between oils and acrylic paint.\nDon’t get confused by Hue\nThe labeling on paints can be really confusing, ‘Hue’ in colour mixing land just means the colour of a paint, i.e. that yellow has a orangey hue to it. However in paint labelling Hue means ‘fake’ or ‘imitation’ so a label that says:\nCadmium Red Hue means that this isn’t a pure pigment made from Cadmium Red. Some of it might be Cadmium Red but it has been mixed with something else to give it the same colour. This used to be a sign of inferior quality paints but now it’s because some natural pigments are no longer available, not as light fast or extremely costly. You can read about the 8 key differences between student & artist grade paints here.\nWhat is Watercolor?\nWatercolor paints are pigments held together by a water-soluble binder, along with additives and solvents.\nIn commercially made watercolor paints, the binder is either natural gum Arabic or synthetic glycol. This is what holds the pigment in suspension. The binder also allows the pigment to adhere to the support (e.g. paper) once it is applied. Additives, such as plasticisers (e.g. glycerin) and humectants (e.g. honey or corn syrup), are mixed in to alter various characteristics of the watercolors, such as viscosity and durability of the paint. Other additives include extenders and dispersant’s.\nWhat are Pastels?\nPastels are usually in stick form, similar to chalk. A pastel stick consists of pure powdered pigment and a binder, such as gum Arabic, gum tragacanth, or methyl cellulose. Pastels have a higher pigment concentration than any other artist medium (hence the rich, luminous colors that pastels can achieve). The powdered pigments used in pastels are similar to those found in oil paints.\nPastels can be hard or soft. Soft pastels have more pigment and less binder, so they are easier to smudge and have brighter colors. Hard pastels have less pigment and more binder than soft pastels. Hard pastels can stay relatively sharp, so they are ideal for pastel artwork that requires tight detail.\nWhat is Egg Tempera?\nEgg tempera is composed of egg yolk, powdered pigment, and distilled water. The egg yolk serves as the binder that holds the pigment together. The addition of water turns the paint into a usable paste-like form. Manufactured egg tempera also includes gums that act as dispersant’s are like salt, grainy particles that can be milled and crushed to make smaller and smoother.\nPro Tip: To test the quality of a dry pigment, place a small amount in a glass jar, add water, give it a stir and leave for a few days. The solid particles of the dry pigment should float down to the bottom leaving the water clear. If it’s not clear some form of dye has been added to enhance the colour.\nSome Pigment Pointers:\nThere are some confusing aspects to knowing pigments. Keep these points in mind:\nSimilar pigments are sold under different trade names.\nFor example: Winsor Newton’s Winsor Blue, Liquitex’s Phthalo Blue and Grumbacher’s Phthalo Blue are all based on the same pigment: Phthalocyanine Blue.\nFact: The name “Yellow ochre” comes from Greek ochros = yellow, pale yellow\nYou might also like:\n1. Should you choose Oil paints or Acrylics?","Coating additives for special properties and reduced problems\nAt its most simplified, a paint or coating is the combination of a pigment, a binder (or resin), and optionally, a solvent and additives. The pigment is the substance which provides the coating with its colour, the binder provides both adhesion and cohesion, holding the paint together as well as binding it to the substrate, finally, the solvent gives the coating the necessary viscosity and flow in order for it to be most effectively applied to a substrate. A paint takes its name from the binder used, such as polyurethane or epoxy. Coating additives are the component that imparts special or desired qualities and characteristics to the coating, or reduces problems that may hinder the production process.\nThe properties altered or enhanced by coating additives include viscosity, foaming, rheology, and odour. In this article we take a look at the additives commonly used in coatings and their effects.\nCoating additives influence coating quality in 4 ways\nThe reason for including additives in a coating is to heighten its performance or add extra properties not otherwise provided by the coating alone – such as with antimicrobial or biocidal additives. Additives can be used for coatings from all sectors, for architectural coatings, industrial coatings, powder coatings, protective and marine coatings, automotive coatings, and more. The full range of additive qualities is too extensive to cover here, but includes surface altering additives, adhesion promoters, anti-caking agents, nanotechnology-based additives, UV-absorbers, flame-retardant additives, corrosion inhibitors, etc. Below are four of the main qualities modified by additives and why they matter to a coating.\n1. Improve flow and levelling: Rheology modifiers\nRheology is the branch of physics that deals with the study of ‘flow’. Rheological characteristics or flow behaviours in coating include viscosity, sedimentation, and sagging. Rheology modifiers work to alter the flow and levelling of a coating, and so are also called flow and levelling agents. These are one of the more important classes of additives simply because there are so many problems and defects that can occur in the film forming stage of coating when the rheology of the paint is not optimal. A rheology modifier improves a paint’s viscosity while also improving its application and flow characteristics. They also prevent pigments from sedimenting within a container during storage.\nThese rheology additives work by affecting viscosity and flow behaviour, including the shear rate, to reduce issues like sagging and sedimentation. Shear rate is the rate at which fluid layers move past each other. In Newtonian fluids this is a constant, so viscosity does not change, but most fluids are non-Newtonian and their viscosities are dependent on the differing shear rates. With paint this matters because a coating endures many different shear rates from production (dispersing, blending) to application (rolling, brushing, or spraying) and storage. Rheology modifiers adapt the flow behaviour of a coating to ensure the viscosity is ideal for application.\n|Additive Company||Coating Additive Product||Description|\n|Allnex||Additol XL 270||Multi purpose additive to improve rheology and prevent settling. A special fatty acid modified silicone.|\n|BASF||Efka RM 1920||A hydrogenated castor oil additive for excellent sag resistance with non-aqueous formulations.|\n|BYK/Altana||Aquatix 8421||A wax emulsion to improve the effect pigment orientation in aqueous formulations for automotive OEM coatings.|\n|Dow Coating Materials||ACRYSOL HASE Rheology Modifiers||A range of coating additives which contain methacrylic acid and acrylate ester. They provide a thickening of the coating with higher film build and sag resistance.|\n2. Prevent pinholes and gas pockets: Foam control agents\nFoam is the distribution of a gas through a liquid which can cause defects in coating application such as pinholes and gas pockets. In this way, foam negatively affects both the aesthetic and protective functions of a coating. A surfactant (from surface-active agent) is a substance that helps determine the surface tension behaviour of liquids at the liquid/liquid, liquid/gas, or liquid/solid interface. They are amphiphilic molecules, meaning they have both hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups (their tails and heads respectively). Foam forms due to the interaction of these groups between the ‘surfaces’ of the individual foam bubbles. To counteract the effects of these surfactants defoamers are used.\nDefoamers either prevent the formation of foam or they quickly destroy the foam produced. They do this by displacing the foam-stabilising surfactants which maintain the foam and replacing them with a film which is not capable of generating the forces required to maintain bubbles. Essentially the foam is deprived of its structural integrity. The more defoamer is used the better the defoaming effect, but this comes at the price of an increase in defects. The dosage needs to be determined carefully to balance the two.\nFoam control additive products and companies\nThe importance of foam control in coatings means that it is a widely supplied product in Australia. Companies include Air Products and Chemicals Inc (Airase defoamers and deaerators), Borchers OM Group (Borchers AF 0550 and Borchi line), and BYK/Altana(BYK-012, BYK-016, BYK-052 N and more)\n3. Work against microorganisms: Antimicrobial/biocidal additives\nA biocide is a substance that kills or inhibits the growth of organisms through chemical or biological means. Biocides are used to prevent the buildup of biofouling on ship bottoms with antifouling paint, to prevent the growth and spread of harmful microorganisms across hospital and food preparation surfaces in antimicrobial coating, or to prevent the growth of mould and mildew in exterior paints. The biocides used in these paints include silver, copper, zinc oxide, as well as a variety of organic additives.\nAs well as using biocides as part of the purpose and end use of a coating, biocides can be used to extend the life of a coating and prevent it deteriorating. Coatings are vulnerable to microbial contamination at all stages from production to application because a majority of them include water which makes them susceptible to the growth of bacteria, algae, and fungi. By adding a biocide the paint is guarded against the possibility of microbial attack and product spoilage.\n4. Support deflocculation and stabilisation: Wetting and dispersion additives\nWetting and dispersion is an important step in the homogeneous distribution of solid pigments within the liquid binder. Pigments are added to a paint in the form of a powder, and the combination of dry powder and liquid binder leads to ‘clumping’ or agglomerates. These agglomerates are broken down through mechanical forces (think whisking flour into a pancake batter) and smaller particles are formed which have a far greater surface area in contact with the binder. When clumping forms again the interstitial spaces are filled with binder not air and these groups are called flocculates. This process is known as ‘wetting’ because the pigments are being wetted by the binder solution. The work of wetting additives is to accelerate the wetting of the pigment agglomerates.\nOnce the pigments are wetted, their optimum dispersion needs to be ensured. Flocculation causes poorer colour strength, decreased gloss, and it also changes the rheology of the coating. Ideally pigments are stabilised at the point where they have formed wetted particles, before intermolecular forces draw them back together to form flocculates. This is the job of the dispersion additive: they act to improve the stabilisation of the dispersion of the pigment. A dispersion additive adsorbs on the surface of the pigment and works against the attractive intermolecular forces that cause flocculation, keeping the particles apart. With deflocculation comes improved pigment utilisation, colour expression, levelling, and reduced viscosity.\n|Additive Company||Coating Additive Product||Description|\n|BYK/Altana||Anti-Terra U||Wetting and dispersing additive for solvent-borne industrial and architectural coatings to stabilize inorganic pigments|\n|Dow Coating Materials||Tamol 2011||A hydrophobic polyacid copolymer with efficient pigment stabilization through charge-charge repulsion.|\n|Ethox Chemicals LLC||E-Sperse 4754||A dispersant for inorganic pigments in solvent and resin based formulations, particularly mixed metal oxides and TiO2, in the aerospace industry.|\n|Evonik||Carbowet 300||A solvent and APE-free surfactant for resinated pigment dispersions.|\nCoating Additives Australia: manufacturers, products and suppliers\nThe above list is just a few of the different additive types available for coating. The top five global coating additives companies are AkzoNobel, Altana/BYK, BASF, Evonik Industries, and the Dow Chemical Company. As well as these big global players, smaller companies make up a significant share of the market. Other companies include Allnex, Arkema, Crayvallac, Clariant, Coatex, Pilot, Siltech, Unimin and more.\nDue to the sensitive nature of coatings, additives are not one size fits all. As a result, coating additives companies produce a broad range of additive solutions to suit your needs. For example, the BASF catalogue has 56 different products for dispersing agents for general industrial coatings. BYK/Altana has a portfolio of hundreds of coating additives suitable for many application areas, including industrial coatings, can coatings, coil coatings, wood and furniture coatings, powder coatings, and protective and marine coatings.\nWhether wetting and dispersing, rheology modifying, surface additives, corrosion and fire resistant, or antimicrobial, there is an additive for your project.

{"question":"Which project requires more specialized equipment - recycled paper making or birdhouse construction?","answer":"Recycled paper making requires more specialized equipment, including screens with wooden frames, blenders, specific fabric materials like denim for water absorption, and various containers for pulp. In contrast, birdhouse construction uses more common woodworking tools like a hammer, screws, electric drill, and basic materials like plywood and dowels.","context":["Large mouth juice bottles are the best way to start your recycled paper project. Add shredded paper until the bottle is ¾ of the way full of paper.\nFill the bottle just over half way with warm water.\nMeanwhile, make sure that a workspace and supplies are ready. I spread out thick layers of denim fabric to help soak up water.\nScreens made from simple wooden frames screwed together with screen stapled on the side are all I use. Eric and I put a whole class set together in a matter of a few hours. These are placed over buckets that just fit the screen. In a class of about 15, I used three screens and it seemed to work out that there was always a screen available.\nI keep plenty of bottles and extra caps available. That way, if a student needs more time the next class period, he/she can simply use masking tape and a marker to label his or her bottle.\nThis is the bottle and its contents after about 10 minutes of shaking. The paper starts to break down into paper pulp quite quickly. The partners work well because the triceps may start to get a little tired – especially if the bottle is fuller.\nIf you like, you can speed up the process with a blender. I have a few donated old blenders, but I have found that the cheap brand new ones actually work the best.\nCover tightly. I keep plenty of rags and a few Sham Wows around to mop up spills. I used this time to teach a little science to the kiddos about water and electricity not mixing. Blend until smooth.\nTo change the color of the paper, you can use a variety of methods – dye, colored paper, or plants. Here, I used black construction paper. This is a great time to revisit the color wheel and the mixing of colors. We revisit the color wheel and I always remind my students that if you mix all the colors of shredded paper together you will get mud. Still, there are always a few who complain about their ‘vomit’ paper.\nEmbellishments are another fun way to make recycled paper more interesting. A few things to add but maybe not all at once: glitter, foil, candy wrappers, bits of flowers or herbs, small beads, or cut up ribbon or string. Here, I added strips of aluminum foil with the paper pulp.\nI requested my colleagues save foil chocolate wrappers for me – a great time to ask is before Christmas, Halloween or Valentine’s Day. I was always delighted to find baggies of foil wrappers in my box – I am sure some colleagues think I am quite the pack rat! When we start making paper the kids inevitable want to know if I like chocolate. 🙂\nAfter your paper is blended into a smooth pulp, pour it into a screen set up in one of the bins. Gently press some of the water out into the bucket below. Be careful not to press too hard, or your screen could come detached from the frame.\nPress out as much remaining water as possible on a flat surface, such as the denim fabric, felt, or newspaper.\nPress even more water out.\nThis would be a good time to say that making your stamp before you start your paper making is smart planning. Create embossing stamps out of Styrofoam. I like to rescue clean trays from the cafeteria to repurpose into stamping materials. These two stamps were simply drawn with ballpoint pen and then cut with scissors. I pressed them into the top of the wet paper.\nA simple, yet interesting, relief stamp can be made from multiple layers of Styrofoam, such as this smiling face. Cut out the shapes, glue, and allow to dry before pressing into the wet paper.\nI have found that the stamps work best if the stamps are placed on the fabric and then the paper is turned on top of the stamps. This way, you can press the paper onto the stamps and create a better impression.\nOne of my more favorite embellishments can be found in your kitchen. Onion peels – yellow or red can be added to paper pulp for an interesting dye technique.\nWhen initially blended, the color appear quite faint.\nOnce the paper is fully dry, the onion color shows up much more vibrantly. These are two examples of the the embossing stamps once dry.\nThe possibilities for recycled paper projects are endless. Here are a few ideas:\n- Paint them for more depth.\n- Use recycled paper in place of plaster or clay for hand prints.\n- Turn them into greeting cards.\n- Make recycled jewelry.\n- Make recycled paper bowls.\n- Turn two sheets into the front and back of a book.\n- Use the paper pulp as a sculpting material, make a 3D object, and then brush with watered down glue to hold it together.\nCheck back soon for more projects involving recycled paper.","HOW TO: Build a Birdhouse\n💪 DIFFICULTY RATING: 30%\n⏱ TIME: 2 Hours\nAn ever popular addition to the nation’s gardens, a bird box will allow you both to breathe life into your outdoor space and to welcome the sights and sounds of the UK’s wildlife to your own back garden.\nThis is a relatively simple DIY project, provided you have basic woodworking experience. Depending on how long it takes the glue to dry, this can be easily achieved in under two hours (though don’t beat yourself up if it takes longer!) It is certainly the ideal project for a summer’s weekend.\nThis guide provides you with step-by-step instructions on putting together a basic hanging birdhouse, providing a warm, dry and comfortable home for a wide variety of small UK birds.\nWhat you’ll need…\nSheet of plywood\nHammer (Available at Eurofit Direct)\nScrews (Available at Eurofit Direct)\nL brackets (Available at Eurofit Direct)\nExterior wood glue\nElectric drill and hole cutting bit\n¼” dowel (Available at Eurofit Direct)\nEye bolts/hanging hooks (Available at Eurofit Direct)\nWater based latex paint in woodland colours (natural green, grey or brown)\nStep 1: Cutting the Wood\nTo create the birdhouse, you’re going to need to measure and cut 6 pieces of wood, to the following sizes:\n- 1 x 6 ¼“ piece of 6×1 timber (for the bottom)\n- 1 x 5 ½” piece of 6×1 timber (for the bottom)\n- 1 x 9” piece of 6×1 timber (for the roof)\n- 1 x 8 ½” piece of 6×1 timber (for the roof)\n- 2 x 7” square pieces of plywood (for the front and back panels)\nOnce you’ve cut your wood, cut your dowel to a length of around 4 – 5“.\nStep 2: Assembling The Bottom and Back\nTake your two pieces for the bottom of the bird box, then glue the shorter piece to the inside edge of the longer piece at a 90 degree angle, so that both sides of the completed box end up the same length.\nLet the glue dry, before securing them in place with a couple of wood screws or nails for extra stability.\nNow, take one of your 7” square pieces of plywood, and glue it flush to the inside of the back edges of both bottom sections of your box to create a back panel.\nWait for the glue to dry, and secure it properly in place with 4 screws.\nStep 3: Adding The Roof\nPlace the birdhouse on your work surface, laying it down flat on its back panel.\nNow, take the two roof pieces, and fit them to the bottom and back panel of the bird box, with the shorter piece connecting flush to the inside edge of the longer piece, so that both sides of the roof are the same length.\nGlue them in place, and then once the glue has dried, secure the roof pieces together with screws, before screwing the roof to the bottom pieces.\nFor extra stability and support, you can now add your L braces to the centres of the four corners of your box, further securing the roof and the bottom pieces.\nStep 4: The Front Panel\nDraw diagonal pencil lines from the corners of the front panel to find the centre point. Now, mark a point along one of the lines about 2 ½” from the corner – this will mark the top point of the entry hole you are about to drill, using a 1 3/8” (35mm) hole drill bit.\nOnce you’ve drilled the entry hole, measure a point about ½ – ¾” below the bottom of the entry hole, and mark a point on the line.\nDrill a ¼” hole, and glue your dowel in place to create an outside perch for the birds.\nOnce the perch has dried, add your front panel to the birdhouse, gluing and then screwing it securely in place.\nStep 5: Finishing Touches\nSand down the surfaces of your birdhouse, paying special attention to the dowel perch and the hole, to ensure that there are no splinters or sharp edges that could cause injury to birds as they go in and out.\nAdd the hanging hooks at equal points to the top of your bird box.\nTIP: you may find it helpful to pre-drill the holes, which will also ensure you don’t split the wood or damage the structure.\nNow, you can paint your birdhouse. When choosing paint, make sure you go for a non-toxic, water-based latex paint, or a natural stain, as creosote and lead paints can be poisonous.\nTIP: The idea is for the birdhouse to blend into its surroundings, so go for natural, camouflage colours."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4498195d-34a2-4bb4-af22-e0b6ae3071d4>","<urn:uuid:59cfe06d-4d3c-4cbd-90d1-d37f5ea74c81>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Does positive feedback work same way in Earth's climate and human body - makes changes bigger or smaller?","answer":"Positive feedback works the same way in both Earth's climate and human body - it amplifies changes. In Earth's climate, positive feedback means a change is being amplified by other Earth-system processes, like when ice melting leads to decreased albedo which causes more warming. Similarly, in human biological systems, positive feedback amplifies or magnifies changes - the response effect is enhanced so it occurs faster, as seen in examples like childbirth where contractions become progressively stronger.","context":["Answers to Chapter 16 Review Questions\n1. A positive feedback does not mean that something good is happening in the Earth system. Rather, it means that a change is being amplified by other Earth-system processes that were triggered by the change. From a human perspective, having a change amplified could be good or bad.\n2. When ice is present, relatively small changes in temperature can trigger albedo feedbacks that amplify the change. If no ice is present, a small increase in temperature might not have much of an impact. But if ice is present, that small increase could be enough to cause the ice to melt, and decrease Earth’s albedo. If ice is created when the climate cools, further cooling can be triggered if the ice increases Earth’s albedo significantly.\n3. We use 65° for estimating the glaciation potential of orbital variations because glaciers are most likely to form at high latitudes, where temperatures are cooler, and insolation less direct. We use 65° N rather than 65° S because for more than 50 million years the continents have been concentrated in the northern hemisphere. We use July instead of January, because for ice to form and remain year-round, it is necessary to have cool summers.\n4. Gondwana was situated over the south pole for much of the Paleozoic. Not only was the land subject to temperatures cooler over all, and less direct insolation for part of the year, but the large size of the continent limited the extent to which heat from the ocean could reach the interior of the continent. The development of ice on Gondwana further cooled the planet through albedo feedback.\n5. If the major currents in the oceans were to slow down or stop, the tropics would get hotter and the high-latitude areas would get colder, leading to expansion of glaciers and sea ice. The various feedbacks (e.g., higher albedo because of increased ice cover) would result in a cooler climate over all.\n6. From a climate perspective, the two important volcanic gases are SO2 and CO2. SO2 is converted to aerosols which block sunlight and can lead to short-term cooling (lasting years). CO2 can lead to warming, but only in situations where there is an elevated level of volcanism over the long term.\n7. Greenhouse gases vibrate at frequencies that are similar to those of infrared radiation. When infrared radiation hits a greenhouse gas molecule, the molecule’s vibrational energy is enhanced and the radiation energy is converted into heat, which is trapped within the atmosphere.\n8. Proxy data can provide information about climate in the distant past, for times during which there were no direct measurements. As new techniques are developed, analyses of proxy data can improve, whereas direct measurements will have experimental errors related to the instruments used to make them at the time. A disadvantage of proxy data is that we don’t always have a detailed timeline to go with the data, and may need to rely on other lines of evidence to understand when the proxy data should apply. Special equipment or techniques may be needed to get proxy data from geological materials. It is also necessary to ensure that geological processes have not altered the materials in some way that makes the results of analyses unreliable.\n9. Real-life measurements are used to set up the model, and to test that it can provide realistic results. Many different models may be used to study the same scenario, and the results compared. This helps scientists to compare the results of representing the Earth system in different ways. An estimate of uncertainty is provided so scientists can decide whether or not the range of uncertainty is too big, given the size of the Earth-system change being studied.\n10. Data from ice cores and direct measurements show that atmospheric CO2 levels began to rise very rapidly at the same time that humans began using fossil fuels extensively to power activities like manufacturing and transportation. At the same time, the stable carbon-isotope composition of atmospheric CO2 began to decrease at a rate that is consistent with the stable carbon-isotope fingerprint of plant-derived organic matter. Also simultaneously, the radiocarbon age of atmospheric CO2 began to fall, consistent with carbon from very ancient plant sources being added to the atmosphere. Aside from the timing of geochemical changes matching the onset of the industrial era, there are no other sources of carbon that can account for the geochemical fingerprint in the atmosphere.\n11. The reason that relatively small anthropogenic flows of carbon into the carbon cycle can have a big impact is that they aren’t being balanced by natural processes that can remove the extra carbon. The result is that carbon from anthropogenic activities is accumulating in the atmosphere and ocean.\n12. In the past, Earth’s climate has been both much colder and much hotter than today. However, present day temperatures are significantly different compared to global average temperatures over the past 1000 years, and stand out in the data from the past 800,000 years. Atmospheric CO2 levels are much higher than at any time during the past 800,000 years, and on that timescale, the increase is almost instantaneous. Therefore, the magnitude of present-day change in the Earth-system stands out clearly from background conditions predating the appearance of anatomically modern humans. It is also happening much faster than even the most rapid carbon-release event that we know of in the rock record.\n13. Climate warming happens more rapidly at high latitudes more than low latitudes, decreasing the temperature difference between them. The decreased difference allows atmospheric circulation patterns to “stall out” over a location for longer than usual. What would normally be a short heatwave lasts much longer, and a precipitation event that would normally move elsewhere after a short time is now halted in place for weeks.\n14. See Figure 16.44. The power of tropical storms depends on the warmth of seawater. Data show that during particularly warm intervals, tropical storms are stronger. Data also show that the strength of storms over all is increasing as sea surface temperatures rise over time.\n15. Frozen soils provide a solid foundation for buildings in northern communities. Melting of permafrost means the soil beneath buildings is weakened, and buildings can suffer structural damage. Thawing means that hillsides are more prone to mass wasting, especially terrain along coasts. In terms of the climate system, thawing of permafrost allows micro-organisms to decompose organic matter within previously-frozen sediments, releasing additional CO2 and CH4, and contributing to a positive feedback.","Definition: A loop system wherein the system responds to a perturbation. The response may be in the same direction (as in positive feedback) or in the opposite direction (as in negative feedback).\nTable of Contents\nPositive Feedback Definition\nEach mechanism of the body like temperature, blood pressure, and levels of specific nutrients has to be in the optimum range so that the body can function properly. An optimum value is a normal value about which the standard range varies. Keeping the standard or optimum range keeps the body healthy and stable. Various biological mechanisms work on the input and output of the body given as the result of a certain stimulus.\nThe feedback loop contains two major forms: (1) positive feedback and (2) negative feedback. They work to maintain body equilibrium under different conditions. Feedback loops are biological mechanisms in which the living body’s internal stability is maintained depending on its response. It happens when the product of action or any output alters the body’s response.\nWhat is positive feedback? Positive feedback is amplifying or magnifying the change or output. The response effect is magnified so that it can occur much faster. In this form of feedback, the output of the system is enhanced. Conversely, in negative feedback, the output is decreased or inhibited.\nFeedback loops play an important role in order to preserve homeostasis. Homeostasis is the maintenance of an internal environment of the body from the harm and fluctuation of the external environment and helps in maintaining body stability.\nMaintaining homeostasis depends upon two major factors:\n1. Type of organism\n2. Habitat of the organism\nFor example, a cold-blooded animal, like fish, maintains a lower body temperature according to the external environment whereas a warm-blooded animal like a whale preserves higher body temperature to maintain internal stability.\nPositive feedback is known as a positive response or a self-reinforcing response to external or internal input. In this, the effector boosts up the stimulus that enhances the product formation for maintaining body stability. Positive feedback promotes a change in the physiological state instead of reversing it.\nWhat is a positive feedback loop? Positive feedback involves a physiological system that reinforces the change (works to reinforce or intensify the change). The variation is sensed by the receptor, and then the effector works to produce the identical outcome – this enhances the physiological change. The actual change will continue to amplify by the positive feedback loop until the stimulus is removed.\nPositive feedback is amplifying or magnifying the change or output. The response effect is magnified so that it can occur much faster. In this form of feedback, the output of the system is enhanced. Conversely, in negative feedback, the output is decreased or inhibited. It is characterized by having a system responding to the perturbation in the same direction as the perturbation and resulting in the amplification or growth of the output signal.\nCompare: negative feedback\nPositive Feedback Examples\nWhat is an example of positive feedback in homeostasis? Let’s take a look at some of the examples: clot formation, childbirth, fruit ripening, and menstrual cycle. Each one depicts what a positive feedback mechanism is like:\n- Clotting factors are released to seal a wound\n- At the time of baby birth, there is a dilation of the walls of the uterus that causes a contraction that encourages further stretching (this continues until birth)\n- In fruit ripening, there is the release of ethylene, which will continue the ripening process of fruits\n- In the menstrual cycle, the estrogen hormone promotes the secretion of other hormones that will lead to ovulation.\nBlood clot formation\nOne of the major examples of positive feedback is the effort of the body in reversing the damage caused by any injury. When the body gets injured the major threat to life is excessive loss of blood. Blood pressure and blood flow at the site of injury are reduced. At the site of the injury, blood clotting factors are released to initiate blood clotting. Once the process begins it promotes the clotting process further. Thus, overall, the process of sealing the injured site is speeded up. Clotting factors are responsible for the formation of a clot in the injured or wounded area. This is one of the life-saving examples of positive feedback.\n• The onset of contractions in childbirth is also known as the Ferguson reflex.\n• In the case of childbirth, the growth of the baby eventually causes the uterine walls to expand, which are reflected by the stretch receptors\n• This stretching will trigger the secretion of oxytocin hormones that activate the uterine muscles and it causes the reduction in the space of the uterus\n• It causes more stretching of the uterus and consequently more contractions will happen until the original stimulus (fetus) is removed (i.e., birth)\nRipening of fruit\nThe ripening of fruit is another example of a system employing positive feedback. If you observe a plant or a tree bearing lots of fruits, you will notice the fruits go through the stages: from unripe to ripe to overripe. The process will start when the first fruit begins to ripen. When it is ripe, it releases a gas which is known as ethylene (C2H4). This causes the nearby fruits exposed to the ethylene to begin to ripen. As the ripening continues, these fruits also continue to release ethylene gas. This feedback loop is usually used in the production of fruits in which exposure to ethylene gas makes the ripening process faster.\nThe estrogen hormone starts to release in the ovary before a female ovulates. The estrogen hormone travels to the brain and causes the secretion of two other hormones. The hypothalamus is activated to release gonadotropin hormone while the pituitary gland is stimulated to release luteinizing hormone. Luteinizing hormone, in turn, enhances the release of estrogen. An increase in the levels of these hormones as well as of follicle-stimulating hormones leads to ovulation.\nParts of Positive Feedback Loop\nThere are four major four components involved in maintaining homeostasis. These are:\n2. Sensor (Receptor)\n3. Control Centre\nThe stimulant can be any external substance that disturbs the homeostasis of the body (it is the process of maintaining balance in all body systems). The stimulus is provided by controlled variables. In general, the stimulus causes the optimum range to be moved or fluctuate from the normal or standard range. Physical injuries, infections, or any fluctuation in the external environment are some cases of stimulus. They disrupt the physiological functions of the body.\nThe sensor is also known as the receptor. This component of the feedback system detects physiological value. The sensor senses the variation in body equilibrium. It not only monitors the extent of change but also sends signals to the control center. For example, nerve cells of the cervix perceive the fetus’s head pressure during childbirth. The sensory nerves from the sensor will report the change to the control center.\nThe control center is a part of the feedback system that compares the extent of fluctuation to the normal value. It not only receives signals from sensors but also processes the information. The control center in the brain detects the changes, compares them with the normal values. If the value is not within the optimum range, an immediate signal to the effector is sent by the control center to maintain body equilibrium.\nThe pituitary gland is located near the brain, which is the control center of numerous response processes. Various hormones like oxytocin, antidiuretic hormone, and growth hormone are released from it, in response to the stimulus.\nThe effector can be any muscle, organ, gland, or any other structure that gives a response to the stimulus according to the signal received from the control center. The effector either opposes or enhances the stimulus. The response of the effector depends on the command received by a control center.\nThe goal of the effector is to maintain stability by moving the variable back near the standard point.\nFor example, the result of positive feedback in the case of labor is the contraction of the uterus. So here the effector organ is the uterus.\nPositive Feedback vs Negative Feedback:\nFeedback loops are biological procedures that help to maintain homeostasis in the body. This occurs when a product or event occurs and it alters the response of the body.\nA positive feedback loop maintains the direction of the stimulus and probably makes the action faster. A case of the positive feedback loops present in the animal body is an explosion of chemical reactions that lead to blood clotting also known as coagulation. In this, as one clotting factor activates it will continue to activate others in a sequence until a clot, fibrin, is formed. In this process, the direction of the event is maintained, not changed, so it’s positive feedback.\nContractions at childbirth and fruit ripening are examples of positive feedback.\nA negative feedback loop happens to lessen the change. The response effect is attenuated to restore the system to a stable state. Negative feedback happens to minimize the change or output. The effect of the response is reduced to restore the system to an even and steady condition. Modification in the direction of the stimulus in any homeostatic process is a loop of negative feedback. Negative feedback increases or decreases the stimulus but does not let the stimulus continue its process. In other words, when the levels are high, the body performs its effort to lower it and in contrast, when the level is low, the body does its action so the level can be raised.\nExamples of negative feedback include regulating the level of glucose in the blood and osmoregulation. Another is thermoregulation. Whenever body temperature deviates, the mechanism starts to work to restore it to normal range.\nThe negative response occurs more often than the positive response in the homeostatic body processes. Many illnesses are caused by a disturbance in the original body system.\nThe action is increased in positive feedback as the level of productivity is higher. Therefore, the response effect is amplified ultimately in the end. In contrast, negative feedback inhibits the rate of action as a particular situation develops which either leads to harmful consequences. Therefore, the response to the reaction is inhibited.\nNegative feedback is strongly related to stability as compared to positive feedback because negative feedback minimizes the effects of stimuli. On the other hand, the positive response causes production, which sometimes causes variability.\nNegative feedback shows resistance to the alterations because it works to maintain the mechanism of the body to its actual state and reverse the change. However, positive feedback tends to support the transformation and changes.\nA positive response frequently needs exterior interference to stop its working. For instance, when the body is in circulatory shock then it receives many positive feedbacks to handle the emergency. In such a condition, the blood pressure continues to fall which may lead to cardiac failure. In such cases, medical treatment is required to stop the positive feedback.\nOn the other hand, negative feedback is simply independent. It will stop when stability is achieved.\nDeprived of feedback, stability in the internal system of the body cannot be achieved. It means that the body lessens its capacity to control its systems. Although negative feedback is very common in maintaining stability the positive feedback is also significant. Below are some examples that will represent the biological importance of feedback.\nHormonal response pattern: hormone concentration in plasma depends on the following aspects, such as secretion rate and hormone concentration in the circulation.\nThe hypothalamus secretes corticotropin hormone, which promotes the pituitary gland to release adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH promotes the adrenal gland to release cortisol. As ACTH concentration begins to rise in plasma, it sends a signal to the hypothalamus to stop the secretion of CRH. In the same way, as the level of cortisol increases in plasma, it “returns” to the pituitary gland and hypothalamus to prevent the secretion of adrenocorticotropic and corticotropin hormones, respectively. Therefore, a slight fluctuation in the specified area leads to the corrective action on the other side. In this way, negative feedback helps prevent extreme hormonal release.\nIn lactation, there is a nerve response in the spinal cord due to nipple sucking. This response ascends to the hypothalamus which causes the stimulation of the pituitary gland. Thus, more prolactin is produced which promotes milk production.\nAnother important feature of positive feedback is to increase the level of estrogen during the menstrual cycle phase will lead to ovulation. The production of sensory nerve signals is also an important biological factor of positive responses.\nAs for the nerve fiber, the membrane causes a small leak of sodium ions through sodium channels. This will lead to a change in membrane potential, which ultimately leads to the opening of multiple sodium channels (Hodgkin cycle). The first small leak causes an explosion of sodium leaks, which is essential to the propagation of the nerve action potential.\nPositive feedback is also helpful in maintaining the other processes of cell signaling, like enzyme kinetics or physiological mechanisms. Positive feedback can be used to increase the action of B cells. When the B cell binds its antibodies to an antigen, this leads to an immune process wherein more antibodies are produced and released.\nApoptosis is the programmed cell death that aims to remove damaged and unwanted cells from the body. If this process does not work properly it will lead to some serious consequences like cancer. The very core of this process is the auto-activation of caspases, which may be followed by a positive feedback loop.\nTry to answer the quiz below to check what you have learned so far about Positive Feedback.\n1.

{"question":"I'm interested in military helmets - are the German WWII Zeltbahn and the PASGT Kevlar helmet both designed to serve multiple purposes beyond head protection?","answer":"While both items had protective functions, they served different types of purposes. The WWII German Zeltbahn was not actually a helmet but a multi-purpose triangular shelter quarter that could be used both as a tent component and as a poncho. As a tent piece, four sections could be combined to create a pyramidal tent, and larger 8-man and 16-man configurations were possible. When worn as a poncho, it protected from rain and could be specially fastened by motorcyclists and bicyclists to protect their legs. In contrast, the PASGT Kevlar helmet was specifically designed for ballistic protection of the head from fragmenting munitions, with its only additional features being replaceable components like the headband, chin strap, and webbing suspension system. It did not transform into other types of equipment.","context":["by: Randy Harvey [ ]\nThe World War II German Zeltbahn (ground tent) individual shelter quarter served both as a tent and as a poncho. It was made of highly water-repellent duck cloth in the form of a triangle approximately 6 feet 3 inches along the base and 8 feet 3 inches along the other two sides. There were buttons and buttonholes on all three edges. The shelter quarter was covered with various camouflage patterns with some having different patterns on each side, greens on one side and browns on the other. Along with the Zeltbahn each soldier was issued two tent pins and one tent-pole section for use when the shelter quarter was made into a tent.\nOrdinarily four men put their sections together to make a small pyramidal tent. Other combinations were possible; the most common being eight and 16-man tents. The eight-man tent was constructed by erecting two three-sided pyramids and buttoning an inverted shelter half in the space between them. The 16-man tent was made by joining four of the long sides of the eight-man tent. A regular, four-section, pyramidal tent was erected on this base. The tent stood over 9 feet high. When worn as a poncho, the shelter quarter provided good protection from rain because of its excellent water-repellent property. The soldier's head was inserted through a slit with the narrow point of the triangle in front. The two rear points were brought forward and buttoned together. Slits were left open for the arms, where the poncho draped like sleeves. Motorcyclists and bicyclists could also fasten the shelter quarter around the thighs to cover and offer protection for their legs.\nJís Work has released WWII German Army Shelter Tent 3, number PPA3086, in 1/35 scale in their Diorama Accessories Series and it comes with four separate German shelter quarters which can combined to form a four-man tent during World War II. The kit is made in China and it is in the 14 range meaning that it is suitable for ages 14 to adult. The kit comes with one paper sheet with four pre-cut individual German shelter quarters in Platanenmuster 1939 Ė 1942 in the spring-summer pattern. Platanenmuster (plane-tree) 1939 Ė 1942 came in a brown autumn-winter color scheme and a green spring-summer pattern.\nThe autumn-winter variant came in a four color design of black, earth brown, and yellow ochre on a chocolate brown background. The spring-summer variant came in a four color design of black, dark olive, and spring green on a chocolate brown background. The shelters come with perforations to make it easy to make all of the folds. The shelter quarters can be used to make a four man tent or they could be used individually if desired. Although I did not try it I am sure that the shelter quarters could be placed on a 1/35 scale figure as a poncho. An additional benefit with the kit, after the construction, is the left over camouflage sections on the sheet that is left behind after the four sections are removed. These will prove to be a valuable asset to the modeler as the pieces can be used to scratch-build shelter quarters that are folded, wadded up, hanging from a branch or a piece of equipment, thrown on the ground, etc.\nThe instruction sheet included in the kit is a single page very basic assembly guide. I personally would have liked to have seen a better detailed sheet including a few step by step instructions in regards to the folding order and which portions to glue.\nThe kit comes sealed within a clear plastic bag which contains the single paper sheet kit itself as well as the instruction sheet.\nThe assembly is very straight forward and is very easy to understand. Being pre-cut the shelter quarters are easy to remove from the main sheet. The modeler will need to remove the small attachment points left behind from removing the shelters from the main sheet. There is not recommended adhesive listed on the instruction sheet or on the Jís Work website. I would recommend the basic white glue or a glue stick. I assembled these with a glue stick as I like the way it works and the adhesion is all but immediate. The shelters were easy to fold into the correct shape due to the perforations. The flaps on the sides of each shelter quarter make it convenient to glue the pieces together. Once I glued them into place I was able to make the final creases to put the shelter into its correct shape. The completed shelter measures 2 3/4 inches wide at the base on all four sides and 1 1/2 inches high. I placed a 1/35 scale German figure in the pictures for scale comparison. The completed shelter could easily be used in a diorama or vignette setting without much work other than some scratch-built details and some weathering. This was a very easy item to assemble and took very little time to do so.\nThanks to Jís Work for the review sample. Please be sure to mention that you saw the kit reviewed here when ordering.\nAll in all this is a decent set of shelters. I was impressed with the detailing on such a simple item. With scratch-built tent poles and tent stakes it would be very easy to detail these shelters. I like the kit and I feel that anyone who purchases it will be pleased as well. I would have no hesitation to recommend this kit to others.","T-Shirts & Stuff\nVisit Olive-Drab.com's sister site for\nover 8,000 free military vehicle photos!\nPASGT Kevlar Helmet\nThe Kevlar PASGT helmet was first fielded to U.S. military units in the early 1980s. The helmet, available in five sizes, provides ballistic protection for the head from fragmenting munitions. It is a one piece structure composed of multiple layers of Kevlar 29 ballistic fibre and phenolic PVB resin.\nThe PASGT helmet came from research by the U.S. Army Natick Research Lab. Beginning in the early 1970's Natick was looking for lighter materials to reduce the weight of the Vietnam era flak jacket and the World War II M-1 Helmet a.k.a the \"steel pot\". They eventually decided that a Kevalr helmet and vest would provide increased protection at an equivalent, but not a reduced, weight. Kevlar vests and helmets were issued during the 1980s as the Personnel Armor System, Ground Troops (PASGT).\nPASGT Kevlar Helmet: Personal Armor System Ground Troops\nMany of the problems with the M-1 steel helmet had to do with the fact that it only came in one size. The Kevlar helmet is made in five sizes, including an XS (intended primarily for women) and an XL (rare, suitable only for men with a very large head). The unit weighs between 3.1 pounds (size XS) to 4.2 pounds (size XL).\nThe nylon webbing inside the Kevlar helmet is functional but not comfortable. There is a foam helmet insert, a \"comfort pad\" or \"donut\", used by most soldiers. The inner web suspension system, including a sweatband, is olive drab in color but outer components such as the chin strap or cover and cover band are issued in camouflage pattern cloth or camo-compatible colors such as olive drab or desert tan. The photo at top shows a camo cloth cover with an olive drab band and chinstrap. Unit patches and rank insignia are attached to the cover. Each helmet has its size molded into the unit and nomenclature, contract, NSN information printed near the inside rim.\nIn 2000, Army safety engineers tested whether the weight of the Kevlar helmet increased neck injuries or caused other problems in accidents. The evidence from real-world analysis shows that Kevlar helmets appear to protect against head injury, and are not necessarily associated with neck injuries in motor vehicle accidents.\nThe Kevlar helmet is fitted with expendable components: headband; chin strap; center webbing suspensions assembly and screws that can be individually replaced for maintenance. Each helmet is issued with an instruction booklet that includes a size chart and other data. The PASGT system has been subject to a number of modifications over its lifetime, including a newer lightweight version of the helmet shell and changes in the suspension system and straps. The photo at left is of the newer-style suspension.\nThe PASGT style helmet has been widely imitated and is now standard issue in many countries around the world.\nKevlar is a Dupont product, a manmade organic fiber that combines high strength with light weight.\nFind More Information on the Internet\nThere are many fine websites that have additional information on this topic, too many to list here and too many to keep up with as they come and go.

{"question":"Como estudiante de programación, me interesa entender las estructuras de datos. ¿Podrías explicar qué son las listas enlazadas y compararlas con los arrays en términos de ventajas y desventajas para diferentes operaciones?","answer":"A linked list is an abstract, dynamic data structure consisting of linked nodes, where each node contains data and a pointer to the next node. When comparing linked lists and arrays, each has distinct advantages. Linked lists excel at insertion operations - adding elements is easy since you only need to update pointers, without having to shift or re-index elements. This is especially advantageous when inserting at the front of the list, as arrays would require re-indexing all elements. Linked lists also offer dynamic sizing, allowing elements to be added without needing to pre-define the size or reallocate memory. On the other hand, arrays have the advantage of faster element access through indexing - you can directly access any element using an index, while with linked lists you must traverse from the beginning to reach a specific element. Arrays also tend to be faster for general element access operations. The choice between them depends on the specific use case - linked lists are better for frequent insertions/deletions, while arrays are preferable when random access and indexing are priorities.","context":["Linked lists in Ruby, part 1\nI’ve seen quite a few people thinking that linked lists are very tricky to understand and then to perform operations on them. What about data and pointer components? Why do we even need this data structure? As with many things, it might be scary to dive into an unknown concept. In order to understand more advanced variants of linked lists (like stacks and queues, which we’ll talk about in our future articles), we’ll have to take a look at the basics of their parent - please welcome a linked list!\nLinked list basics\nWhat’s the definition of a linked list? It’s an abstract, dynamic data structure that consists of linked nodes. Each node’s payload includes actual data (anything you can think of really) and a pointer to the next node. In this article we’ll look at singly-linked lists.\nUnlike arrays, the linked list has no “connections” between each element other than pointers. and unless we maintain these links at all times, there is no way to get to these “disconnected” nodes. Since we don’t maintain references to these nodes in our program, they get garbage collected by the Ruby interpreter.\nOK, how about some actual code?\nLet’s take a look at each class.\nFirst, we define our\nNode class. Each node has 2 attributes - its\nvalue (actual “thing” you want to store inside this node) and a pointer (this one will reference the\nnext node). Initially, each newly initialized node points to\nnil (nowhere). Why? That’s because we don’t know if we may want to add any new nodes in the future.\nOur linked list class has 1 public attribute and that is its\nhead. Don’t think about this particular attribute as of something special - it simply represents our current list of nodes. In our case, it’s a list of only 1 node.\nLinked list with one node? Strange and probably useless, so let’s add some more nodes. For that we’ll have to define a new instance method on the\nunshift instance method we create a new node. Then we point our new node’s\nnext pointer to the\nhead element, that is, to the previous list of linked nodes. We then redefine our\nhead as the one which includes the new node.\nThis is all it takes to add a new node at the front of our linked list. This operation has several advantages over the same operation performed on array:\nRuby doesn’t have to re-index your linked list every time you add a new element to its front. This is not a major concern if we just playing in irb and unshifting small arrays. But what if our array has 1 million elements in it? Each element will have to be shifted to the right and re-indexed. That’s much more work than we have to do with our linked list push operation.\nThis point is more relevant to more lower-level (relatively to Ruby) languages like C/C++ where you have to define the size of your array at the time of initialization. That is, if you initialized an array of size n and later you have n + 1 element that you want to add to it, you will have to create a new array of size n + 1 (or larger), copy your previous array to it and add your new element. Again, this involves more operations than we have to do with our linked lists - we create an empty linked list and then we add any number of elements to it at any time. Each of these elements is located somewhere (not necessarily adjacent memory locations) in our computer’s memory and it’s not a problem to add more elements - all we have to do is to point some other element in our linked list to this new element. That’s it!\nWhat if we want to remove an element from the “top” of our list? Not a problem!\nThat’s it! All we have to do is to dereference (cut all ties to the top element) the top node. As soon as Ruby interpreter notices that no other node points to that top element, it gets garbage collected and the memory it occupied becomes available again.\nHow about inserting an element at the end of the list?\nHere we use a temporary variable\nnode to store the list. Then, as long as the next node is not empty (the end of the list), we “jump” from node to node. At last, when we locate the last node in the list, we set its pointer to the new node.\nThat’s it for our introduction to linked lists in Ruby. As you can see, there is nothing magical about linked list and they tend to be useful in some cases, especially when you are working with data that has to be organized in a certain fashion.\nIn the next post we’ll discuss several more advanced operations on linked list: insertion at position, deletion at position / by value and linked list reversal. Stay tuned!","Data Structures/List Structures\nList Structures and Iterators\nWe have seen now two different data structures that allow us to store an ordered sequence of elements. However, they have two very different interfaces. The array allows us to use\nset-element() functions to access and change elements. The node chain requires us to use\nget-next() until we find the desired node, and then we can use\nset-value() to access and modify its value. Now, what if you've written some code, and you realize that you should have been using the other sequence data structure? You have to go through all of the code you've already written and change one set of accessor functions into another. What a pain! Fortunately, there is a way to localize this change into only one place: by using the List Abstract Data Type (ADT).\nThe iterator is another abstraction that encapsulates both access to a single element and incremental movement around the list. Its interface is very similar to the node interface presented in the introduction, but since it is an abstract type, different lists can implement it differently.\nThere are several other aspects of the List ADT's definition that need more explanation. First, notice that the\nget-end() operation returns an iterator that is \"one past the end\" of the list. This makes its implementation a little trickier, but allows you to write loops like:\nvar iter:List Iterator := list.get-begin() while(not iter.equal(list.get-end())) # Do stuff with the iterator iter.move-next() end while\nSecond, each operation gives a worst-case running time. Any implementation of the List ADT is guaranteed to be able to run these operation at least that fast. Most implementations will run most of the operations faster. For example, the node chain implementation of List can run\ninsert-after() in .\nThird, some of the operations say that they have a default implementation. This means that these operations can be implemented in terms of other, more primitive operations. They're included in the ADT so that certain implementations can implement them faster. For example, the default implementation of\nget-nth() runs in because it has to traverse all of the elements before the nth. Yet the array implementation of List can implement it in using its\nget-element() operation. The other default implementations are:\nabstract type List<item-type> method is-empty() return get-begin().equal(get-end()) end method method get-size():Integer var size:Integer := 0 var iter:List Iterator<item-type> := get-begin() while(not iter.equal(get-end())) size := size+1 iter.move-next() end while return size end method helper method find-nth(n:Integer):List Iterator<item-type> if n >= get-size() error \"The index is past the end of the list\" end if var iter:List Iterator<item-type> := get-begin() while(n > 0) iter.move-next() n := n-1 end while return iter end method method get-nth(n:Integer):item-type return find-nth(n).get-value() end method method set-nth(n:Integer, new-value:item-type) find-nth(n).set-value(new-value) end method end type\nOccasionally throughout this book we'll introduce an abbreviation that will allow us to write, and you to read, less pseudocode. For now, we'll introduce an easier way to compare iterators and a specialized loop for traversing sequences.\nInstead of using the\nequal() method to compare iterators, we'll overload the\n== operator. To be precise, the following two expressions are equivalent:\niter1.equal(iter2) iter1 == iter2\nSecond, we'll use the\nfor keyword to express list traversal. The following two blocks are equivalent:\nvar iter:List Iterator<item-type> := list.get-begin() while(not iter == list.get-end()) operations on iter iter.move-next() end while\nfor iter in list operations on iter end for\nIn order to actually use the List ADT, we need to write a concrete data type that implements its interface. There are two standard data types that naturally implement List: the node chain described in the Introduction, normally called a Singly Linked List; and an extension of the array type called a Vector, which automatically resizes itself to accommodate inserted nodes.\nSingly Linked List\ntype Singly Linked List<item-type> implements List<item-type>\nhead refers to the first node in the list. When it's null, the list is empty.\nInitially, the list is empty.\nconstructor() head := null end constructor method get-begin():Sll Iterator<item-type> return new Sll-Iterator(head) end method\nThe \"one past the end\" iterator is just a null node. To see why, think about what you get when you have an iterator for the last element in the list and you call\nmethod get-end():Sll Iterator<item-type> return new Sll-Iterator(null) end method method prepend(new-item:item-type) head = make-node(new-item, head) end method method insert-after(iter:Sll Iterator<item-type>, new-item:item-type) var new-node:Node<item-type> := make-node(new-item, iter.node().get-next()) iter.node.set-next(new-node) end method method remove-first() head = head.get-next() end method\nThis takes the node the iterator holds and makes it point to the node two nodes later.\nmethod remove-after(iter:Sll Iterator<item-type>) iter.node.set-next(iter.node.get-next().get-next()) end method end type\nIf we want to make\nget-size() be an operation, we can add an Integer data member that keeps track of the list's size at all times. Otherwise, the default implementation works fine.\nAn iterator for a singly linked list simply consists of a reference to a node.\ntype Sll Iterator<item-type> data node:Node<item-type> constructor(_node:Node<item-type>) node := _node end constructor\nMost of the operations just pass through to the node.\nmethod get-value():item-type return node.get-value() end method method set-value(new-value:item-type) node.set-value(new-value) end method method move-next() node := node.get-next() end method\nFor equality testing, we assume that the underlying system knows how to compare nodes for equality. In nearly all languages, this would be a pointer comparison.\nmethod equal(other-iter:List Iterator<item-type>):Boolean return node == other-iter.node end method end type\nLet's write the Vector's iterator first. It will make the Vector's implementation clearer.\ntype Vector Iterator<item-type> data array:Array<item-type> data index:Integer constructor(my_array:Array<item-type>, my_index:Integer) array := my_array index := my_index end constructor method get-value():item-type return array.get-element(index) end method method set-value(new-value:item-type) array.set-element(index, new-value) end method method move-next() index := index+1 end method method equal(other-iter:List Iterator<item-type>):Boolean return array==other-iter.array and index==other-iter.index end method end type\nWe implement the Vector in terms of the primitive Array data type. It is inefficient to always keep the array exactly the right size (think of how much resizing you'd have to do), so we store both a\nsize, the number of logical elements in the Vector, and a\ncapacity, the number of spaces in the array. The array's valid indices will always range from\ntype Vector<item-type> data array:Array<item-type> data size:Integer data capacity:Integer\nWe initialize the vector with a capacity of 10. Choosing 10 was fairly arbitrary. If we'd wanted to make it appear less arbitrary, we would have chosen a power of 2, and innocent readers like you would assume that there was some deep, binary-related reason for the choice.\nconstructor() array := create-array(0, 9) size := 0 capacity := 10 end constructor method get-begin():Vector-Iterator<item-type> return new Vector-Iterator(array, 0) end method\nThe end iterator has an index of\nsize. That's one more than the highest valid index.\nmethod get-end():List Iterator<item-type> return new Vector-Iterator(array, size) end method\nWe'll use this method to help us implement the insertion routines. After it is called, the\ncapacity of the array is guaranteed to be at least\nnew-capacity. A naive implementation would simply allocate a new array with exactly\nnew-capacity elements and copy the old array over. To see why this is inefficient, think what would happen if we started appending elements in a loop. Once we exceeded the original capacity, each new element would require us to copy the entire array. That's why this implementation at least doubles the size of the underlying array any time it needs to grow.\nhelper method ensure-capacity(new-capacity:Integer)\nIf the current capacity is already big enough, return quickly.\nif capacity >= new-capacity return end if\nNow, find the new capacity we'll need,\nvar allocated-capacity:Integer := max(capacity*2, new-capacity) var new-array:Array<item-type> := create-array(0, allocated-capacity - 1)\ncopy over the old array,\nfor i in 0..size-1 new-array.set-element(i, array.get-element(i)) end for\nand update the Vector's state.\narray := new-array capacity := allocated-capacity end method\nThis method uses a normally-illegal iterator, which refers to the item one before the start of the Vector, to trick\ninsert-after() into doing the right thing. By doing this, we avoid duplicating code.\nmethod prepend(new-item:item-type) insert-after(new Vector-Iterator(array, -1), new-item) end method\ninsert-after() needs to copy all of the elements between iter and the end of the Vector. This means that in general, it runs in time. However, in the special case where iter refers to the last element in the vector, we don't need to copy any elements to make room for the new one. An append operation can run in time, plus the time needed for the\nensure-capacity() will sometimes need to copy the whole array, which takes time. But much more often, it doesn't need to do anything at all.\nmethod insert-after(iter:Vector Iterator<item-type>, new-item:item-type) ensure-capacity(size+1)\nThis loop copies all of the elements in the vector into the spot one index up. We loop backwards in order to make room for each successive element just before we copy it.\nfor i in size-1 .. iter.index+1 step -1 array.set-element(i+1, array.get-element(i)) end for\nNow that there is an empty space in the middle of the array, we can put the new element there.\nAnd update the Vector's size.\nsize := size+1 end method\nAgain, cheats a little bit to avoid duplicate code.\nmethod remove-first() remove-after(new Vector-Iterator(array, -1)) end method\nremove-after needs to copy all of the elements between iter and the end of the Vector. So in general, it runs in time. But in the special case where iter refers to the last element in the vector, we can simply decrement the Vector's size, without copying any elements. A remove-last operation runs in time.\nmethod remove-after(iter:List Iterator<item-type>) for i in iter.index+1 .. size-2 array.set-element(i, array.get-element(i+1)) end for size := size-1 end method\nThis method has a default implementation, but we're already storing the size, so we can implement it in time, rather than the default's\nmethod get-size():Integer return size end method\nBecause an array allows constant-time access to elements, we can implement\nset-nth() in , rather than the default implementation's\nmethod get-nth(n:Integer):item-type return array.get-element(n) end method method set-nth(n:Integer, new-value:item-type) array.set-element(n, new-value) end method end type\nSometimes we want Data Structures/List Structuresto move backward in a list too.\nDoubly Linked List Implementation\nThe vector we've already seen has a perfectly adequate implementation to be a Bidirectional List. All we need to do is add the extra member functions to it and its iterator; the old ones don't have to change.\ntype Vector<item-type> ... # already-existing data and methods\nImplement this in terms of the original\ninsert-after() method. After that runs, we have to adjust iter's index so that it still refers to the same element.\nmethod insert(iter:Bidirectional List Iterator<item-type>, new-item:item-type) insert-after(new Vector-Iterator(iter.array, iter.index-1)) iter.move-next() end method\nAlso implement this on in terms of an old function. After\nremove-after() runs, the index will already be correct.\nmethod remove(iter:Bidirectional List Iterator<item-type>) remove-after(new Vector-Iterator(iter.array, iter.index-1)) end method end type\nIn order to choose the correct data structure for the job, we need to have some idea of what we're going to *do* with the data.\n- Do we know that we'll never have more than 100 pieces of data at any one time, or do we need to occasionally handle gigabytes of data ?\n- How will we read the data out ? Always in chronological order ? Always sorted by name ? Randomly accessed by record number ?\n- Will we always add/delete data to the end or to the beginning ? Or will we be doing a lot of insertions and deletions in the middle ?\nWe must strike a balance between the various requirements. If we need to frequently read data out in 3 different ways, pick a data structure that allows us to do all 3 things not-too-slowly. Don't pick some data structure that's unbearably slow for *one* way, no matter how blazingly fast it is for the other ways.\nOften the shortest, simplest programming solution for some task will use a linear (1D) array.\nIf we keep our data as an ADT, that makes it easier to temporarily switch to some other underlying data structure, and objectively measure whether it's faster or slower.\nAdvantages / Disadvantages\nFor the most part, an advantage of an array is a disadvantage of a linked-list, and vice versa.\n- Array Advantages (vs. Link-Lists)\n- Index - Fast access to every element in the array using an index , not so with linked list where elements in beginning must be traversed to your desired element.\n- Faster - In general, It is faster to access an element in an array than accessing an element in a linked-list.\n- Link-Lists Advantages (vs. Arrays)\n- Resize - Can easily resize the link-list by adding elements without affecting the majority of the other elements in the link-list.\n- Insertion - Can easily insert an element in the middle of a linked-list, (the element is created and then you code pointers to link this element to the other element(s) in the link-list).\nSide-note: - How to insert an element in the middle of an array. If an array is not full, you take all the elements after the spot or index in the array you want to insert, and move them forward by 1, then insert your element. If the array is already full and you want to insert an element, you would have to, in a sense, 'resize the array.' A new array would have to be made one size larger than the original array to insert your element, then all the elements of the original array are copied to the new array taking into consideration the spot or index to insert your element, then insert your element."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0ad63484-9a21-4ea5-b3b4-5409b226b62b>","<urn:uuid:7ee35170-5fae-4d0b-88ff-5f1bfd77a40d>"],"error":null}

A door is placed in the wall by using the laser to point to the door sides, top, and a point on the floor, which indicate the direction the door is placed in.\nIn contrast to laser scans, which create point clouds with millions of points – and information overload – the number of measurement points is managed according to what is assessed necessary for the project. A straight/vertical wall requires two points, a slanted wall 3 points, a circular wall three points – and combinations of these require additional measuring points depending on how many sub-surfaces are deemed necessary. – However, as the recipient of the BIM project most often wants a simple model in which small irregularities have been corrected, Flexijet4BIMm is the perfect match.\nWith Flexijet4BIMm, only the relevant elements are measured that you wish to use in the continued work in the BIM project. It is easy to exclude furnishings, parts of installations, curtains, messy desks, and light partitions etc. that are not important for the recipient. This is in marked contrast to point cloud scans, where the building must be cleared in advance to the level that is required for the scan.\nWith a point cloud scanning the result is only points, which can then be used to model the BIM-project. That is equivalent to half of a measurement with Flexijet4BIMm, as this also contains the modelling of BIM. With expert manning of Flexijet4BIMm, the relevant information and properties can be added to the building elements on site, so that they can be read in the rest of the BIM project’s lifetime.\nFlexijet4BIMm is therefore the fastest method for creating BIM, but only with the relevant measurement points and the information and properties that you want to add to the model.\nFFlexijet4BIMm is a simple system with tremendous value due to the speed with which measurements can be completed in the BIM project in one workflow. By consolidating registration and modelling for the same person on site, the model’s consistency is ensured, along with all relevant elements of the building, equipment, installations etc. becoming part of the BIM project, ready for the subsequent following sketching, design or operation.\nBIM Equity provides surveying registered with Flexijet4BIMm and modelled on the spot. The price depends on the size of the project, its complexity, level of detail and the quantity of building elements that need to be registered and classified, as well as the file format that the model is to be delivered in (IFC, PLN, RVT etc.).","Scanning hard-to-reach, overhead or “limited access” spaces has historically posed many challenges for those working in the construction sector. Stuart Cadge, from leading indoor mobile mapping specialist, GeoSLAM, explains how innovations in mobile mapping technology are paving the way for a new dawn in surveying.\nArchitects, project managers and surveyors are constantly under pressure to finish projects on time and within budget. Not surprising, considering that most contractors anticipate that up to 30% of their projects will be subject to costly delays. This issue is not limited to large-scale construction schemes, as similar constraints affect smaller building renovation projects too.\nBut creating a dynamic “digital twin” of a building’s features throughout a project’s lifecycle can help stakeholders remain up to date with a scheme’s progress, enable problems to be spotted early on, and speed up the decision-making process should alterations be required.\nOnce a 3D scan of an asset – whether complete or part-finished – has been conducted with a handheld, lightweight mobile mapping tool, project teams can generate highly detailed 3D models and 2D plans. These digital representations of a project can then be updated, re-scanned and interpreted at any stage in an asset’s lifecycle.\nNow, 3D mobile mapping technology has gone one step further. New mobile mapping tools use Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping (SLAM) technology, providing the ability to rapidly scan even difficult-to-reach places such as multi-level spaces, large multi-room hotels or enclosed basements.\nThe speed and non-evasive nature of mobile scanning also allows for the surveying of occupied premises, such as live construction sites, or in-use buildings surveyed for renovation or redevelopment.\nThe high ceilings in Turner Construction’s offices were problematic for traditional scanners\nThe model of the suspended ceiling voids\nConstruction projects routinely require a series of surveys and the subsequent creation of a model. One such recent example involves Turner Construction, the US-based global multinational construction services company which employs more than 5,200 people and completes 1,500 projects every year worth in the region of $10 bn.\nThe firm embarked on an extension project of its Atlanta, Georgia, office, and the latest mobile mapping tools offered a welcome alternative to traditional yet more cumbersome survey methods.\nBefore works were able to begin on site, the Turner Construction team needed to conduct a survey of the suspended ceiling voids. However, no previous 3D model of the space existed, and as a result, Turner was tasked with surveying the notoriously difficult space from scratch.\nDue to the building’s high ceilings and the limited space available in the void to manoeuvre equipment, traditional scanners would have struggled. However, thanks to the incorporation of SLAM technology, the Turner Construction team were able to put a GeoSLAM ZEB-REVO to use and complete a scan in just 10 minutes. Weighing just 1kg, the ZEB-REVO was deployed on an extendable pole into the ceiling void to capture scan data easily while overcoming the location’s relative inaccessibility.\nThe ZEB-REVO scanner completed the scan in a fraction of the time\nUnlike conventional methods of surveying, which can often take a great deal of time, the ZEB-REVO can be quickly and effortlessly moved without the need for time-consuming set-ups. It is also able to mitigate occlusions (object shadows), saving time on the overall modelling as the team already had a complete picture to work from – rather than having to interpolate between shadows that are usually seen in terrestrial scanning.\nIf traditional techniques had been used, it would have taken more than eight hours to complete the scan – 48 times longer than by using a ZEB-REVO. Added to that, surfaces had an average measurement accuracy to within two centimetres – more than sufficient for modelling the data in a BIM model.\nThe accuracy of the mobile data collected allowed for a full MEP layout to be built in just one working day, showing features all the way down to under four centimetres.\nTime and budget constraints will always pose challenges for those working on construction projects, regardless of their role or level of seniority. But, if the past few years have proven anything, it is those who choose to harness the latest digital technologies who will be rewarded with significant cost and time savings across the board."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:44976969-4649-406c-9507-31c556392472>","<urn:uuid:eb50ae4b-1494-4ac3-b8d5-94b1f1074356>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm researching French artists and their early struggles. Could you compare the challenges faced by Bernard Lorjou and Edgar Degas in their formative years as painters, considering their family backgrounds?","answer":"Bernard Lorjou and Edgar Degas had quite different early experiences as painters due to their contrasting family circumstances. Lorjou came from significant poverty and left home at age 13 to pursue painting in Paris, where he initially struggled before finding work as a draughtsman at a silk house. In contrast, Degas came from a moderately wealthy family, and his father actively encouraged his artistic talents, allowing him to turn his room into an artist's studio by age 18. Degas received formal education at prestigious institutions like Lycée Louis-le-Grand and École des Beaux-Arts, though he lost his mother at age 13. While both artists eventually achieved success, their paths there were shaped by their distinct social backgrounds - Lorjou having to work his way up through the silk industry, while Degas had the privilege of formal artistic education and family support from the start.","context":["By Rachel Vincent-Clarke, Communications and Collections Assistant, McGill Visual Arts Collection\nIn a room on the main floor of Birks building, the home of the School of Religious Studies, hangs a vibrant still life painting by French expressionist artist Bernard Lorjou (1908-1986). Le Buffet Rouge (Fig. 1), dated 1946-47, depicts an array of victuals and tableware loosely displayed on a bright crimson dresser – a grey water jug, a wooden spoon, two pears, a carp on a yellow porcelain plate, an opened bottle of wine, an empty wine glass, and a crumpled white tablecloth. These objects, juxtaposed over a rich blue, green and yellow background, are rendered prominent as a result of the seemingly deliberate absence of perspective in the work. The aesthetic appeal of Le Buffet Rouge is largely attributable to the flatness and colourfulness of its composition, but also to the curiously generous application of paint onto the canvas.\nAbout Bernard Lorjou\nBetter known in his native France than in Canada, Bernard Lorjou had an unusual upbringing. Born in Loire et Cher in 1908, on the advent of the First World War, he spent the first 13 years of his life in a significantly impoverished family before leaving for Paris to follow his already formed aspiration: to become a successful painter. His early years in the City of Lights proved to be particularly arduous. Eventually, though, he was hired as a draughtsman for a prestigious silk house led by businessman and artist François Duharne. There, he met his future wife Yvonne Mottet, a fellow artist and painter, and found tremendous success as a silk designer. His designs adorned the silhouettes of some of the world’s most prominent women and brought him enough of a comfortable income that he was eventually able to paint on a full-time basis. \nLorjou’s first exhibition of paintings took place in 1928 at the Salon des Indépendants in Paris. Already, his works demonstrated great freedom, both in terms of graphic expression and the handling of colours. While the influence of Courbet, Velasquez, and Goya appeared in his early paintings, as a result of his multiple travels to Spain, his chromatic audacity and choice of subjects brought a unique character to his work. Not unlike Henri Matisse, whom he also evidently admired and emulated (Fig. 2), Bernard Lorjou progressively established himself as a master of the expressive language of colour and drawing. His brush strokes bore the mark of a sensible and impulsive man who fiercely refused to conform with the aesthetic norms that dominated the constrained artistic milieu that constituted the School of Paris painters. His paintings were notably exhibited in France, Japan, and the United-States.\nA founding member of the group of young French painters l’Homme témoin, which fought to preserve figurative painting amidst the growing trend of abstraction of the first half of the twentieth century, Lorjou gained international recognition for the eccentric and fiery nature that translated into his work as well as for his combative spirit (Fig. 3). Indeed, his political advocacy was just as loud as his artistic production. Passionate about social justice, he was heavily involved in debates surrounding colonialism, racial segregation, poverty in France and various health diseases. With a final show in 1985, the year before his passing, he denounced the risk of an AIDS epidemic. In art as in life, Lorjou had strong convictions, very high regard for his practice, and very little concern for his detractors.\nLe Buffet Rouge and its history at McGill\nA gift of Hélène V. Rubin and alumni Lionel Rubin, who obtained three degrees from McGill – a Bachelor of Arts in 1930, a Masters of Arts in Economics and Political Science in 1931, and a Bachelor of Common Law in 1935 –, the painting came to the University in 1977 as “but a small token of [their] gratitude to McGill for its immeasurable contribution to our community and country”.\nLe Buffet Rouge was initially installed, quite fittingly with its title, in the dining salon of the Faculty Club. There, it witnessed countless dinners, banquets and special events, along with the inevitable animated discussions that come with such reunions. One can’t help but think Lorjou would have enjoyed these exchanges.\nAmong the many people who encountered the painting was, in 1986, a renowned art conservator by the name of Robin Ashton. He, like most viewers, was struck by the vividness of the work and intrigued by the strangely thick application of the paint onto the canvas. After contacting the Visual Arts Collection and conducting a meticulous examination of it, he established “that the work was painted on top of another painting which was probably a vertical composition”. This conclusion was based on the facts that the very thick patches of paint were often inconsistent with the general composition of the work and that different colours showed through the paint from underneath. The artist must have slathered layers and layers of paint in an attempt to eliminate all traces of the hues of his initial realisation. This is quite understandable as part of Lorjou’s trademark was the crispness of his colours.\nInevitably, the moment came where the work’s integrity was jeopardized due to buckling, as a result of the heavy paint. The preservation of the painting required conservation, for fear that it would become no longer exhibitable. The crucial process of restoring Le Buffet Rouge involved a lengthy stretching and relining and could not have been possible without the support of a generous donor who, in 2015, offered to cover the costs of the treatment.\nFollowing a careful conservation treatment by Legris Conservation, Le Buffet Rouge was returned to the Birks Common Room as the pièce de résistance, where it can still be admired today in all of its intriguing and colourful glory (Fig. 4).\n Shibanuma, Junko.

Apart from being a renowned painter and sculptor, Degas was also a prominent printmaker and draftsman. He is most famous for his works which depict dancers. Know more about the life, art and achievements of Edgar Degas through these 10 interesting facts.\n#1 He was primarily raised by his father as his mother died when he was 13\nBorn Hilaire-Germain-Edgar De Gas on 19 July 1834 in Paris, France, Edgar was the eldest of five children of Augustin De Gas, a banker, and Celestine Musson De Gas. His family was moderately wealthy and at the age of 11, Edgar was enrolled in Lycée Louis-le-Grand, one of the leading schools not only in Paris but in entire France. Edgar lost his mother when he was 13. His father encouraged his artistic talents and by the time Edgar was 18, he had turned his room at his house into an artist’s studio.\n#2 The Bellelli Family is considered his early masterpiece\nIn 1855, at the age of 20, Degas joined the École des Beaux-Arts, an influential art school in Paris. However the following year he abandoned his studies in Paris and traveled to Italy, where for the next three years he became engrossed in painting and sculpture. Here Degas made numerous rapid pencil copies of the works of artists he admired including Giotto, Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and Titian. Also, while living in Italy with his aunt Laura and her husband Gennaro Bellelli, Degas began work on his painting The Bellelli Family. Completed in 1867, the portrait is considered the greatest masterpiece of his early years.\n#3 His greatest inspirations were Ingres and Delacroix\nThe two artists whose works had the deepest influence on Degas were Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres and Eugene Delacroix. Ingres was a champion of line whose work is marked by clarity of outline and carefully modeled form. Delacroix was his chief rival and was known for his emphasis on color and movement. Edgar Degas’ reverence for two opposing styles of the time led to his masterpieces of later years which were vigorously drawn, captured movement like never before and were brilliantly colored.\n#4 A Cotton Office in New Orleans brought him fame and financial success\nThe early works of Degas were history paintings like the famous Young Spartans Exercising; and portraits depicting family members. Among his paintings of family members was A Cotton Office in New Orleans, which was his only work purchased by a museum during his life. The painting was a turning point in his career bringing him recognition and financial stability. By late 1860s, Degas moved from history to scenes of contemporary life. His paintings of this period include his famous depictions of horses and their riders. Also depictions of women started to become his most favored subject.\n#5 Degas is most famous for his paintings which depict dancers\nEdgar Degas was a regular visitor of the old Paris Opera House and was even allowed access to the dance classes as he was a friend of Jules Perrot, the famous ballet master. From the 1870s till his death, Degas continuously explored the subject of dance which accounts for a large portion of his work. He is most famous for his paintings of ballerinas, at work, in rehearsal or at rest. He depicted them from various angles in hundreds of different positions. Degas captured movement like never before which is one of the reasons of the legendary status of his dance paintings.\n#6 Edgar Degas is considered as one of the founders of the art movement Impressionism\nThe art movement Impressionism, which among other things is characterized by accurate depiction of light, candid poses and vivid colors, emerged in France in the 1870s. Edgar Degas joined the art group which would later emerge as the Impressionists. He exhibited his work in several Impressionist Exhibitions. Degas however disliked the term Impressionist and later distanced himself from the movement. Unlike Impressionists, his paintings were not spontaneous and Degas ridiculed their practice of painting outside. Nonetheless his work can more accurately be associated with Impressionism than any other art movement and Edgar Degas is considered as one of the founders of the movement.\n#7 His most famous painting is L’Absinthe\nThe most famous painting by Edgar Degas is L’Absinthe (The Absinthe Drinker), which is considered a masterful representation of the isolation in Paris during its rapid growth. Apart from his paintings, Edgar Degas is famous for his drawings and sculptures. Degas is known as a superb draftsman. He also created numerous sculptures during a span of four decades. However his only sculpture that was exhibited during his lifetime was Little Dancer of Fourteen Years. Originally sculpted in wax and around two-thirds life size, it is one of his most famous works in any media.\n#8 Degas sided with “anti-Dreyfusards” during the Dreyfus Affair\nIn the mid-1890s France was gripped with one of the tensest political dramas in its history known as the Dreyfus Affair. Involving an officer of Jewish background named Alfred Dreyfus it divided French society into two sections. Edgar Degas sided with the “anti-Dreyfusards”. His antisemitism alienated him from many of his friends. In his last years, Degas was troubled with eye problems, had to wear dark glasses outdoors and quit work in 1912. Edgar Degas died in Paris on September 27, 1917. He was 83 years old. Degas never married. He did have close relationships with several females, most prominently American painter Mary Cassatt.\n#9 He is considered a misogynist by several critics\nDegas made a series of drawings which showed naked women in awkward poses while drying themselves with towels, combing their hair, bathing etc. This series is among his works which have since been denounced by several critics as misogynist. Also Degas infamously referred to the dancers he drew as his “little monkey girls” and said that “I have perhaps too often considered woman as an animal.” His misogynist and anti-Semitic views have somewhat marred his legacy.\n#10 Degas is credited with combining Classicism with Impressionism\nMany unseen artworks of Edgar Degas were exhibited after his death enhancing his artistic reputation not only as a painter but also in the fields of drawing, printmaking and sculpture. Today Degas is considered a pioneer of the Impressionism movement. He is credited with combining the Classical methods which he mastered early on with Impressionistic sensibilities thus giving rise to brilliant artworks which were a source of inspiration for future generations of artists."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:658faefb-dca4-4428-906b-a8fc0b6d5c03>","<urn:uuid:762d8976-a644-45ba-bc14-141d3f40f763>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does the physical process of coffee extraction work in relation to particle sizes, and what tools can help measure and control this process?","answer":"Coffee extraction occurs in three main phases: wetting (where particles absorb water and release gases), extraction (where solubles dissolve into water), and hydrolysis (where larger carbohydrates break down into soluble ones). The KRUVE Sifter helps control this process by separating grounds into uniform sizes using sieves ranging from 200 µm (espresso) to 1,000 µm (french press). This uniformity is crucial because particle size directly affects extraction time - smaller particles extract quickly while larger ones require more time for water to penetrate and dissolve solubles. Of the coffee bean's content, 28% is water-soluble, containing various compounds including fruit acids (which dissolve first), sugars (which dissolve next), and bitter plant solids (which dissolve last). By controlling particle size through proper sifting and grinder calibration, brewers can better manage the extraction process to achieve optimal flavor profiles.","context":["Do you know if your coffee grinder is doing its job properly? Can you ascertain the quality of your coffee grinds, whether by touch, sifting the grounds through your fingers, or simply by sight? Are the ground particles uniform in size, allowing for the best extraction? In short, is your grinder helping you make the best cup of coffee you can brew?\nIf your answer falls anywhere on a scale of “No idea” to “What the heck are you talking about?” then the KRUVE Sifter Twelve is the tool for you.\nThe KRUVE Sifter is a compact device for determining the optimal size of ground coffee for every brewing method. Anyone who takes their coffee seriously can benefit from sifting coffee grinds with the KRUVE Sifter.\nThe KRUVE Sifter’s components are a two-tiered set of triangularly-shaped compartments. A set of 12 sieves comes in micron densities from 200 µm (the neighborhood for espresso) to 1,000 µm (french press territory). The photo-etched metal sieves snap snugly into place in two of the compartments, which are housed between a bottom tray and a lid on top. The KRUVE Sifter kit also comes with a bamboo sieve holder to keep everything organized.\nOnce assembled, the KRUVE Sifter sifts coffee grinds into particles of uniform size. Simply grind 50 grams of whole roasted coffee beans, dump the grinds into the top compartment of the KRUVE Sifter, then gently shake the KRUVE Sifter for about a minute. Boulders—the oversize and chaffy bits—will remain in the top compartment, and the dusty particles (aka super fines) will separate into the bottom tray.\nThe middle compartment is where the coffee grinds of uniform size can be found. Ideally, the yield in this sweet spot should be about 80 percent. When this distribution is achieved through sifting, you know your grinder is calibrated correctly and you can proceed to pour-over, drip, espresso, or any brewing method in between—Chemex, AeroPress, Ratio—in full confidence that your grind size is dialed in for optimal extraction.\nThe KRUVE Sifter, which is available in silver (as shown) and a matte black finish, is a valuable tool for anyone who wants to explore the variables that factor into creating the perfect cup of coffee. Sifting is an extra step worth taking to optimize grinder performance, as well as; much like a scale, objectively measuring particle size profiles for the desired extraction.\nThe KRUVE Sifter has applications for coffee professionals, too. It has obvious appeal for baristas of all levels, from those who are just beginning to learn the craft, to those who are throwing down in latte art competitions. In fact, several international barista champions have used the KRUVE Sifter along their path to victory.\nFor those who want to fine-tune their process that much more, KRUVE also sells an expansion pack with 15 sieves, from 200–1,600 µm). As a tool designed specifically for coffee the KRUVE Sifter helps establish a visual and tactile baseline for proper grind size, and aids in the understanding of extraction, while showing the importance of grinder calibration.","“Extraction is a measure of the solubles yield. It is also expressed as a percentage, comparing the amount of coffee flavoring material in the beverage to the amount of coffee grounds used to prepare the beverage. Approximately 28% of the organic and inorganic matter matter contained in roasted coffee beans will readily dissolve in water. The remaining 72% is cellulose bean fiber that isn’t water soluble under normal brewing conditions.”\n— Ted Lingle, The Coffee Brewing Handbook, 2011 Specialty Coffee Association of America.\nWhen we talk about extraction, we are evaluating the process in which particles dissolve from the ground coffee into the water. Roasted coffee is a wonderfully complex thing. Though only 28% of every coffee bean can dissolve in water, that 28% represents 800-1000 different flavor compounds, half of them aromatic gasses, and half of them soluble solids. It’s much, much harder to track what gasses we’ve pulled from the ground coffee into the brewed coffee, so we’re usually more concerned about the coffee solids we’ve dissolved: what are they, and how much of them have we dissolved?\nIt’s pretty easy to break up the soluble material in coffee into four basic categories: fruit acids, which come from the fruit itself; fruit sugars, which are also derived from the coffee fruit; caramelized sugars, which develop during the roasting process; and bitter, dry plant solids. Acids dissolve pretty easily, sugars take longer to dissolve, and those bitter, dry plant solids are pretty dense and are made up of large molecules that take the longest to dissolve. Because these all dissolve in the same order, when we calculate an extraction yield as 15%, 21%, or 25% of the total soluble material, we can usually assume a certain concentration of those four main categories of coffee solids. From 0-18%, we’re seeing the fruit acids dissolving in high concentrations. From 18-22%, the fruit sugars and caramelized sugars start dissolving in higher concentrations, and from 22% to 28%, we see the dry, bitter plant solids dissolving in higher concentrations. Therefore, ideally, we’d like coffee extraction yield readings to land around 19-21% for the sweetest brewed expression of what that coffee has to offer.\nThe extraction yield is just an average though — anytime you’re brewing coffee, the smaller particles will dissolve quicker, and the larger particles will dissolve slower. So in a 19% extraction yield, we’re assuming the larger particles might only be extracted to 17%, while the smaller particles maybe would have extraction to 21%. The more consistently even your grind setting, the more consistent your extraction yield will be. This is the main crux for the importance of not only just using a burr grinder, but a quality, precision burr grinder.\nThe reason for this disparate extraction yield has to do with how the coffee actually extracts. There are three main phases: Wetting, in which the coffee particles absorb water and push the remaining gasses out; Extraction, in which the solubles inside the particles actually begin dissolve into the water and start exiting the coffee particle into the overall solution; and Hydrolysis, in which larger insoluble carbohydrates are broken down into soluble ones. With smaller coffee particles, the water can penetrate and dissolve the solubles very quickly. Larger coffee particles require the water to penetrate deeper, and have more solubles to extract, so it takes longer inside the particle to dissolve the desired solids before the brew leaves the particle to join the overall brewed coffee solution.\nIt’s because of this relationship between brew time and particle size that we are able to control our coffee brewing process more specifically. When paired with an appropriate ratio of coffee to water, a brew temperature around 200ºF, and controlled agitation, extracting the positive flavor solids and leaving the negative ones behind becomes an easy solution. (Please forgive the pun)."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:96c0db4a-9fe4-498e-a5c2-7a1d0f2c0cc3>","<urn:uuid:f4e870ba-bd4a-4934-bf92-bb6422206d89>"],"error":null}

Fill the pastry case with a round of baking paper and add baking beans (see tip) to weigh it down. Bake for 15 mins, then carefully remove the paper and beans and cook the pastry for 5 mins more (this is called baking blind).\nWhat happens if you don’t blind bake pastry?\nBaking blind is a method of cooking the pastry of a quiche, pie or tart BEFORE you add the filling – otherwise, the theory goes, the pastry doesn’t cook, while the filling does and you end up with a soggy mess.\nWhat happens if you dont blind bake pie crust?\nRecipes for most tarts, pies and quiches call for pre-baking to ensure that the final product doesn’t end up soggy. Pre-baking also prevents you from ending up with undercooked shells or undercooked fillings. For no-bake pie recipes, you definitely need to pre-bake, or else you’ll wind up with an all-around goopy bite.\nHow do you blind bake pastry without baking paper?\nThe absolute best option for blind-baking is a tempered-glass or aluminum pie plate. Aluminum or tempered glass will keep your crust crisp and shapely.\nHow long does Jus Rol shortcrust pastry take to cook?\n7 Brush each pastry with egg and arrange on the baking tray. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and crisps.\nHow do you use ready made pastry sheets?\nYou can use the entire sheet of puff to make a big tart, shape smaller individual tarts, or even bake the puff inside muffin cups and fill them later. Bake the pastries at 425°F until puffed: Bake just until you see them puff up and just start to brown, roughly 10 minutes.\nDoes ready rolled pastry go off?\nReady rolled pastry will go mouldy when it is past its best (I know from past experience!). Therefore, as long as it looked fine I don’t think there should be a problem."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:33c9d96b-cdaa-47eb-89f0-19f09629e77f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How did the Berlin Wall's construction affect daily life on Bernauer Strasse, and what were its broader impacts on East German society?","answer":"On Bernauer Strasse, the wall's construction dramatically divided the street, with the border running along building facades on the Soviet side. Residents in these buildings were forcibly evicted, their windows and doors bricked up after some used them to escape. The Church of Reconciliation, caught in the 'death strip,' was ultimately demolished in 1985. On a broader scale, the wall was built to stop the mass exodus from East Germany - before its construction in 1961, about 3.5 million East Germans had fled to the West, mostly through Berlin. The wall effectively imprisoned East Germans in their own country, though it 'failed to imprison their spirit.' East Germany could not provide its people with political freedom or economic prosperity, leading to this crisis of legitimacy that ultimately required the wall's construction to prevent complete collapse.","context":["By Nicholas Dima l December 10, 2009\nPresident Reagan speaks in Berlin at the Brandenburg Gate – June 12, 1987\nFor several decades the Berlin Wall was the emblematic symbol of a world divided. On the one hand there was the communist camp with its imprisoned people and on the other the West with its own problems, but free and democratic. Hundreds of years ago, China had also built a wall but to keep the barbarian invaders out. The communists built the wall to keep in their own people. Indeed, if the Berlin Wall and the barbed wire that surrounded the entire communist world had not existed, a great many people would have fled their countries. In the heart of Europe the Berlin Wall kept communism in control, but it could not guarantee its survival. And the human toll caused by those regimes that relied on walls, barbed wire and force was enormous. Hundreds of people were killed during their attempts to escape to freedom; thousands were imprisoned; hundreds of thousands died behind the Iron Curtain. A few fortunate men survived the ordeal and managed to tell their stories. Among them is this author, who was caught at the Romanian-Yugoslav border in the 1950’s and who subsequently spent three and a half years in communist prisons and labor camps. However, questions remain. Why was the Berlin Wall built and why did it come down so suddenly almost three decades later? What lessons can we learn from the Wall now 20 years after its demise?\nWorld War II was essentially caused by two fanatical ideologies – Nazism and Communism. The United States entered the war after Japan attacked Pearl Harbor, fought the Axis forces alongside the Western Allies, and won the war. Inadvertently, however, the war also helped the rise of the Soviet Union and its communist camp. Soon thereafter a cold war ensued between the two remaining superpowers; this war consumed an extraordinary number of human lives and a tremendous amount of material resources. Communism threatened the entire world with tyranny and nuclear destruction and only a strong American commitment to freedom and democracy saved the West.\nFor over four decades the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) confronted each other head-on in post-World War II Germany. Berlin became the capital of East Germany, but it was a city divided. Driven by ideology and controlled by Moscow, East Germany, misleadingly called the German Democratic Republic (DDR), could not offer its people either political freedom or economic prosperity. Hundreds of thousands of East Germans fled and left everything behind crossing into the West. East Germany risked losing its population and legitimacy and was faced with the specter of collapse. These reasons convinced Moscow and East Berlin that the only way to keep their people in was to imprison them at the point of a gun behind a highly guarded wall. As a result, the Berlin Wall was erected in 1961 and became a worldwide symbol of communist oppression.\nWhile the Soviet Union was seeking global expansion, America resorted to containment. This policy worked in Western Europe for over four decades. However, Eastern Europe became a prison of nations that never accepted their fate. The Berlin Wall separated two vastly different worlds and became such a fixture that many people thought it would be there forever. Personally, I had a hard time convincing my student-officers at the U.S. Army John F. Kennedy Special Warfare Center and School (SWCS) at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, that nothing lasts forever and that one day even the Berlin Wall would be obsolete. Indeed, economic, technological, ethno-demographic and socio-political forces conspired from within and from without to finally bring down the wall.\nFacts and Figures\nThe Berlin Wall was a concrete barrier built to enclose the West Berlin enclave completely and to separate it from East Berlin. This wall ran 96 miles in length surrounding West Berlin. At the end of World War II, Berlin was divided among the Soviet zone and the three Western zones – American, British and French – which later unified as West Berlin. Shortly after the Cold War started, Berlin became one of the major Soviet-American flash points. Between June 1948 and May 1949, for example, the Soviets blockaded the city hoping to eventually bring it to its knees and ultimately under their control. Only America’s determination and the Berlin airlift it organized to provision the city saved it from Soviet domination. However, Berlin was the main portal for East Germans to flee their country. Before the Berlin Wall was constructed about 3.5 million East Germans escaped to the West and the majority of them escaped through West Berlin. The only way the communist authorities could keep people inside was to contain them within a wall. In addition to the infamous Berlin Wall, East Germany surrounded itself with a long and dreaded wall that extended through its entire border with West Germany.\nThe Berlin Wall included watch towers placed along large concrete walls, an inner forbidden and mined zone known as the “death strip,” anti-vehicle trenches, and other deadly defenses. Yet, against such odds, during its existence from 1961 to 1989 around 5,000 people attempted to escape over and under the Wall. Most of them were arrested, some managed to cross it, and between 100 and 200 were killed trying to escape to freedom. The Berlin Wall succeeded in making the German people prisoners in their own country, but it failed to imprison their spirit.\nBy the late 1980s, the Soviet bloc was economically and morally bankrupt and Moscow was confronted with a huge dilemma: Either attempt to again suppress the revolutionary movements that were sweeping Eastern Europe and risk the implosion of the system from within, or let communism go and adjust to a new era. International circumstances and dire internal conditions made the last Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev (1985-1991), opt for Glasnost (openness in government) and Perestroika (restructuring government), and a few years later, on December 31, 1991, the Soviet Union collapsed.\nIn the end, Soviet communism was brought down by its own failures, by the masses who rejected their system of brutality and corruption, and by the American determination to oppose and defeat it. Many world leaders, from the West and the East, contributed to the USSR’s demise. No one can forget Poland’s Solidarity movement and its leader Lech Walesa. Nobody could ignore the contribution of such dissidents as Vaclav Havel of the former Czechoslovakia. And no one can forget the paramount contributions of Pope John Paul II, himself from Poland, and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. From a moral and political point of view, one great Western leader, the former American president, Ronald Reagan, stands out. It is difficult to imagine the defeat of Soviet communism without the crusading zeal and support of President Reagan.\nRonald Reagan and the Berlin Wall\nThe former conservative Republican President of the United States was a true believer of liberty and freedom and fully understood the communist system and disdained it unreservedly. Looking back, it appears that Reagan had set as a priority for his life to bring down the Soviet communist system. He demanded the dismantling of the Berlin Wall on several occasions prior to becoming president. Having visited Berlin in November 1978, he saw for himself the dreaded Berlin Wall and the ‘death strip’ on the communist side. He even visited East Berlin and convinced himself once more of the immorality and injustice of such a barrier to freedom. According to the American Spectator of December 2009, on that occasion he declared to his entourage: “We’ve got to find a way to knock this thing down.” Bringing down Soviet communism and the Berlin Wall truly became a crusade for the future president. Actually, author Paul Kengor dedicated many pages of his book, Crusader – Ronald Reagan and the Fall of Communism, to Reagan’s tireless efforts to bring down the Wall. Reagan’s intent was clear, writes Kengor. He wanted “an end to totalitarianism and the liberation of the communist peoples.”\nDuring the years of uncertainty before the collapse of communism, when Moscow still hoped to save the Soviet regime and keep Eastern Europe under its control, it was President Reagan who stood fast and vehemently condemned the Soviet Union as the “evil empire.” Standing within feet of the Wall by the Brandenburg Gate, while visiting West Berlin on June 12, 1987, Mr. Reagan declared with conviction: “There is one sign the Soviets can make that would be unmistakable, that would advance dramatically the cause of freedom and peace,” and then he addressed the Soviet leader personally: “General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, if you seek liberalization, come here to this gate. Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate. Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!”\nThe Soviet leader, however, did not rush to tear the Wall down, but he, the Soviet empire, and the entire world paid attention to President Reagan’s words. Gradually, with the domino-like collapse of the Soviet satellites and the increasing demonstrations for reform in East Germany, Moscow finally conceded and the fate of the dreaded Berlin Wall was sealed. The demolition of the Wall began to happen on November 9, 1989 just after weeks of civil unrest. Unable to control the people anymore and without Moscow’s support, the East German government announced that all its citizens could freely visit West Germany and West Berlin. Immediately, thousands of people crossed into the West and began to chip at the Wall and eventually to tear it down. Less than a year later, on October 3, 1990, reunification took place and East Germany ceased to exist. Today only a few remaining sections of the Berlin Wall remain standing mostly as an art object and as a reminder of the very dark past.\nAnniversary and Consequences\nThe 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall was celebrated in 2009 with special events and public rallies. The celebrations climaxed on the date of the anniversary, November 9th, with a grand party at the historic Brandenburg Gate. In 1989 the imposing gate that had been a symbol of separation for all those Cold War years became an emblem of union for a new nation in a new era. Among the participating leaders were the German Chancellor Angela Merkel, herself from the eastern part of the country, former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and leaders of all 27 European Union countries. In her speech and as reported by the Associated Press, Chancellor Merkel declared: “Freedom is not self evident. Freedom must be fought for. Freedom must be defended time and again.” Indeed, freedom is both an end and a process that must be continuously nourished and defended. And what does the fall of the Berlin Wall mean 20 years later for the present and future generation of Europeans?\nThe tearing down of the Berlin Wall and the collapse of Soviet communism in Eastern Europe were days of euphoric joy and exuberant expectations. The passage of time, however, has tempered the enthusiasm and has brought about a degree of cynicism. Nevertheless, the balance sheet is positive. There is freedom now in most East European countries; freedom of expression, freedom of movement, freedom of religion. There is also democracy, but a peculiar kind of democracy. Unfortunately, many of the former communists have robbed the wealth of their countries and used their new found freedom and democracy for the advancement of their own interests. The oligarchs of Russia are a good example. While a certain segment of the population enjoys the fruits of freedom, a larger segment of the population has been marginalized and continues to be stuck in poverty. Equal opportunity, the rule of law and free market principles elude them. In this regard, a disappointed Muscovite woman who has been through this entire change made a saddening statement: “The children of our former masters are now the masters of our children.” The East European societies are now more polarized than ever with another small but different elite in control of various state capitalist systems. These nouveau rich made up overwhelmingly of the former Communist Party nomenklatura and secret police officers are now multimillionaires and a few are even billionaires in control of vast natural resources. At the same time, their countries are indebted scores of billions of dollars, some of them owing more than their national GDPs.\nGeopolitically, the paradigm shift has been dramatic, but some old interests have remained. Russia, for example, has renounced her old global aspirations, but is stubbornly clinging to new regional ambitions. Thus, Moscow aggressively seeks to carve out its sphere of influence in areas of the former Soviet Union such as the Caucasus, Ukraine, and in other regions as well. On the other hand, many former Soviet satellites have sought security under the NATO umbrella and within the European Union, which in turn has sought enlargement from the Atlantic Ocean to the Baltic and Black Seas. But these newly integrated countries look again more like satellites than equal partners. In addition, they are losing their sovereignty to a far away ideological bureaucracy in Brussels. Many new and old EU members are complaining about this situation. Recently, for example, the Czech President, Vaclav Klaus a Eurosceptic, only reluctantly endorsed the Lisbon Treaty stating: “I cannot agree with its contents because once the Lisbon Treaty will come into effect, the Czech Republic will cease to be a sovereign state.” The Lisbon Treaty amended the previous EU founding treaties, the two Treaties of Rome (1957) and the Maastricht Treaty (1993), to complete the economic and political integration of Europe.\nOn the other hand, it appears that while Moscow renounced communism, the European Union has embraced socialism. In fact, the very man who reigned over the fall of the Berlin Wall, Mikhail Gorbachev, described the EU as “the new European Soviet.” And the renowned Russian dissident Vladimir Bukovsky took the idea one step further and observed that “the EU is the old Soviet model, presented in Western guise.” In what direction is the European Union now marching? Unfortunately, America itself seems to be drifting these days and instead of being an active player in European affairs it seems to be more and more a spectator. The Berlin Wall and the old Iron Curtain are gone, but democracy, freedom, and prosperity must indeed be nurtured and “defended time and again.”\nNicholas Dima, Ph.D., is a former professor and author of numerous books and articles including the autobiographical memoir, Journey to Freedom, a description of the effects of communist dictatorship on a nation, a family and an individual. (Refer to updated editions). He is currently a contributor to","Anyone interested in finding out what life was like living with the Berlin Wall should come to Bernauer Strasse. The street was right on the dividing line between East and West and is now part of the Berlin Wall Memorial, an open-air exhibition (if that’s the right word) which includes a Memorial, Reconciliation Church, Documentation Centre and 80 metres of the Wall.\nBefore the end of World War II, the whole length of Bernauer Strasse, was the border line between the districts of Wedding and Mitte, and consequently when the city was carved up by the victors at the end of the war, the street became part of the border between East and West Berlin.\nAlthough Wedding found itself in the Western French sector and Mitte in the Eastern Soviet sector, there was no physical barrier between the two, and people were free to travel anywhere within the city. There was however, a vast difference between how people lived in their respective sectors. The Western side of the city was not only more affluent, but it also had luxury shops, restaurants and entertainment venues for people to spend their money in – and East Berliners wanted to spend what cash they had in West Berlin; and as time went on, a steady trickle of people started to leave East Berlin for a better life across the border.\nThe 1945 Potsdam Agreement had left Berlin wholly located within the German Democratic Republic (GDR) and once people were in West Berlin, they could then travel out of the city – and out of the Eastern Bloc. The trickle of people from East to West turned into a flood and by 1961 it was reckoned that more than 3 million East Germans had left the GDR via Berlin.\nTo stop this hemorrhaging of people to the West, the GDR authorities decided to build a physical barrier, a barrier which over time became more and more difficult to penetrate – and there was no better example of how the Berlin Wall divided the city than Bernauer Strasse.\nBernauer Strasse was just an ordinary residential road lined with tenement buildings on both sides of the street, but the East/West border line didn’t run down through the middle, instead, it went right up to the front doors of the houses on the southern, Soviet side, leaving the rest of the street in the French sector.\nOn August 13th 1961, work started on constructing the Berlin Wall, which effectively meant that the buildings on the Soviet side of the street became part of the same physical barrier. The doors were locked shut, but those eager to flee East Berlin started using the upstairs windows to escape. The GDR authorities responded by forcing the residents out and then bricking up the windows and doors, but not before hundreds had escaped, although inevitably, some died trying. Below is a short film clip that shows these events unfolding.\nWith fewer opportunities to escape above-ground, people began to tunnel their way under the street: The largest tunnel was 12 metres deep and 145 metres long. For 2 days and nights between October 3rd-5th 1964, fifty-seven people managed to escape under Bernauer Strasse, but on the third night their secret was discovered by GDR border guards.\nBy 1965 most of the buildings on the Soviet side of the street had been torn down, although some of them were left with just their lower façades and were incorporated into the wall.\nThe archive pictures below show one of the tunnels (tunnel 29), and what was left of some of the apartments that were used as part of the wall.\nThe barricade divided the city for 28 years, and it was while the population were having a weekend lie-in on the night of the 13th August 1961 that GDR troops began closing off streets and erecting barbed-wire fences. Two days later, large square concrete blocks were added to make the barrier more permanent.\n‘Improvements’ were made in 1962, 1965 and 1975, and ultimately became a series of obstacles between two walls with a ‘Death Strip’ in between. At Bernauer Strasse the Church of Reconciliation found itself slap bang in the middle of the Death Strip, and so in 1985, to make life easier, GDR border troops blew it up.\nThis video by Trabinator shows the church before and during the demolition.\nNevertheless, more than 5,000 people succeeded, one way or another, in making it across to the West by the time the wall came down. Approximately 3,200 were caught trying however, and given stiff jail sentences, but well over a hundred people were killed in the attempt.\nThe four-minute video below shows some of these escapes and JFK’s famous “ich bin ein Berliner” (I am a Berliner) speech in June 1963.\nYou can find out everything you need to know about the Berlin Wall at the Berlin Wall Memorial Visitor Centre on the corner of Gartenstrasse and Bernauer Strasse. To get there I took the S Bahn to Nordbahnhof which also happens to be part of the Berlin Wall memorial site and includes an exhibition about Ghost Stations.\nThe city wasn’t only divided above ground, it was also divided beneath it as well, and Nordbahnhof was one of these Ghost Stations that was manned by armed guards to prevent trains from West Berlin stopping, and East German people escaping.\nThe Visitor Centre is the rusty-looking building at the intersection close to the station, and was my first port of call – and it should be yours too – but firstly, a word of warning: The memorial site is almost a mile long, and I only covered the first section, which still took me half a day, so you need to factor this into your schedule before starting out.\nApart from providing information, the Visitor Centre also has a film about the wall and a bookshop that I came back to in fear of spending too much time here instead of the Memorial.\nThe Visitor Centre is located in what used to be the West, so you need to walk across the road to visit the Memorial site. The whole area is divided into 4 sections and was an ongoing project when I came here in 2013. As I mentioned, I only covered Section A, mainly because this section was the most important section to see at the time, and probably still is.\nSection A is sub-titled ‘The Wall and the Death strip’ which will give you some idea on what to expect. It doesn’t attempt to recreate the original border, but is left as it was when the wall fell in November 1989, but in a respectful way.\nThe gallery below shows four aspects of the wall – 1) The wall as seen from the street (western) side, 2) the wall from the Memorial side, 3) The old Inner wall and 4) some dismantled segments.\nAs you might imagine, there are plenty of information boards explaining everything, and in the centre of the strip is the Window of Remembrance showing the pictures of some of the 136 people who lost their lives trying to escape.\nTowards the top end of the strip there’s a gap in the wall in order for you to make your way back across the road to the Documentation Centre. The main reason most people come here is to climb the steps up to the viewing platform for a bird’s eye view of the Death strip and Watchtower below (see featured pic at top of page)\nBy walking back across the road to Ackerstrasse you can enter an area that will allow you to peer into – but not enter – the Death Strip from behind the Inner Wall. The watchtower incidentally was originally positioned elsewhere and re-assembled here in 2009. At one point there were five of these watchtowers along Bernauer Strasse.\nThis was where I ended my tour of the Wall Memorial, but across Ackerstrasse is Section B and the Chapel of Reconciliation where the original church used to be. I think it’s worth pointing out though that not everybody wanted this reminder left behind, and it’s understandable in a way because it’s still fresh in people’s memory; but for the rest of us, this is without doubt the best place to come and get an insight into what life must have been like having to live with the Berlin Wall."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e7f7dcd1-3caf-4461-bd3c-2da843098b9a>","<urn:uuid:2df65504-c8ed-4571-8413-9642ba0c9f07>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm struggling to choose between DIY projects - what's the main difference in the waiting time between cold process soap making and glass etching?","answer":"Glass etching only requires a few hours to complete, with the etching cream needing time to dry according to manufacturer instructions and a few more hours for the design to fully darken. In contrast, cold process soap making requires a much longer waiting period of 4-6 weeks for the curing process to be complete before the soap is ready for use.","context":["Do it yourself glass etching is a fun craft project that, to many people, seems more complex than it is. Do it yourself glass etching is a great way to create a unique gift or a custom keepsake for yourself or a family member. Whether you select from popular glass etching designs or create your own custom pattern, you are sure to be delighted with your finished product\nMaterials Required for Do It Yourself Glass Etching\nPieces of glass are one of the essential parts of creating personalized do it yourself glass etching creations. You can use any piece of glass you want. For instance, you can etch on mirrors, glass in doors, windows, wine glasses, martini glasses, and so on.\nYou will also need either masking, vinyl, or painter's tape; a measuring tape; a paint brush, a craft stick or popsicle stick; etching cream; any desired stencils; adhesive for the stencils; a craft knife or Xacto knife; and a source for water.\nStep One: Clean and Stencil\nFirst, you need to make sure that the piece of glass that you are working with is completely clean. Etching works best on glass that has been cleaned thoroughly with no lint of dirt left behind. After a thorough cleaning, allow the piece of glass to air dry.\nWhen the glass is completely dry, if you are using a stencil to etch, apply the stencil. Several different types of stencils can be used. For example, stencils can be purchased that are self adhesive. For self adhesive stencils, locate the spot where you want the stencil to appear on the glass, remove the backing and place the stencil.\nFor stencils that are not self adhesive, use the adhesive tape to attach the stencil to the glass in the desired spot. Make sure the tape is attached securely so the stencil fits tightly against the glass to avoid etching cream going under the stencil and etching the wrong area of the glass. Once the stencil is applied to the glass, go over it with your craft stick to flatten out any air bubbles, wrinkles, or other blemishes that may appear while taping it down.\nStep Two: Apply Etching Cream\nGather the etching cream you purchased and your paint brush. Dip the paint brush into the etching cream and apply the cream in a thick coat to the stencil. To ensure even etching results, you must make sure of two things:\n- First, make sure that the etching cream does not leak under the stencil by avoiding allowing the cream to accumulate near the edges of the stencils.\n- Second, make sure the application is a thick and even coat.\nOnce you have applied the etching cream, allow it time to dry. Every type of etching cream is different, so follow the instructions on the cream you purchased.\nStep Three: The Reveal\nAfter the recommended time has passed and the cream is dry, it is time to remove your stencil from the glass. Remove the stencil in its entirety, making sure to remove all tape as well. Once you have removed everything, you may notice some adhesive on the glass and some remains of the etching cream.\nWash the glass in warm soapy water until all unwanted residue is off. Allow the glass to dry and your project is complete. Don't worry if the design appears barely noticeable on the glass at first. The etching cream will continue to darken, allowing the stencil design to show more in a few hours or so.\nStep Four: The Cleanup\nOnce you have set your piece aside to dry, take the time to clean off your stencils. Stencils are made for repeated use. Clean them off immediately after the etching and removal process is completed by scrubbing them lightly with soapy warm water or placing them in the dishwasher.\nAdditional Etching Ideas\nEtching can be done inversely as well. For instance, instead of having a clear glass with etched designs, you can also create a glass with a frosted appearance that has clear glass designs amongst the frost. To do this, simply apply solid shapes using self adhesive stencils or adhesive tape to attach solid stencils. Then, dip the entire piece into etching liquid so the glass is covered entirely from top to bottom. Allow the piece to dry according to the recommended drying time for your brand of etching cream. Remove the solid stencils from the glass and you will have achieved the opposite affect: a frosted piece of glass with stenciling done in clear glass.","If you’ve ever wondered what “cold process soap” means, you’re in the right place. In this article, we’ll demystify this popular, natural soap making method by exploring its ingredients, process, benefits, and how it compares to hot process soap. So, what does cold process soap mean?\nCold process means the soap is made without external heat. That is where the “cold process” part of the name comes from. The soap is made by mixing oils, lye solution, and optional additives without external heat. It hardens and matures over several weeks as it cures.\nAs interest in natural and sustainable products grows, cold process soap has gained popularity among both consumers and DIY enthusiasts. Its simple ingredients and creative possibilities make it an appealing choice for those who seek a personalized, skin-friendly soap.\nMoreover, making cold process soap at home can be a fulfilling hobby, allowing you to craft unique, eco-conscious gifts for friends and family or to simply indulge yourself in a luxurious, handcrafted bathing experience.\nLet’s take a closer look at the cold process soap making method.\nBetter Understanding Cold Process Soap\nOils and fats form the foundation of cold process soap. Popular choices include olive oil for a mild, gentle lather; coconut oil for a bubbly, cleansing effect; and sustainably-sourced palm oil for a firm bar. Additionally, luxurious shea and cocoa butters impart moisturizing properties.\nLye, also known as sodium hydroxide, is a potent alkali that reacts with oils through saponification, transforming them into soap. Lye solution is prepared by carefully dissolving lye in water or alternative liquids like milk or tea.\nA variety of additives enhance the soap’s appearance, fragrance, and skincare benefits. Essential oils like lavender and eucalyptus provide natural scents, while herbs, such as calendula and chamomile, contribute gentle exfoliation or soothing effects.\nClays like kaolin or bentonite can detoxify and improve skin texture. Coloring agents stem from natural sources like micas and plant-based powders or soap-specific dyes for creative designs.\nCold Process Soap Making Steps\nPreparing the ingredients\nBefore starting, gather all necessary ingredients, tools, and protective gear. Measure oils, fats, and lye solution accurately using a digital scale.\nMelt solid oils and butters gently until liquid, then let them cool to room temperature. Prepare the lye solution in a well-ventilated area, allowing it to cool as well.\nMixing oils and lye\nOnce cooled, slowly pour the lye solution into the oils while stirring gently. Use an immersion blender to blend the mixture until it reaches a pudding-like consistency, known as “trace.” Add essential oils, additives, and colors at this stage, blending them thoroughly.\nTracing and molding\nWhen the soap reaches trace, it’s time to pour it into a mold. Use a silicone or lined wooden mold to facilitate easy removal.\nGently tap the mold on the counter to release air bubbles, then use a spatula to create a smooth or textured top, as desired.\nCover the filled mold with a towel or insulation to maintain a consistent temperature. Let the soap sit undisturbed for 24-48 hours, then carefully remove it from the mold.\nCut it into bars and place them on a rack or tray, allowing air circulation. Allow the soap to cure for 4-6 weeks to ensure hardness, mildness, and a longer-lasting bar.\nBenefits of Cold Process Soap\nNatural and gentle\nCold process soap is made with natural ingredients, free from harsh chemicals or synthetic detergents. Its gentle, moisturizing properties suit all skin types, including sensitive skin.\nMaking cold process soap offers endless creative possibilities. Choose oils, scents, colors, and additives to create a unique, personalized soap tailored to your preferences or skincare needs.\nCold process soaps generally last longer than commercial alternatives, as they are denser and more concentrated. The curing process allows excess water to evaporate, resulting in a firm, high-quality soap bar.\nCold Process vs. Hot Process Soap\nCold process soap making involves mixing oils and lye solution without heat, while hot process soap requires cooking the mixture to speed up saponification. The two methods result in distinct final products.\nCold process soap tends to have a smoother, more polished appearance, making it ideal for intricate designs and patterns. Hot process soap, due to cooking, has a rustic, rough texture that resembles thick porridge or mashed potatoes.\nCold process soap requires a longer curing time, typically 4-6 weeks, to achieve its optimal qualities. Hot process soap, however, is ready to use immediately after cooling and hardening, as the cooking process eliminates excess water and completes saponification.\nCold Process vs Melt and Pour\nCold process soap and melt and pour soap are two popular methods of soap making that cater to different preferences, skill levels, and creative possibilities.\nCold process soap is made from scratch, using oils, fats, and lye solution. The ingredients are mixed at specific temperatures, traced, molded, and cured over 4-6 weeks.\nThis method requires more expertise, patience, and safety precautions, but it allows for greater customization and control over the ingredients, making it ideal for those seeking a natural and artisanal product.\nCold process soap is known for its gentle, moisturizing properties, and offers endless creative opportunities for colors, scents, and additives.\nMelt and pour soap, on the other hand, involves melting a pre-made soap base, which can be easily customized with colors, fragrances, and additives before pouring into molds.\nThis method is beginner-friendly, as it doesn’t require handling lye or the extensive curing period associated with cold process soap.\nMelt and pour soap making allows for quick, fun, and creative projects, but it often lacks the same level of customization and natural appeal as cold process soap.\nThe choice between cold process and melt and pour soap depends on your skill level, desired level of customization, and the time you’re willing to invest in the soap making process. Both methods offer unique advantages and opportunities for creating personalized, handcrafted soaps.\nCold Process Soap Making Tips\nHere are some tips to guide you through the cold process soap making process.\n- Research the process, safety guidelines, and gather all necessary tools and ingredients.\n- Use a digital scale for accurate measurements.\n- Control the temperature of oils and lye solution during mixing.\n- Be patient and wait for the mixture to reach trace.\n- Test new fragrances and colors in small batches.\n- Experiment with different additives for unique soap properties.\n- Ensure a low-humidity, well-ventilated environment during the curing process.\n- Rotate soap batches for even drying and air circulation.\n- Maintain detailed records of your soap making process.\n- Connect with fellow soap makers for inspiration and support.\nYou can expect to improve your cold process soap making skills by following these tips, leading to the creation of beautiful, high-quality, and unique soap bars. As you gain experience, you’ll be able to craft soaps tailored to your preferences and skincare needs.\nSafety Tips for Cold Process Soap Making\nLye is caustic and can cause burns or irritation upon contact with skin or eyes. When handling lye, always pour it into water or other liquids, not the other way around, to prevent dangerous chemical reactions. Work in a well-ventilated area and avoid breathing in lye fumes.\nTo protect yourself from lye exposure, wear appropriate safety gear, such as gloves, goggles, long sleeves, and closed-toe shoes. Keep a bottle of vinegar nearby to neutralize any lye spills or skin contact.\nAlways follow trusted soap recipes and instructions, particularly regarding lye amounts and proper ratios. Accurate measurements are crucial for a safe and successful soap making experience. Research and understand each ingredient’s properties and characteristics before experimenting with new formulations.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nMaking cold process soap takes a few hours, including preparation, mixing, and molding. However, the curing period requires an additional 4-6 weeks before the soap is ready for use.\nNo, lye is a necessary ingredient for making cold process soap, as it reacts with oils through saponification to produce soap. Without lye, the process would not occur.\nYes, cold process soap is generally safe for sensitive skin, as it contains natural ingredients and lacks harsh chemicals or synthetic detergents found in some commercial soaps.\nYes, natural colorants such as plant-based powders, clays, or micas can be used to add color to cold process soap.\nSilicone or lined wooden molds work well for cold process soap, as they facilitate easy removal of the soap after it has hardened.\nFollow safety precautions like wearing protective gear, handling lye properly, working in a well-ventilated area, and following trusted recipes and instructions to ensure a safe soap making experience.\nIn conclusion, cold process soap offers a natural, gentle, and customizable alternative to conventional soaps. By understanding the ingredients, process, and benefits of this artisanal soap, you can make informed decisions when purchasing or crafting your own soap.\nThe cold process method provides endless creative opportunities and a high-quality, long-lasting product, making it a favorite among soap enthusiasts. As you venture into the world of cold process soap making, remember to follow safety precautions and enjoy the rewarding experience."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:40d0651d-9d2e-4fae-8564-d311db2b181c>","<urn:uuid:095ed315-93a9-489c-80af-b6052a8bedc8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the different ways to track engagement across social platforms versus medical monitoring systems?","answer":"Social platforms rely on hashtags and handles to track engagement, allowing companies to monitor campaign activity and brand mentions through public tweets and posts. Tools like RiteTag provide statistics on hashtag usage and reach. In contrast, medical monitoring systems require secure tracking methods that protect patient privacy - they use Federated Learning frameworks from companies like Google, IBM and Nvidia that enable monitoring without exposing sensitive data. These systems keep patient data local while only sharing model updates between facilities, allowing engagement tracking without compromising confidential medical information.","context":["Hashtags are widely used on social media, but for this post we’ll focus on using hashtags on Twitter. Movember’s Twitter campaign also shows how the usage of an @ sign (called a “handle”) on Twitter and a true hashtag can be blurred. Notice that the author of the tweet also tweeted at the company with the “@hello_piper” handle. A Twitter chat is a pre-scheduled online event that happens right on Twitter. Is it okay to use four, five or six hashtags? That’s a good goal, but people break the six characters rule all the time. You’ll also want to make sure there are no double meanings when words are run all together. You can use fancy tools to find out about who’s using a specific hashtag and what the context is, or you can just go to Twitter, search the hashtag, and look through the stream of tweets. Which Hashtags Should You Use? This is what RiteTag looks like from within Twitter: As you can see, RiteTag gives you a lot of statistics on each hashtag you search for.\nI tried to explain Twitter to my father over the Christmas holiday. He’s 78. He particularly wanted to know what a hashtag is. So I started talking about how the pound symbol always precedes a hashtag and he interrupted: “They’re like tags, right?”\nHashtags are indeed like tags, and they’re used to identify the text they go along with. They start with a hash sign (#), which is immediately followed by a keyword. And the tag part at the end of their name? Well, I think it gave my father a clue.\nHashtags are widely used on social media, but for this post we’ll focus on using hashtags on Twitter. That said, pretty much everything I’ll tell you here applies to the other social media platforms that use hashtags. Those are Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Tumblr, Google+, Google Search, YouTube, Vine, and Kickstarter.\nIf you’ve been avoiding hashtags because you weren’t sure how to use them, or if you’ve been using hashtags without being sure you were using them correctly, we’re here to help. You’ll be able to use hashtags with flair by the end of reading this article.\nLet’s start with the different types of hashtags. Knowing about them will show you more about how to use hashtags than anything else.\nBrand and Campaign Hashtags\nThese are the most widely used kind of hashtags. If you’ve ever even looked at a Twitter stream, you’ll have seen one. Brand hashtags do just what it sounds like they do: They support and build on a brand. Campaign hashtags are similar, but are focused on marketing campaigns.\nHere’s an example: The Verizon Wireless tweet below includes a campaign hashtag. Verizon is leveraging the popularity of the Super Bowl to gain exposure. This kind of commercial piggybacking on a wider cultural event is in the DNA of social media marketing. Hashtags are the perfect tool to do it with.\n“Movember” is a great example of a campaign that had no overt commercial intent, but was still picked up and spun by hundreds of social media marketers. “Movember,” if you did not know, is the international month of mustache appreciation.\nMovember’s Twitter campaign also shows how the usage of an @ sign (called a “handle”) on Twitter and a true hashtag can be blurred. Technically, the @ sign is used to send a public tweet to the attention of a specific Twitter account. But sometimes it works like a hashtag. Anything goes: The hashtag police have yet to ticket anyone for using a Twitter handle instead of a hashtag.\nThe two tweets below exhibit some of the rules of engagement for the Movember campaign. First, there’s the Jameson whiskey tweet. That shows the commercial twist that this “movement” incited. Then there’s the tweet below of the mustache clippings. The author of that tweet used both the hashtag and the @ sign for more exposure. It worked: The tweet was retweeted by the official Movember account.\nWhy use a brand or campaign hashtag? It’s an efficient way to track campaign activity. It’s also a way to get a brand, campaign or an idea out in front of people. Every time someone saw a “#Movember” hashtag stream by, they were hit with another brand impression.\nAnother way to use hashtags is to give people credit for something when they use your hashtag in their tweet, post or share. For instance, if you were running a Facebook contest, you could enter people into your contest every time they used the contest’s hashtag.\nTypes of Hashtags\nWhether you’re a B2B or B2C marketer, you probably use at least one of these hashtags on almost a daily basis:\n- Product hashtags\n- Event hashtags\n- Lifestyle hashtags\n- Location hashtags\nLet’s take a closer look at how they work on Twitter.\nHere’s an example of a product hashtag:\n#Pipernv is a product. Notice that the author of the tweet also tweeted at the company with the “@hello_piper” handle. Why do that? Because the company might retweet this since it mentions and promotes their product. The company may also be tracking #Pipernv, and might retweet this just to amplify someone’s positive opinion of their product.\nSee the event hashtag…","Do not let Big Bro in! – Security and privacy in elderly carepolaris_stable_admin\nIn our previous post we talked about how elderly care is becoming one of the most fundamental challenges across the world. It is clear that we will need all the tricks IT can offer, be it cloud computing, edge devices or AI. However, these shiny, new technologies are not without serious risks regarding privacy, material loss or even immediate danger of life. As elderly care regards, these risks are even more pronounced.\nPicture this. You think your grandma is fine as her well-being is monitored indoor (using cameras, lidars, etc) and outdoor (via wearable devices, etc). But what if someone can tap into the data communication and can see when the apartment is empty. Or by stealing the biometric data, it is a piece of cake to steal money or commit fraud. What is even worse, what if someone can fiddle with the smart pacemaker or the insulin pump remotely? Well, actually, it did already happen (shorturl.at/bkrX2).\nWhile all these hybrid (physical and cyber security) issues would worth a separate post on their own, we now want to introduce you to another aspect of privacy concerns: learning from highly sensitive data.\nAs we have talked about how data is important for learning complex patterns of the world, it is no surprise that health care monitoring or modeling behavioural patterns need lots of patient data. Those data can be as simple as the number of doctor-patient contacts a month or as complex as heart rate variation on a second by second basis. The problem is that we need to make sure that no personal information (“meta data”) gets mingled with the data needed to train the AI models. Why is that? Well, making such sensitive data open can pose direct threat to the participants. What is more, there is an indirect risk that can hurt even those who are not providing data to the training process, but are somewhat related to the patients.\nFor health monitoring, the problem is not limited to the model training phase. Continuous monitoring of the participants requires to maintain contact and repeated access to sensitive data. This data is then used to provide predictions as well as useful information to update (fine tune) the learning models (continual learning scenario). So how can we secure the flow of sensitive data? And how can we make sure that personal information is not getting into the wrong hands?\nThere are existing solutions that either try to hide or erase sensitive information (various kinds of anonymization) or try to deeply encrypt the communication channel.\nHowever, there is another smart idea that is designed to render the communication of sensitive info unnecessary. This approach is called federated learning. Let us see what this is all about.\nFederated Learning (FL)\nAccording to WIKI: “Federated learning is a machine learning technique that trains an algorithm across multiple decentralized edge devices or servers holding local data samples, without exchanging them. Federated learning enables multiple actors to build a common, robust machine learning model without sharing data, thus allowing to address critical issues such as data privacy, data security, data access rights and access to heterogeneous data. Its applications are spread over a number of industries including defense, telecommunications, IoT, and pharmaceutics.”\nThe term was coined by Google (https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.05629v3) back at 2017.\nLet us dive into this complex definition. The first interesting technology involved is called distributed learning. To brush up our knowledge, let us talk a bit about machine learning, in particular, supervised learning. Here the task is to learn to associate labels with data. Machine learning algorithms learn the association by incrementally tuning parameters that define the chain of transformations that make up the algorithm. Now we talk about millions or billions of those parameters! That explains why training is so tedious in most cases. However, if several machines can parallel work on different bunch of data, then training becomes much faster if the trained model variations are properly combined into one single solution. The other thing that pops up is that FL is ideal when privacy preserving is of central importance. The whole idea is about minimizing data exchange between the clients (unit that can train a model on local data) and the server (a unit that aggregates local model updates, organizes parameter exchange, but does not have access to data). This particular issue is getting so important that it makes FL a central part of all AI applications across various indsutries and business: Google, IBM, Intel, Baidu or Nvidia have all come up with their enterprise grade FL frameworks (shorturl.at/dgiy7)!\nThe original idea was based on the assumption that edge devices (like smart phones) can both collect and process data locally. In turn, if models can fit into the phone’s memory, than it is enough to exchange local updates with a central model. This concept is called cross-device FL. Personalized texting like Gboard is using this approach.\nWell, texting is fine on mobiles, but measuring blood sugar? So there is another real-life scenario. You already have shared your medical data with your doctor so as have all her other patients. In turn, the health care center can tune its own model using all the available data. Centers can exchange the model parameters without exposing their own patient data. This approach is called cross-silo FL.\nSee the picture below! Normally data are collected and aggregated across the different locations and a central unit trains a model using all the data collected. This setup definitely raises the red flag as sensitive medical records are moving around. But here comes cross-silo FL to the rescue! Privacy is preserved, well done!\nClearly, cross-device and cross-silo FL types define the scaling dimension of FL. In the last few years many new ideas have been discussed and now there are at least 6 factors that are needed to differentiate between the various solutions.\nData partitioning is about how participant and their features (data records) are treated across the different local models. While the original idea assumed that each client node has the very same representation on the participants, there are reak life scenarios where data gets partitioned by feature sets and not by user id. As an example, a bank and an insurance company may have access to different data on the very same user, yet they can mutually improve each other’s models.\nMachine Learning modeling is about the core model applied within FL. The more complex the model, the more update exchange is needed. As FL regards, the most important question is how to aggregate the local updates when facing reliability and communication bandwidth issues.\nPrivacy Mechanism is a core component of the FL frameworks. The basic idea is to avoid information leakage amongst clients. Differential privacy (that is to separate user specific and generally relevant information) and cryptography are two frequently used approaches, but this is a constantly evolving field.\nCommunication Architecture. The original idea suggested an orchestrated approach to model training where the central server holds the aggregated model that is mirrored in the local units. More recent solutions drop centrality and suggest various decentralized updating mechanisms. In these solutions client nodes communicate with a few peers and there is a particular policy on update propagation.\nWe talked about Scaling, and the last point is about the Motivating Factors for applying FL. In some cases, stringent regulations force us to turn to FL (consider GDPR in Europe, CCPA in the US or PIPL in China). In other cases shared cost and increased reliability could be the main driving forces.\nIf you wonder why we have so many factors to check just think about the immensely different challenges in e-commerce (personalized ad), finance (fraud detection) or healthcare (remote diagnostics, etc, see https://www.nature.com/articles/s41746-020-00323-1). Different requirements require different solutions.\nSo what are the main challenges that FL solutions meet?\nUpdating large models requires sending large messages. Another problem is limited bandwidth: when a large number of clients try to send data, many will fail. The solution for the first problem involves a form of compression, while the second one is addressed by the introduction of decentralized (peer2peer and gossip) networks, when updates are exchanged locally. One example solution is depicted in the figure next:\nPrivacy and data protection\nWhile raw data stay where it was generated, model updates can be attacked and reveal private information. Some solutions are built around differential privacy, where only statistical (general) data are extracted and used for model training (https://privacytools.seas.harvard.edu/differential-privacy). Another interesting idea is to perform computation on encrypted data only (“homomorphic encryption” for those who like scientific terms). Yet another idea goes to the opposite direction: let us spread the sensitive data across many data owners, but computations can only be done in a collaborative fashion. Cool, isn’t it?\nFor really large FL systems, nodes are most likely quite different in terms of storage capacity, computing power, and communication bandwidth. And only a handful of them participates in the update at a given time, resulting in biased training. Solution? Asynchronous communication, sampling of active devices and increased fault tolerance.\nClients may get different data in terms of quality (noisy, missing info, etc) and statistical properties (difference in distribution). That is big one and it is not easy to fix or even to detect. What is even worse, nodes with their local models can be compromised to enable a “model poisoning” attack (https://proceedings.mlr.press/v108/bagdasaryan20a.html): specially crafted data and local model updates drag the aggregated model toward an unwanted state causing erratic behavior and damage.\nIf you have read this far, you must share our enthusiasm for FL.

{"question":"In French parenting and AI development, what are the strict rules and guidelines that govern both domains?","answer":"In French parenting, there are very strict and well-defined rules, particularly around mealtimes. French parents enforce set mealtimes with absolutely no snacking allowed, and children are expected to try foods multiple times until they develop a taste for them. This results in children who eat the same foods as adults, including sophisticated items like foie gras and stinky cheese. Similarly, in AI development, there are strict guidelines and frameworks that must be followed. These include ensuring transparency and accountability in AI systems, implementing robust cybersecurity measures, protecting privacy through data encryption and anonymization, and establishing ethical guidelines to address issues like algorithmic bias. Both domains emphasize the importance of clear rules and structured approaches to achieve desired outcomes.","context":["Parenting Habits Around the World\nThere are universals when it comes to raising kids: children need enough sleep, food, and nurturing to thrive. But how we deliver those necessities varies depending on your culture.\nAmerican parents are highly focused on making sure that their children’s talents are groomed for success. Sara Harkness, a professor in the Department of Human Development and Family Studies at the University of Connecticut and a pioneering researcher on parenting and culture, found that nearly 25 percent of all of the descriptors used by American parents were a derivation of “smart,” “gifted” or “advanced.” “Our sense of needing to push children to maximize potential is partly driven by fear of the child failing in an increasingly competitive world where you can’t count on the things that our parents could count on,” Harkness suggests. In the Netherlands, meanwhile, parents used “smart” to describe their children only 10 percent of the time. Dutch parents believe strongly in not pushing their children too hard. “People would talk about a cousin who got a PhD and was very unhappy because there were no jobs at universities, and said that you shouldn’t teach your child to read before they got to school, because then your child would be bored at school and not have any friends,” says Harkness.\nNorwegians believe that it is better for children to be in daycare as toddlers. When a kid turns 1 year old, he or she starts going to Barnehage (Norwegian for “children’s garden”), then they enter school and organized activities. Regularly scheduled rest, food and a pleasant environment are the top priorities for Dutch parents.\nIt’s not uncommon to see kids bundled up outside during a Scandinavian winter, taking a nap in their strollers. In Denmark, writes Hopgood, “children are frequently left outside to get frisk luft, or fresh air — something parents think is essential for health and hearty development — while caregivers dine and shop.” As you might imagine, this idea sends shivers down the spines of many parents in the United States. In New York, a couple (one of whom was Danish) was arrested for leaving their child outside a BBQ restaurant while they went inside to eat. Read more here.\nIn the Polynesian islands, it’s the kids that take care of kids. Mei-Ling Hopgood writes in her book, How Eskimos Keep Their Babies Warm, that adults take the lead in caring for babies in Polynesia, but as soon as a child can walk, he or she is turned over to the care of other children. “Preschool-aged children learned to calm babies,” she wrote, “and toddlers became self-reliant because they were taught that that was the only way they could hang out with the big kids.” Jane and James Ritchie, a husband-and-wife anthropology team,here observed a similar phenomenon over decades in New Zealand and the Polynesian Islands. “Indeed in Western societies, the degree of child caretaking that seems to apply in most of Polynesia would probably be regarded as child neglect and viewed with some horror,” they wrote in Growing Up in Polynesia. Read more here.\nFor the Aka people in central Africa, the male and female roles are virtually interchangeable. The men will strap their infants into slings and take them on elephant hunts, and will even offer a nipple to soothe a fussy baby. While the women hunt, the men mind the children. According to professor Barry Hewlett, an American anthropologist, “There’s a level of flexibility that’s virtually unknown in our society,” Hewlett told The Guardian. “Aka fathers will slip into roles usually occupied by mothers without a second thought and without, more importantly, any loss of status — there’s no stigma involved in the different jobs. Read more here.\nIn Japan, it isn’t uncommon for 7-year-olds and even 4-year-olds to independently run errands, take the Toyko subways by themselves, and walk on busy streets alone, just like their Japanese peers. Both in Japan and Norway, parents are focused on cultivating independence. Children do things alone early, whether it’s walking to school or to the movies. The frames, however, are different. Read more here.\nIn Scandinavia, there is an emphasis on a democratic relationship between parents and children. In Sweden especially, the “rights” of a child are important. For example, a child has the “right” to access their parents’ bodies for comfort, and therefore should be allowed into their parents’ bed with them in the middle of the night. If a parent doesn’t allow them, they are both denying them their rights and being a neglectful parent. In parts of Asia, meanwhile, co-sleeping with a family member through late childhood is common, but within a family, obedience is key — not democracy. Read more here.\nIn Argentina and Spain, family dinner time takes precedence over bed times and sleep routines. Children of all ages from babies to teens stay up late; they are out on the town with parents and extended families and go to dinners that start as late as ten and eleven at night. Spanish families are focused on the social and interpersonal aspects of child development, according to Sara Harkness, a professor in the Department of Human Development and Family Studies at the University of Connecticut. The idea of a child going to bed at 6:30 p.m. is totally alien to Spanish parents, Harkness told TED. “They were horrified at the concept,” she said. “Their kids were going to bed at 10 p.m.” so they could participate in family life in the evenings. The same is true in Argentina, according to Hopgood. Read more here.\nIn France, there are very set mealtimes and no snacking whatsoever. There is an expectation that if you try something enough times, you’ll like it. These are among the “food rules” in France that are taken as given. The result is French kids who eat what adults eat, from foie gras to mussels to stinky cheese. Read more here.\nIn Vietnam and China, mom and dads teach their babies to pee at the sound of a whistle. Parents start by noticing when their baby starts peeing and making a little whistle sound. In addition, babies wear onesies and pants with large slits in the crotch area so parents can frequently and easily run their kids over to the toilet. And soon enough, babies start to associate the whistle with peeing and voila! Researchers say Vietnamese babies are usually out of diapers by 9 months. Read more here.","1. The Impact of AI in our Society\nArtificial intelligence (AI) has become an integral part of our daily lives. From voice assistants to autonomous vehicles, AI technology has the potential to transform various industries and enhance efficiency. However, as AI continues to advance, it is crucial to consider the ethical implications associated with its development and utilization.\nOne major concern is the potential bias embedded in AI algorithms. AI systems are often trained on large datasets that reflect the biases and prejudices present in society. This can lead to discrimination and unfair decision-making, as AI systems may inadvertently perpetuate existing social inequalities. It is essential for developers to address these biases and ensure that AI systems are designed to be inclusive and unbiased.\nAdditionally, the impact of AI on the job market cannot be overlooked. As AI technology automates certain tasks, there is a risk of job displacement for many individuals. It is crucial to prioritize re-education and training programs to equip workers with the skills needed for the future job market. Ethical considerations should be given to the potential social and economic disruptions caused by AI.\n2. Privacy and Data Protection\nThe development of AI relies heavily on data, often collected from individuals. As AI systems gather and analyze vast amounts of personal information, it raises concerns about privacy and data protection. Stricter regulations should be implemented to safeguard individuals’ data and ensure transparency in how it is collected, stored, and used.\nFurthermore, AI systems that process personal data may generate new insights and predictions about individuals. This raises concerns about the potential misuse of personal information and the potential for discrimination. It is crucial for developers to prioritize privacy by design, implementing measures such as data encryption and anonymization to protect individuals’ identities and prevent unauthorized access.\n3. Responsible AI Development\nResponsible AI development requires developers to consider the potential risks and unintended consequences of their creations. AI systems should be transparent, explainable, and accountable for their decisions. This means that developers must ensure that AI systems can provide clear explanations for their outcomes and that they can be held accountable in cases of unintended harm or errors.\nAnother important aspect of responsible AI development is ensuring the safety and security of AI systems. With the increasing integration of AI into critical infrastructure such as healthcare and transportation, any vulnerabilities in AI systems can have severe consequences. Developers must prioritize robust cybersecurity measures to protect against potential attacks and unauthorized access.\n4. Social Impact of AI\nAI technology has the potential to shape our society in profound ways. It is essential to consider the ethical implications of AI in areas such as surveillance, weaponization, and autonomous decision-making. The use of AI in surveillance raises concerns about privacy and civil liberties, with the potential for mass surveillance and constant monitoring. Development and deployment of AI-powered weapons raise questions about the ethics of autonomous killing.\nMoreover, the use of AI in decision-making processes, such as determining creditworthiness or criminal sentencing, raises concerns about transparency and fairness. It is crucial to ensure that AI systems do not contribute to bias or discrimination and that there is transparency in how decisions are made.\n5. Collaboration and Ethical Guidelines\nAddressing ethical considerations in AI development requires collaboration among various stakeholders, including policymakers, researchers, ethicists, and technologists. It is important to establish ethical guidelines and frameworks to guide the development and deployment of AI systems. These guidelines should address issues such as algorithmic bias, privacy, and accountability.\nFurthermore, collaboration between academia, industry, and government is crucial to ensure that AI development is aligned with societal values and needs. Ongoing dialogue and interdisciplinary research can help navigate the ethical challenges posed by AI and mitigate potential risks.

{"question":"How do Horace Mann Elementary and ACECQA approach food education and mealtimes - what are their similarities in promoting healthy eating and learning?","answer":"Both institutions emphasize the connection between food, education, and holistic learning. ACECQA promotes mealtimes as social, educational experiences where children learn about numeracy, literacy, and their world while developing relationships. Similarly, Horace Mann Elementary integrates food education through their rooftop garden, teaching kitchen, and community room with a share table. Both approaches focus on sustainability, with Horace Mann featuring garden-to-table eating and food sharing programs, while ACECQA encourages connecting mealtime environments to gardens and waste processing for learning opportunities.","context":["ACECQA’s National Education Leader, Rhonda Livingstone shares her insight into National Quality Framework topics of interest.\nMealtimes at education and care services offer many rich opportunities to promote positive outcomes for children. Positive mealtimes are not only about nutritional requirements – they can shape children’s learning, development, health and wellbeing.\nThey involve every child enjoying nutritious and culturally appropriate food and snacks in a social, responsive, pleasurable, safe and educative environment. They also demonstrate outcomes from each National Quality Standard (NQS) quality area.\nI encourage you to view your current mealtimes with a positive mealtime ‘lens’ and use these reflective questions to inspire conversations with your team.\n1. Does your physical environment promote positive mealtimes?\nThe physical environment (NQS Quality Area 3) influences quality practice and has a significant impact on mealtimes and the potential for social interaction, learning, inclusion, safety, and wellbeing. The change in mood when we eat outdoors is a perfect example of this impact.\nThe components of this physical environment are broad, including everything from table and chair arrangements and table settings to noise levels and serving utensils.\nEach service has a unique environment, and few have access to purpose-built, family-style dining areas. Food may also be brought from home to be eaten at the service. In outside-school-hours care services, food may be eaten on a bench or in a hall that requires daily transformation.\nWhatever the environment, consider these questions:\n- Mealtime location: Does it promote a sense of belonging? Does it support mealtimes being social and relaxed occasions where children have time to eat, choose and interact, or does it uphold mealtimes as a rushed routine?\n- Is the environment child-centred? Do furniture and utensils suit different ages and sizes of children? Does the space accommodate children’s developing skills and independence and the inherent ‘mess’ that can sometime come with it?\n- Inclusion: Can each child access, participate and engage in mealtimes? Does the environment reflect and respect children’s needs?\n- Table settings: Do table and chair arrangements promote social interaction and engagement between children and between educators and children? Do table settings support mealtimes as an occasion?\n- Agency: Does the environment promote children’s agency and self-help skills? E.g. setting tables; finding their place; sharing food; serving food; processing waste.\n- Connection to the broader food environment: Is there a connection between mealtime and other food environments? This connection could be physical (e.g. the dining area is next to the kitchen; garden produce is used in meals); social (e.g. the cook has a relationship with children and educators; garden produce is shared with families); or through the educational program (e.g. the kitchen, garden, mealtimes or composting are used for learning experiences).\n- Transitions: Are transitions to and from mealtime environments respectful to children and calm?\n2. Do mealtimes nurture relationships?\nSecure, respectful and reciprocal relationships are fundamental principles of the approved learning frameworks, and relationships between children and with children are integral to NQS Quality Area 5.\nConnections with others support the development of children’s identity and social and emotional competence. Research has confirmed the nature, quality and consistency of interactions between educators and children is one of the most important influences on quality education and care.\nMealtimes are intrinsically social and offer regular opportunities to have positive interactions, build secure relationships, learn from one another, provide emotional support, promote language and inspire learning.\nYou could also consider:\n- Positive interactions: Educators who consistently model positive interactions and mealtime skills will support children’s development.\n- Relationship building opportunities: Are educators able to sit with children at mealtimes or is attention focused on simultaneously serving, cleaning, supervising, setting up environments or doing paperwork? Quality interactions and relationships need quality time and attention.\n3. Do mealtimes promote holistic health?\nHealthy eating is integral to promoting children’s health (NQS Quality Area 2), with physical, social and emotional health all being nurtured by positive meals times. A healthy menu (or healthy food brought from home) provides a firm foundation for health.\nFor holistic health, the healthy menu needs to be provided safely and in a health-promoting environment that also considers social and emotional health and wellbeing. The mealtime environment, relationships and staffing are important influences.\nBeyond the firm foundation of a healthy menu, you could promote positive social and emotional health and wellbeing by:\n- Creating positive mealtimes that are social, relaxed and calm\n- Actively involving children in mealtimes\n- Never using food as a punishment or reward\n- Not discussing food in relation to a child’s weight or size\n- Not labelling foods as good/bad/clean/junk; instead, talk about ‘everyday’ and ‘sometimes/treat’ foods\n- Respecting children’s appetites and preferences and never forcing children to eat\n- Respecting children’s cultural diversity and the values and beliefs of families (NQS Quality Area 6)\n- Being respectful of children and families when food choices or food brought from home are inconsistent with food and nutrition policies\n- Ensuring the menu reflects the needs of the children and community.\n4. Are mealtimes a part of the educational program?\nPositive mealtimes offer immense opportunity for each child’s learning and development to be enhanced and extended (NQS Quality Area 1).\nMealtimes allow children to learn about:\n- their identity (I prefer certain foods. My family celebrates our culture with food.)\n- relationships (When we sit for lunch, we share the milk. I like to sit next to my friend so I can talk to them.)\n- their community (We grow mint in our garden. Our cook’s name is Sam.)\n- literacy (My name card has an ‘A’. I can explain how to chop fruit.)\n- numeracy (There are six people at our table. I can make a pattern with my peas.), and\n- their world (Pancakes are made from wheat. When I have food in my mouth I don’t try and talk at the same time).\nConnecting the mealtime environment to the kitchen, garden and waste processing also supports learning and development.\n5. Does staffing organisation and leadership promote positive mealtimes?\nFor mealtimes to be social, responsive, pleasurable, safe and educative, educators need to be seen as an important part of them. Staffing at mealtimes can be challenging as staff responsibilities and meal breaks are juggled.\nPositive mealtimes that are embedded in practice are visible in policies, procedures and programs, and guided by the service philosophy.\nFurther reading and resources\nACECQA – Information Sheet – Relationships with children\nACECQA – Information Sheet – Supporting agency: Involving children in decision-making\nACECQA – Information Sheet – The environment as “The Third Teacher’\nDepartment of Health – Resources – Get up and Grow: Healthy eating and physical activity\nStephanie Alexander Kitchen Garden Foundation – Resources – Pleasurable food education","Horace Mann Elementary in northwest Washington D.C. is a student-centered, personalized learning environment serving a diverse student body.\nThe school values complementary approaches: one that offers students explicit strategy-based instruction, and one that offers a broad, constructivist approach that allows students to linger in the exploratory and discovery phases, only later to arrive at explicit ones.\nAfter spending a few years on the modernization list, the faculty had time to translate thoughtful values into design implications. A couple examples include:\nCollaboration and Connection\n- A da Vinci Suite at the center of the building that features our Library, Science Lab, Art Studio and Performing Arts spaces\n- Purposeful gathering spaces for adult learning\n- Windows that let in light and make learning visible to all!\n- Shared spaces such as a new assembly space and the return of The Range\nSustainability and Stewardship\n- LEED Gold Certification\n- Multiple-use spaces that promote efficiency and connection\n- Rooftop gardening, a teaching kitchen, and horticultural therapy\n- Tangible design elements that teach and promote active learning\nChoice and Invention\n- Flexible and public spaces for learning\n- Small-group and independent learning spaces\n- Spaces that invite inventive play!\nIn this podcast, Tom Vander Ark talks more with Horace Mann principal Liz Whisnant about the most interesting pedagogy to facilities translation that we’ve encountered.\nThe school’s values and associated design implications are also shown below.\n|At Horace Mann we aspire to nurture a love of learning in all learners, small and tall. Collaboration among and between our students and adults is ever constant.\n- Paramount need for adequately sized flexible spaces that enable cross-grade and small group collaboration among students and adults.\n- A Media Center that is highly visible and accessible and serves as a hub for learning and collaboration and celebrates a love of reading.\n- Non-classroom meeting space that helps us serve an additional adult community in our role as a Professional Development School for American University and others (Trinity, GW) and a professional lab site for schools across the city and region seeking exemplars in the teaching and learning domain (Balanced Literacy, Responsive Classroom, inquiry-based science, constructivist math, ELL programming, etc.).\n- Special requirements for our smallest PreK learners with a design that supports our Reggio Emila program (ample light, project space, natural furniture, access to the outdoors).\n- Desire for communal planning spaces for faculty rather than discrete ones; classrooms should not be designed with “offices;” shared planning spaces which promote collaboration and community are needed.\n|A persistent and daily goal is the capacity of the school to enable all its members–student, faculty, and parent–to be known, valued, and connected\n- Gathering spaces that enable students and school adults to assemble for community-building celebrations and performances.\n- Places to play!\n- Attention to appropriate scale (e.g. size of rooms, lobby, and furniture height) for young learners.\n- Ample avenues for presentation of student work (hallways, wall surfaces).\n- Adult spaces that are shared and promote collaboration (no separate offices).\n- At least one gathering space that enables the full assembly of students, school adults and parents for community‐building celebrations.\n- A clear and accessible main entrance with a purpose‐filled welcome/security station and access to waiting area that is not connected to instructional space.\n- A premium on creating a pedestrian campus with exterior spaces that support the tradition of students and parents gathering in class communities outside at morning drop off and afternoon dismissal\n|The place where we live is to be cherished. Understanding our role as caretakers and stewards of the earth’s resources is paramount to being an educated citizen\n- The traditional look of our original building (front porch, natural woods, ceramic tiles) is to be valued as part of our legacy. New spaces should be in harmony with these elements and sense of place.\n- Our outside learning spaces are as critical as our inside ones and should provide relevance and ownership for all in our community; outdoor play spaces will be inventive, natural, and easily accessible and serve various sizes of learners. Outside learning should include hands on gardening as well as demonstration spaces for instruction.\n- Spaces that connect us–physically and visually–to the outdoors will help us realize our goals of connection, appreciation, and place‐based learning. In turn, our indoor spaces should bring the light of the outdoors in and allow vistas to the environment outside.\n- The building should serve as a teaching tool, an exemplar of how the principles of conservation and sustainability can be lived and practiced; these elements should be visible, tangible, and interactive forces within our building, not passive ones.\n- A teaching kitchen for adult and student use will connect our gardening work and our commitment to healthy living through attention to both what we eat and where it came from.\n- A messy room that serves as a transition space for indoor and outdoor projects and provides a place for exploration and creation\n- Spaces should be built to serve multiple roles, not singular ones; we value design features that purposefully engage use of space in dynamic ways.\n|We believe that choice is the basis of democracy and is a right that belongs to all within our community\n- Instructional spaces need to be highly flexible in design, with few installed pieces of furniture so that configurations can be modified by staff for various work stations within a class as well as combined class collaborations.\n- Attention to public, private and shared spaces for learning responds to the varying needs of learning styles in our community.\n- Design features and decisions need to match our community’s practices (e.g., serious attention to the value we place on learning outdoors; with over 50% of our population who bring daily lunch to school, a full scale from-scratch kitchen is not warranted; a small dual purpose kitchen with attention to scale, demonstration areas, recycling and composting is).\n|Mann is a passionate, joyful community that values play and invention\n- Spaces that live multiple lives enabled through innovation in design (garage door walls that open to the garden, decorative floor surfaces etc.).\n- Design of the studio art space that is flexible, inventive and visible is paramount; the space should take full advantage of natural light.\n- As we currently enjoy multiple outdoor play spaces separated by age groups, a premium on maintaining multi-‐use spaces will be made; improvement to an indoor play space is badly needed.\n- A science room that can shift from classroom to lab easily and that connects to our gardens and outdoor learning spaces.\n- A multipurpose space for messy work with our hands, whether for art, science, or cooking.\n- Every opportunity to be playful in the design of space will be appreciated; color and attributes of learning will be welcome!\nGardening is integrated into the life of the school. Gardens on campus include a pollinator garden, herb garden, sensory garden, and roof top garden featuring tower planters (also in the lobby, left).\nMann students learn about farm to table eating by growing their own food. Lunch often includes salad with garden lettuce, herbs, and vegetables.\nThe community room, where students eat, includes a share table where students can leave items they are not going to eat. Uneaten items are taken to a local food bank.\nThe art class focuses on teaching artistic behaviors with choice on how to explore specific themes. Classes begin and end with goal setting and reflection.\nThe entryway includes a garden wall with art that spells out values evident in every room of Horace Mann: adventure, discovery, inspiration, and imagination.\nFor more check out:\nStay in-the-know with all things EdTech and innovations in learning by signing up to receive the weekly Smart Update."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:05f5fe1c-134f-4cf4-9331-101eeadba312>","<urn:uuid:7edfda77-4d7b-4e66-85f2-a69a178ac3c3>"],"error":null}

{"question":"Hello! I am astronomy student who likes both Spain and New Mexico. Can you tell me which one has better protected skies for star observation - La Palma in Canary Islands or the area near Socorro in New Mexico?","answer":"Both locations are excellent for astronomical observation, but they have different protections and features. La Palma is designated as a Natural Reserve of the Sky with strict light pollution regulations - residents even need permission to put light bulbs on their porches. It hosts the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory with telescopes from over 60 scientific institutions. In New Mexico, the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array near Socorro is considered one of the world's best places for astronomical observation, featuring 27 radio telescopes that are 25 meters high. Both locations prioritize dark skies, but La Palma has more formal legal protections specifically for astronomical purposes.","context":["The island is rich in places with magical skies: Macarella cove, Pilar cove, Cavalleria beach, Punta Nati, Santo Tomás beach, Monte Toro, the S’Albufera des Grau Natural Park … It has been a heavenly paradise since ancient times. “It has a spectacular archaeological heritage, especially from the Talayotic era (during the Bronze and Iron Ages) that can be linked to stargazing,” said Irene Estaún, insular director of the Biosphere Reserve.\nTERUEL / Exists and excels\nThere are 23 towns in Teruel with outstanding skies. “The Gúdar-Javalambre region is one of the best areas in Europe to observe the sky,” proclaims the Starlight Foundation.

Constellations, planets such as Saturn, Mars, Uranus or Neptune, the moon, galaxies, nebulae or the tears of San Lorenzo will be some of the stellar objects that can be observed through telescopes. Here, a pure place: the night next to a church in La Santa (La Rioja).\nGALICIA / A side by side wonder\nFrom the top of Peña Trevinca –in the municipality of A Veiga, (Ourense) – at 2,127 meters above sea level, you can see the Milky Way from side to side. It is one of the best Spanish watchtowers to enjoy the sky, with two viewpoints in the Tablilla das Lagoas and O Rañadoiro from where you can see, for example, the Andromeda galaxy. Interesting Astrotourism Xornadas are organized there. It is a place with such an impressive sky that even the accommodations in the area have telescopes.\nGeorge is Digismak’s reported cum editor with 13 years of experience in Journalism","Above: If you're driven by a competitive spirit and a love of fresh powder, hit New Mexico's ski areas this month.

{"question":"How do camera positioning requirements differ between jewelry and portrait photography?","answer":"For jewelry photography, the camera needs to be mounted on a tripod due to close-up shooting and potentially long exposure times, with focus on the most important part like a gem or watch face. In contrast, for portrait photography, the camera position should align with the subject's eyes, be raised slightly, and tilted down toward the subject with a subtle angle. These different positioning requirements reflect the distinct challenges of each type of photography - preventing blur in detailed close-ups for jewelry, versus creating flattering angles for human subjects in portraits.","context":["There are many reasons why you might want to photograph your jewelry. Perhaps you run a business and need to photograph your products for your website; maybe you have a special heirloom you want to immortalise for posterity; or you might just want to experiment and have some fun.\nWhatever your reasons, jewelry photography can be surprisingly difficult - simply placing it on a table and snapping away is likely to result in a series of dull, lifeless, uninspiring photos that doesn't show your jewelry in its best light.\nTaking photos of jewelry requires some careful preparation and the patience to experiment with variations of lighting, positioning, and composition. By doing so, you'll ensure that your photos come out sharp and stunning.\nIt's All About Lighting\nI can't over-stress how important lighting is in jewelry photography. Hard, dark shadows (like those produced by your camera's flash) can easily overpower the delicacy of the jewelry, distracting your attention away from what really matters. For this reason it's important to light your jewelry with a soft light, and from all directions.\nThe best way to achieve this is by using a light tent. To use it you simply place your jewelry inside, and set up your lighting on the outside. The thin walls allow the light through, but also scatter it, creating a diffused, soft light which lights the jewelry from all directions.\nIf you don't want to splash out on a light tent, you can always make your own light tent - it's cheap and very effective.\nSet Up Your Camera\nA tripod is an essential bit of kit for jewelry photography. You will be shooting very close up, and possibly using quite long exposure times. This makes camera shake a real possibility, and blur can easily ruin a jewelry photo.\nFocusing - use your camera's point focusing mode, or better still use full manual focusing. Focus on the most important part of the jewelry, such as the gem on a ring or the face on a watch.\nAperture - the aperture size depends on the effect you want. If you want your jewelry to be completely in focus, use a small aperture. If you want just a part of your jewelry to be sharp, with the rest blurred, use a wider aperture. Experiment with different sizes to see which shows off your jewelry best. Personally I like to use an aperture small enough to keep the entire piece of jewelry in focus, but large enough to blur the background. Most digital SLRs offer an aperture priority mode which is perfect for this.\nExposure time - if your camera is in automatic mode, it will try to compensate for the very light background by reducing the exposure time. This will leave you will a dull, grey image. If you have manual mode, use this instead and keep increasing the exposure time until you get a photo with the right colour background. If you are stuck with auto mode, use your camera's exposure compensation to brighten the scene up.\nJewelry photography calls for absolute perfection and, no matter how carefully you set up your photo, it is rare to achieve it straight out of the camera. Use a software package like Photoshop or GIMP to crop your image, adjust the levels, and sharpen everything up.\nTaking It A Step Further\nOnce you've mastered the basics you can move on to some more adventurous stuff:\nPlace your jewelry on a reflective surface, such as a black or white acrylic \"riser\", to add a reflection underneath your jewelry. This technique is commonly used by professional jewelry photographers.\nRather than just lying your jewelry down, use a small blob of wax to make is stand up. This can be particularly effective for items of jewelry such as broaches or pendants, allowing you to show off their detail in a different way.","Headshot Photography: Smiles in All Scenarios\nImagery is a powerful tool that can provide people with a sense of familiarity and connection to people they haven’t met before. One of the most common forms of photography sets itself up perfectly for this connection: headshots and portraiture.\nA conventional headshot can serve as a warm invitation to learn more about an organization or agency and help promote further engagement. But how can photos like these be achieved? With proper execution of lighting, angle and location, a headshot can bring people into the world of your organization!\nLighting is possibly the most important aspect when it comes to portrait photography; soft, even lighting offers the best perspective on a subject and shows the most amount of detail that matters. Appropriate lighting on the eyes and smile helps people to look at a photo more carefully.\nUsing large sources of light, like the sun or studio-type lighting, can help to achieve this look, however, the main issue with powerful lighting is controlling how it falls on a subject. Smooth out powerful light sources by using diffusion filters, such as thin silk or cloth.\nThe position of the lighting is important, too. Lights should face a subject straight on or at a slightly higher angle, but never from directly above. Even with diffusion, overhead lights can cause shadows under the eyes, nose and neck.\nPro Tip: Smooth, even lighting can be achieved by shooting outside in the shade with a bright-colored building nearby. This technique allows for light to bounce off the building and onto your subject, creating a soft light source.\nUsing the proper angle and posture for portrait photography will help make a subject look their best. Whether sitting or standing, ensure that the person’s back is straight, their shoulders are slightly relaxed and that they feel comfortable. Along with this, the camera’s position should line up with the subject’s eyes, be raised slightly, and be tilted down toward the subject. The angle should be subtle and not too extreme.\nPro Tip: Having your subject sit on or near the edge of a stool will cause them to naturally sit upright.\nFinally, location is an important element of portrait photography. Some questions to ask when determining location might be:\n- What type of backdrop works best?\n- Is there already a style or look in place?\n- Where can I tell the best story?\nThe location and background of photography can span from a backdrop, outdoor scenery or even inside an office. Each of these settings has its fair share of strengths and weaknesses, as well as an impact on the feeling of the portrait.\nUsing a backdrop will allow for a group of people to cycle through photos at a quicker rate because the factors of lighting and the background will not change as they could with another option. The consistency of the background will also create a sense of uniformity across all headshots and can be interpreted as an incredibly professional look to an audience. Typically backdrops need separate lighting to illuminate the subject and the background. The need for editing might be present depending on the style of backdrop used. However, having a complete set of photos that look identical does present organization and professionalism.\nDetermining outdoor scenery can prove difficult due to changing factors like lighting and season changes. The sun is constantly moving throughout the sky, causing changes in shadows and the best positioning for the subject. The scenery is dynamic in the way it looks, too; public places are always progressing from small details to obvious changes. Portraits with an outdoor setting give the audience a sense of location that is unique and recognizable, which is a big reason to take a photo without a staged background. Placing a subject in a setting that is meaningful to them may tell a bigger visual story than simply a headshot.\nFinally, using an indoor office as the background displays a corporate appearance with a sense of identity. Signage can be used to signify where a person works, which may be important to the photo. Because the portraits are taken inside, control of the lighting and background is easier. Using lighting to emphasize the subject and elements in the background can be taken advantage of. Keep in mind that the photos may also lose the intrigue of an outdoor setting, yet can still have a sense of uniformity similar to using a backdrop.\nPro tip: Location scouting beforehand provides context for the photographer and the chance to dial in where a photo can look its best.\nWith proper preproduction techniques and thoughtful intent, connection through imagery can be created. Tying headshots to your organization can motivate a deeper connection to your community that opens the door to engagement."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2f29ad5d-f6f1-45f0-bd2f-05550c346fa7>","<urn:uuid:23901d35-21a7-4b61-a5fd-0a702cfe09da>"],"error":null}

Presented by Bill Jividan, CSP.\"— Presentation transcript:\nWhat is a JHA and How Do I Use It? Presented by Bill Jividan, CSP\nPurpose To inform safety proponents about a very useful tool that can be used to indentify hazards and to have a plan on how to control or eliminate hazards.\nWhat is a hazard? A hazard is the potential for harm. In practical terms, a hazard often is associated with a condition or activity that, if left uncontrolled, can result in an injury or illness.\nJHA Definition OSHA defines a Job Hazard Analysis as: a technique that focuses on job tasks as a way to identify hazards before they occur. It focuses on the relationship between the worker, the task, the tools, and the work environment. A JHA is on component of the larger commitment of a safety and health management system.\nWhats the difference between JHA and JSAs? A Job Hazard Analysis should be the preliminary step to evaluating hazards associated with any job category or function. The JHA assigns risk while the JSA identifies specific hazards and provides tools to remediate the hazards.\nContinued Performing a JHA prior to a JSA is critical because it allows a company to prioritize the implementation of its workplace safety efforts.\nWhy is a JHA important? One of the best ways to determine and establish proper work procedures is to conduct a JHA. A JHA is one component of the larger commitment of a safety and health management system\nWhat value does a JHA have? JHAs help identify, eliminate and prevent hazards in the workplace. This will likely result in fewer worker injuries and illnesses, safer, more effective work methods and reduced workers compensation costs and increased worker productivity.\nWhat jobs do I use JHA on? Jobs with the highest injury or illness rates. Jobs with the potential to cause severe or disabling injuries or illness, even if there is no history of previous accidents. Jobs in which one simple human error could lead to a severe accident or injury. Jobs that are new to your operation or have undergone changes in processes and procedures. Jobs complex enough to require written instructions.\nOK, Where do I begin? Involve your employees Review your accident history Conduct a preliminary job review List, rank, and set priorities for hazardous jobs. Outline the steps or tasks.\nHow do I identify workplace hazards? What can go wrong? What are the consequences? How could it happen? What are other contributing factors? How likely is it that the hazard will occur?\nGrinding Iron Castings: Job Steps Step 1. Reach into metal box to right of machine, grasp casting, and carry to wheel. Step 2.

Presented by Bill Jividan CSP firstname.lastname@example.org","By Paul Fooks\nSpecial to Ontario Construction News\nFor this instalment, I will be discussing the Job Safety Analysis (JSA) or Job Hazard Assessment (JHA), also known as the Safe Operating Procedure (SOP). It doesn’t matter what you call it. It has the same intention. The end result of developing any one of the documents is to make a safe work plan.\nAs the old saying goes, if you fail to plan you plan to fail. In addition to the safety benefit for these safe work plans, both federal and provincial acts and regulations outline requirements for written procedures for workers. These plans are essential tasks for supervisors or employers.\nSo why are these documents so difficult to develop? For starters, some people say the process takes time out of an already busy day. The steps may need to be reviewed several times, compounding the time demands. Sometimes I hear the excuse that the job is so simple there is no need to do a safe work plan because of the obviousness of the risk and the required protective measures.\nIf the story is so simple, then you would need only to write a short JSA. In fact, the simple project would be the first JSA to develop and analyze. I will typically write Safe Operating Procedures which will incorporate the safe work plan as the procedural product in the SOP.\nSOPs incorporate regulations, references, owners manuals and technical references to complete one task.\nThe easiest starting point for the JSA/JSA is to simply observe a worker performing a task and then write down the steps to complete the procedure. I have done this using a video recording so the procedures can be looked at and stopped as needed to look at each step without getting clouded by the next steps. At each defined step, some analysis must go into the risks at each step.\nFor each risk, a control or safety measure must be identified to protect the worker.\nAs JSA example, consider the process of setting up a ladder. Step one would be to select the ladder. The risk would be a ladder too long or too short, or a ladder unsafe for the task or because there are electrical conductors nearby. This step requires the worker to determine ladder’s height, and the right type of ladder for the location.\nStep two would be to inspect the area for risks such as the supporting surface, contact point for even support, overhead hazards, fall risks, structural integrity, electrical contact, cut risks (edges, ledges, nails, bolts, rebar etc.). Survey the area for any risk and mitigate each one.\nStep 3 would be to inspect the ladder for any damage that could lead to failure in accordance with the manufacturer’s owners manual. The ladder needs to be inspected to be sure it is serviceable, and set up according to the manual.\nAs an example, folding step ladders legs are spread, spreader bars locked facing the work area, not sideways to the work. For a straight ladder, it needs to be set up with three rungs above the contact point using the 3:1-4:1 rule, secured at the top and the bottom to prevent movement.\nA final risk assessment may be to secure tools so they cannot fall, or using fall protection if you are going over three meters for projects under Ontario jurisdiction or 2.4 meters for federal workers.\nSome job sites have even lower thresholds for fall protection so make sure you know what act, regulation or policy governs your performance. These are the basic common steps for a simple JSA.\nThe preceding is a general safe work plan example, not a complete safe work plan. The main point here is you should follow the sequence, identify the steps, identify the risks, determine a safety control, and then follow the procedure. You can use many pre-made forms to follow for JSAs or create your own checklists and modify the form as you gain more experience and insight. Some situations will be more complicated but the time spent is well worth the benefits in safety.\nPaul Fooks is Ottawa-based Labor Tek Safety Training Inc.’s head trainer.

{"question":"Which causes more complications: root canal treatment or an untreated dental abscess?","answer":"An untreated dental abscess is more likely to cause complications than root canal treatment. If an abscess infection isn't treated, it can spread further into the jawbone and require tooth removal. Root canal treatment, while carrying some risks like potential damage to surrounding tissue or nerves, has a high success rate of 95%. The main side effects of root canal treatment are typically minor and temporary, including slight tenderness and swelling that resolves within two weeks. Most root canal treatments are successful at saving the tooth, while untreated abscesses inevitably lead to more severe problems requiring tooth extraction.","context":["1. When should I bring my child to the dentist for the first time?\nUsually by the age of three a child should be seen at the dental office. It is best to give your child a good experience and get them used to the dental office environment. Most of the time the fear of going to the dentist comes from waiting to go until they are in pain and then are forced to see the dentist. You want to start taking your child before that happens for several reasons. First, if they go to the dentist at an early age they will be used to going to it and will know what to expect. Also, it will prevent dental problems in the future.\n2. Why are my teeth so sensitive?\nThere are many factors that can lead to you have sensitive teeth. Including brushing too hard, receding gums, gingivitis, cracked teeth, tooth grinding, tooth whitening, plaque build up, acidic foods, your age, and recent routine dental procedures. You can reduce sensitivity by using a soft bristled tooth brush, use fluoridated dental toothpastes and rinses, and by visiting your dentist on a regular six month schedule.\n3. How do I change or cancel an appointment?\nHere at Dr. Hanlon’s office, we make every effort to make sure that we are on time for you, so all we ask is that you extend the same courtesy to us. Please call or email us at least 24 hours before your scheduled appointment to cancel it or to change it. This consideration on your part allows us to give your appointment to another patient in need of our services. Our phone number is (724)941-2200 and we can be reached by email at myappointment@drHanlon.com.\n4. I am missing one or more teeth; what are my options?\nThere are three ways to replace a missing tooth, a fixed bridge, an implant, or a denture.\n-With a fixed bridge, the teeth on either side of the missing tooth are prepared for crowns, an impression is made, and the case is sent to a dental laboratory. The laboratory then makes the crowns and adds a false tooth between the two crowns – this is a bridge, it is a permanent and is non removable.\n-Another nice way of replacing a missing tooth is to get a dental implant. A dental implant is placed directly into the bone, it is like placing an entirely new artificial tooth in your mouth. It is permanent and the adjacent teeth are not affected, it will feel like your tooth never went missing.\n-Another option would be a partial denture. We can fabricate a partial that has metal or a nylon flexible partial called a Valplast. Either one is removable and requires some extra care. The Valplast, however, fits better, looks better, and is lightweight.\nIt is important to discuss with your dentist which option is best for you and your situation.\n5. I’m terrified of going to the dentist; what can be done to lower my anxiety?\nFirst, let us know that you are apprehensive, maybe we can ease your fears and adapt the treatment around them. If it is the sound of the handpiece that bothers you, feel free to bring your music and headphones with you. If you still are anxious about an upcoming procedure, there are some medications that we can prescribe that will make you feel less uneasy. Still, if the thought of dental work completely terrifies you, we have a rapport with a company, Ambulatory Anesthesia that will come to our office to sedate you.\n6. How much will my insurance cover?\nThis is an excellent question, but not an easy one to answer. Our fees are always consistent, but it is hard to know what your individual dental benefits will be. Each dental plan is a contract between your insurance provider and your employer, because of this; no two insurance plans are alike. Most patients feel that their dental well being is important enough to go ahead with treatment, despite the benefit they will receive from their insurance. These patients find that they actually save money by addressing their dental needs in a timely fashion. They avoid more costly and invasive treatment that results from neglect. We can always negotiate a payment plan so you can still have a healthy smile without having to sacrifice your dental health to your insurance company.\n7. I have embarrassing bad breath; how can I fix it?\nThere are many reasons why you may experience Halitosis (bad breath). It could be caused by the foods that you eat. As food particles remain in the mouth, they collect bacteria and begin to rot, leaving an unpleasant odor. Tobacco use is also a cause for bad breath. Maintaining good oral health is essential in reducing bad breath. You should brush, floss, and use Listerine mouth wash often. Another way to fight bad breath is to clean your tongue! You can purchase a tongue scraper or brush your tongue with a toothbrush, and the trick is to get as far back as you can. The back of your tongue harbors odor producing bacteria, brushing this area will significantly improve bad breath odors.\n8. I have crooked teeth but I’d rather not have braces; is there anything I can do?\nDental veneers are a wonderful way to change a smile rather easily.\nDental veneers are custom-designed shells of tooth-like ceramic material that, when applied over the surface of a tooth, can cover worn tooth enamel, uneven tooth alignment or spacing and chips or cracks.\n9. Do you offer emergency care?\nYes! We understand that there’s no pain like tooth pain and make every effort to see you as soon as possible. Should a dental emergency arise don’t hesitate to call our office at anytime. We have an answering machine with Dr. Hanlon’s personal cell phone number and he can be reached at anytime.\n10. What is periodontal disease?\nPeriodontal disease is an infection in the gum tissue and bone that encases your teeth. It causes the attachment of the tooth and tissues around it to break down. There are two stages: Gingivitis, which is reversible and affects only the gums; and Periodontitis, which affects the bone and is much more destructive and can lead to the loss of your teeth. You don’t have to loose your teeth to periodontal disease. Prevention is key, include brushing and flossing twice a day in good daily hygiene routine.\n11. I would like to change all my silver fillings to tooth colored fillings; what are the benefits?\nThere is no real harm in leaving your silver (amalgam) fillings in your teeth, although the tooth colored (composite) fillings are much more esthetically pleasing. Dentists have been using silver amalgam fillings for over a century. Of course you would want to change any filling that is cracked, breaking down around the edges, or has decay around or under them.\n12. I want to whiten my teeth; what services are available and are they safe?\nAt our office we use two methods to safely whiten and brighten your teeth so you want to smile more! First, we have Opalescence, it is a carbamide peroxide gel that is placed into specially made trays fit for your mouth only. They are then worn while you sleep for two weeks with wonderful results! We also carry the Tres White bleaching system. This is a 10 day whitening system. Tres White has pre-made bleach trays with a soft edge. The difference between the two systems is that the Tres White trays are disposable.\n13. What is an abscessed tooth?\nAn abscessed tooth is an infection. An abscess can develop from tooth decay, a broken tooth, or trauma. It can include pus and swelling of the gum tissue and face and be very painful.Â Usually the only way to save a tooth once it has an abscess is to perform root canal therapy or it can be removed.\n14. Who needs to have their wisdom teeth removed?\nNot everyone will need to get their wisdom teeth extracted. But most people just don’t have the room to accommodate third molars. They are very difficult to restore with fillings because they are so far back in the mouth. They are also very hard to gain access to when its time to brush and floss them. Some people’s mouths are so small that the wisdom teeth cannot come through the bone and they become impacted. And a few lucky patients just don’t have third molars, they just never formed.\n15. I need a Root Canal and I’ve heard horror stories; are they true?\nRoot canals are associated with pain, but the truth is that root canals actually relieve the pain. The reason that a root canal is necessary is because a tooth is abscessed and usually the pus and swelling from the abscess pushes on the bone and causes the area to hurt. Once a tooth is made numb with local anesthetic, no matter what procedure is performed, you should feel no discomfort.\n16. How often should I change my toothbrush?\nYou should change your toothbrush every 6 months at least. It would be nice to replace your toothbrush and treat yourself to a new one every 3-4 months. Certainly replace your toothbrush when it begins to get worn or the bristles are splayed and brittle.\n17. I have my tongue pierced; is that bad for my dental health?\nObviously, we do not recommend any oral piercing because of the dental problems they can cause. The metal on the barbell can easily crack teeth, infection of the tongue can occur, and in severe cases the tongue can swell up blocking the airway. Please skip the metal mouth and let your pearly whites be the only fashion accessories you need!\n18. What do I do if my tooth is knocked out?\nIf your tooth is knocked out, root and all, there is a chance that it can be put back in the socket and saved. There are a few steps that must be taken to ensure that it has the best chance. First, only hold the tooth by the crown, the top part of the tooth. Next, if there is any dirt on the tooth, rinse it off under running water. Be careful not to scrub or remove any tissue that may still be left on the tooth. Completely submerge the tooth in a cup of milk and as quickly and safely as possible get to the dentist! Don’t forget to bring the tooth with you!\n19. I really don’t want any X-rays taken; do I have to have them?\nSome people opt not to have x-rays taken because they believe that they are being exposed unnecessarily to radiation. The truth is the amount of radiation you receive is VERY low due to the digital x-rays that we have in our office. They pose a much smaller risk to you than many undetected dental problems. We will go by your wishes but without proper diagnostic tools, such as x-rays, it will be difficult to diagnose and treat your dental problem.\n20. What are veneers?\nA veneer is a thin shell of porcelain made to fit over your tooth like a false fingernail, it is custom made to fit your mouth. The tooth is prepared by taking off a very thin amount of enamel, impressions are taken, and they are sent to the laboratory for fabrication. A veneer can be made to make slightly crooked teeth appear straighter, discolored teeth to appear whiter, and they can also be made to close small gaps in the teeth.\n21. What causes decay?\nDecay of a tooth occurs when acids and plaque remain on the tooth’s surface. Everyone’s mouth contains bacteria and when we eat, those bacteria in our mouth get a meal as well. The longer food sits on our teeth, the more time the bacteria have to feed on the waste generated by our food. This causes demineralization. Brushing frequently greatly helps in stopping this demineralization from taking place. Plaque that is only a few hours old will not be able to produce as much tooth demineralization as plaque which is several days old. So brush, brush, brush!\n22. What is xylitol and why is it good for my teeth?\nXylitol is a natural sweetener that is made from birch. It is found in many sugar free gums. Xylitol is also found in many foods that you eat such as raspberries, strawberries, yellow plum and endive. Most bacteria in the mouth is unable to use xylitol, this is one of the reasons why it helps to prevent cavities. Chewing a piece of gum containing xylitol after a meal or a snack will help increase the flow of saliva and help clean your teeth when you don’t have the opportunity to brush.\n23. I take Fosamax for my osteoporosis. I heard that it causes “dead jaw”; should I be worried?\nIf you take any medications, be sure to let your dentist know. Some oral medication for osteoporosis (Fosamax, Boniva, and Acotnel) and intravenous drugs as part of a cancer treatment (Aredia, Bonefos, Didronel or Zometa) in rare instances have caused osteonecrosis. This is a condition that involves severe destruction of the jaw bone. It should be known that the oral medications very rarely caused such a problem. The symptoms of osteonecrosis are pain, swelling, or infection of the gums or jaw, gums that are not healing, loose teeth, numbness or a feeling of heaviness in the jaw, drainage, or exposed bone. Most always the symptoms will occur after a dental procedure such as a tooth extraction. If you should experience any of these symptoms or any other dental symptoms, contact your dentist.\n24. What are dental sealants?\nA sealant is placed onto the back permanent molars on children soon after they have erupted to prevent dental decay. A sealant is a plastic barrier that is put into the pits and fissures on the chewing surface of the molars. Sealants are easy for the dentist to apply and only take a few minutes for each tooth. They are safe, painless, and require no drilling.\n25. What is a dental implant?\nA dental implant is a great way to fill in missing spaces in your mouth or to make loose dentures fit tightly. An implant is placed into the bone and left there for several months so the bone can grow around it locking it into place. Once the implant is stable and fused into the bone, a crown is cemented on top of the implant. When the final restoration is placed, it still must be taken care of like a regular tooth. You must brush it and floss around it. Not everyone is a candidate for dental implants though. Sometimes the bone is not ideal for the implant, the sinuses are in the way, and also patients who smoke have a higher risk of the implant failing. With an overall success rate of 95% and about 50 years of clinical research, dental implants are a wonderful way to restore the teeth in your mouth!\nIf your question wasn’t answered above please feel free to call our office and ask!","Your dentist may suggest root canal treatment if there is inflammation or infection inside one of your teeth. They will clean and fill inside the tooth to prevent further damage or infection. Root canal treatment can save your tooth from having to be taken out.\nWhat is a root canal?\nYour teeth have ‘roots’ that anchor them into your jawbone. Inside each of your teeth there is a mixture of blood vessels and nerves called pulp. Pulp sits inside a space called the pulp chamber and this extends down into the roots of the tooth. The pulp chamber within the root is called the root canal.\nWhy might I need root canal treatment?\nIf your tooth is damaged, bacteria can get inside it. This causes irritation, pain and swelling. If the pulp inside the tooth becomes infected, this can spread into the pulp inside the root canal. The aim of root canal treatment is to prevent your tooth from being taken out by removing the damaged pulp and treating the infection.\nYou may need root canal treatment for a number of reasons, including:\n⦁ Severe tooth decay\n⦁ Repeated dental treatment on the tooth\n⦁ A cracked tooth\n⦁ A broken crown\n⦁ Cracked or loose fillings and Gum disease\n⦁ An injury, such as a blow to your mouth\nIf an infection isn’t treated, it can spread further and cause an abscess, which is a collection of pus. This can be painful, tender and can cause swelling around your tooth and jaw.\nSometimes your tooth may look darker in colour than your other teeth, which means that the nerve inside your tooth is dead or dying. Without treatment, the infection may spread further into your jawbone and you may need to have your tooth removed.\nIf you’re experiencing toothache or would like to find out more information about root canal treatment, contact your dentist. We have over 350 dental practices around the UK, find your local Bupa Dental Care dentist here; we’d be happy to hear from you.\nPreparing for root canal treatment\nRoot canal treatment is done by a dentist. But if your tooth is difficult to treat, your dentist may refer you to an endodontist. This is a dentist who specialises in root canal treatment.\nYour dentist will examine you and ask about your symptoms, including any pain you’re having. They may also ask you about your medical history and any previous treatment you’ve had on your teeth. Your dentist will take an X-ray of your tooth. This can help to show which tooth is causing your pain and needs treatment, and how far any infection has spread. These examinations are necessary for your dentist to make sure that the tooth is not too badly damaged for root canal treatment.\nAlthough some root canal treatments can be completed within one appointment, most are done over two or more sessions with your dentist. Root canal treatment is usually done under local anaesthetic. This completely blocks pain from your tooth and jaw area, and you will stay awake during the procedure.\nWhat are the alternatives to root canal treatment?\nSometimes, damaged teeth can’t be repaired with root canal treatment. This is usually if your tooth is badly damaged or if you have severe gum disease which prevents your tooth from healing or being well supported after treatment. If this happens, your dentist may suggest you have the tooth removed (extracted).\nFind your local Bupa Dental Care practice\nWhat happens during root canal treatment?\nOnce the area is numb, your dentist will place a thin rubber sheet inside your mouth. This is called a dental dam and covers everything except the tooth being worked on. It helps to keep the area around the tooth clean and stop the spread of any infection.\nUsing a drill, your dentist will make a hole in the top of your tooth and remove the pulp. They will clean out the empty hole using small instruments and a liquid to irrigate and disinfect the inside of the tooth. The instruments help to make the canals a more regular shape to enable the tooth to be filled and cleaned more precisely. The irrigating liquid makes sure that all infected material is flushed out.\nOnce the tooth is clean, your dentist will fill and seal it. Unless the dentist is sure that all infection has been removed, they will put in a temporary filling. You then have a second appointment to have the tooth permanently filled.\nIf your tooth is badly worn or is at risk of further damage, your dentist may suggest having a crown fitted. This is an artificial cap that fits over your tooth. You’re more likely to need a crown if you’re having one of your back teeth treated, because these are used for chewing.\nHaving root canal treatment can be uncomfortable because you have to sit still with your mouth open for longer than you’re used to. Your dentist will make you as comfortable as possible before the procedure starts.\nWhat to expect afterwards\nAfter a local anaesthetic, it may take several hours before the feeling comes back into your jaw and face. Take special care not to bump or knock the area. You may need pain relief to help with any discomfort after the anaesthetic wears off and for the next couple of days. You can take over-the-counter painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen. Always read the patient information leaflet that comes with your medicine and if you have any questions, ask your pharmacist for advice.\nFind your local Bupa Dental Care practice\nRecovering from root canal treatment\nWhen you next need to see your dentist will depend on the reasons for your treatment and how the procedure went. Your dentist may ask you to have further X-rays and check-ups to make sure that the tooth is secure and you’re healing well.\nSome people need to have further root canal treatment if the tooth cracks or more decay develops.\nAfter your treatment, it’s important to take care of your repaired tooth. These tips will help to keep your mouth, teeth and gums healthy:\n⦁ Brush your teeth twice a day using a fluoride toothpaste\n⦁ Rinse your mouth with a mouthwash, if your dentist recommends it\n⦁ Clean in between your teeth every day, either using floss or inter-dental brushes\n⦁ Don’t smoke\n⦁ Try to limit sugary foods and drinks and only have them at mealtimes\n⦁ See your dentist regularly for check-ups\nSide-effects of root canal treatment\nYou may have some slight tenderness around the tooth that has been treated, but usually this lasts for only a short time. If you have severe pain or any pain or discomfort that gets worse, see your dentist. The area around your tooth may also be swollen and bruised. This should get better within two weeks of your treatment.\nComplications of root canal treatment\nComplications are when problems occur during or after treatment. All medical and dental procedures come with some risk. But how these risks apply to you will be different from how they apply to others. Be sure to ask for more information if you have any concerns.\nMost root canal treatment is successful, but sometimes further problems can occur. Possible complications include:\n⦁ Damage to the root canal or the tissue surrounding the tooth\n⦁ Damage to the nerves around the tooth\nIf your root canal treatment doesn’t work, you may be advised to have more treatment. This is called re-treatment. You might also need re-treatment if your symptoms return years after you’ve had root canal."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c9defaea-1bf5-480a-9e43-68d7b04bf044>","<urn:uuid:c3ddf997-337e-4344-b05f-f94c78524ad5>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do community loans and Environmental Systems minors compare in their approach to building knowledge and skills?","answer":"Community loans and Environmental Systems minors take different approaches to building knowledge and skills. Community loans focus on group-based learning and social development, promoting social capital growth and reaching well-organized poor communities for infrastructure, land, and housing projects. Meanwhile, the Environmental Systems minor requires a more structured academic approach, consisting of 28 units (20 upper-division) with a strong emphasis on natural science foundation. The minor includes specific coursework requirements like Biology 3, Math 10A-10B-10C, or Chemistry 6A-6B-6C, and students must earn at least a C- grade in most courses. While community loans aim to increase political impact and connect with formal solutions, the Environmental Systems minor focuses on developing interdisciplinary environmental problem-solving skills through formal coursework.","context":["Presentation on theme: \"Growth Housing finance Land administration chain Dr. Monika Hjeds Löfmark National Housing Credit Guarantee Board, Sweden WUF 2010.\"— Presentation transcript:\nGrowth Housing finance Land administration chain Dr. Monika Hjeds Löfmark National Housing Credit Guarantee Board, Sweden WUF 2010\nShort introduction –Growth and development Formal and informal methods of finance –Mortgages –Savings –Micro finance –Community loans –Remittances The land administration chain –Connecting the issues of land, security of tenure and housing finance Outline of presentation\nIntroduction Growth and capital –Physical –Human –Social Growth and institutions –Formal –Informal Growth and actions –Local knowledge and institutions are crucial –Do not invent the wheel twice –Gradual changes –Formal Institutional Improvements –Broad actions Growth, urbanization and housing –Housing and housing finance\nFormal mortgages Volatile macro economy Lack of (long term) capital Lack of financial infrastructure Legal system, housing market reg., credit bureau, valuations Credit risk Collaterals and income –How to include households with low and moderate income? –How to create a better infrastructure, secured ledning environment, adequate funding sources, legal systems, regulations, long term funding, insurance products etc.?\nSavings Most common financial method Prepare housholds for regular payments Increase sustainability Larger autonomy for the savers Saving clubs, mobile bankers Connected with micro finance loan and community loan High levels of inflation discourages savings –How to formalize savings without high cost for the households?\nMicrofinance Small loans, short repayment period No formal collateral Suits gradual building and improvments Reaches low and moderate income housholds Non transparent, high interest rates, and often little knowlege of formal proceedures –How to scale them up?

Gradual and broad changes Local initiatives/actions are crucial Cooperation and inspiration","Environmental Systems Program\nThe Environmental Systems Program recognizes the growing demand for environmental specialists and is designed to prepare undergraduates to enter a broad spectrum of environmental careers and graduate programs in the natural sciences, social sciences, public policy, law, and business.\nThis interdisciplinary program recognizes that local, national, regional, international, and global environmental problems do not fit neatly into traditional academic departments. A measurable part of society’s inability to effectively manage complex environmental problems stems from the lack of specialists who can apply analytical tools that cross disciplinary boundaries. Many environmental specialists possess little training in the natural sciences including both the fundamental ideas and methodologies of the earth and environmental sciences. The Environmental Systems (ESYS) major was created to address both of these shortcomings.\nThe requirements for completion of the Environmental Systems major include a lower-division core, two upper-division courses, a three-course upper-division integrating sequence (ESYS 101, ESYS 102, ESYS 103), an upper-division statistics course, advanced courses in one of four tracks, and the senior integrative project (ESYS 187A/187B) and senior seminar (ESYS 187C). Any questions concerning the requirements should be directed to the Faculty Director or the program advisors. Students completing the advanced tracks in “Earth Sciences,” “Ecology, Behavior, and Evolution,” and “Environmental Chemistry” will be awarded a B.S. in environmental systems. The B.A. In environmental systems will be granted to students completing the “Environmental Policy” track within the major.\nA grade-point average of 2.0 or higher in the upper-division major program is required for graduation. Students must receive a grade of C– or better in any course to be counted toward fulfillment of the major requirements. In exceptional cases, students with a grade-point average in the major of 2.5 or greater may petition to have one grade of D accepted. All courses must be taken for Letter Grade (except ESYS 187A and 187B).\nLinks to printable degree checklists are below.\nIf you are interested in transferring into UC San Diego as an Environmental Systems (ESYS) major, please see our ESYS Transfer Student Information.\nNOTE: The requirements for the ESYS major were updated in Fall 2017.

The program places a strong emphasis on a rigorous natural science foundation. Thus, most of the courses related to the minor have significant prerequisites; students planning an Environmental Systems minor should check catalog course description carefully.\nThe minor consists of twenty-eight units, at least twenty of which must be upper-division. Up to 2 courses for the minor may be taken on a Pass/Not Pass basis, (upper or lower division). Students must earn at least a letter grade of C- in the remaining 5 or more courses used for the minor. Students considering the Environmental Systems minor are strongly advised to meet with program advisors.\nThe minor is structured as followed:\nAny two of the following lower-division courses, if they are NOT lower-division requirements for the student’s major, may be applied to satisfy eight of the total units necessary for the minor:\n- Biology 3\n- Math 10A-10B-10C\n- Chemistry 6A-6B-6C\n- Physics 1A-AL, 1B-BL, 1C-CL\n- Environmental Systems 10\n- Environmental Studies 30\n- SIO: any lower division course\nNOTE: ESYS 102 and ESYS 103 both have significant prerequisites; students planning an Environmental Systems minor should check course descriptions and prerequisites carefully.\nAt least 2 additional upper-division courses from upper-division electives from the advanced tracks in the Environmental Systems major.

{"question":"Do both the Paschalville Library and Civic Center Plaza designs prioritize connecting their spaces to surrounding neighborhoods?","answer":"Yes, both designs emphasize neighborhood connectivity. The Paschalville Library redesign aims to connect better with its community by opening up to the main street with a new entrance and revealing existing services to local residents. Similarly, the Civic Center Plaza design specifically focuses on connecting to surrounding neighborhoods, particularly through the transformation of Leavenworth Street into a neighborhood park that serves as a welcome mat connecting the Tenderloin district to Civic Center's public spaces.","context":["In the years following 2008, the recession spurred a new movement in city planning, centered on revitalizing existing public spaces rather than building new ones. Called “tactical urbanism,” this approach supported small-scale efforts, like guerrilla gardening or pop-up parks, that can have an outsized impact on making cities more livable and enjoyable.\nRecently, tactical urbanism has attracted the attention of architects and designers with the skills and resources to scale it up–including Jeanne Gang, the MacArthur Fellow and architect behind Studio Gang in Chicago.\n“This approach is really working in regards to buildings that already exist but have fallen into disrepair,” says Gang. While architecture has long been defined by new buildings, Studio Gang is thinking sensitively about how we use and alter the buildings that we already have.\nGang and her team have long been engaged with civic revitalization efforts through one-off projects, like their 2015 Polis Station project, a proposal for turning police station into community centers as a way to increase community engagement and combat police brutality. But now, the studio is working with the Knight Foundation and Kresge Foundation to apply this type of thinking on a much larger scale, by reimagining existing community spaces in Southwest Philadelphia, like libraries, parks, and recreational centers, to fit more precisely with a city’s needs today. Alongside the foundations, they’re creating a blueprint for four other cities looking to do the same.\nThe project part of a $40 million initiative announced last week called Reimagine the Civic Commons that invests in civic buildings in American cities that have fallen into disrepair or out of productive and widespread use. Funded by the Knight Foundation, the JPB Foundation, the John S. and The Kresge Foundation and The Rockefeller Foundation, the initiative will connect architects with community leaders in cities including Akron, Chicago, Detroit, and Memphis, to revitalize the cities’ public spaces, particularly in low-income or working class neighborhoods, in an effort to reverse trends of economic and social segregation.\nStudio Gang and the foundations have been testing the concept since 2015, in a neighborhood in Southwest Philadelphia, in order to establish guidelines for the four launch cities. The foundations reached out to the studio after seeing the Polis Station on exhibition at the first annual Chicago Architecture Biennial. While Knight and Kresge had already been working in Philadelphia on the social and political aspects of the Civic Commons plan, they needed an architect to take the community’s needs and synthesize them into a practical design proposal that all cities could use.\nGang’s job was to work with the Philly government and community in the neighborhoods of neighborhoods of Elmwood and Paschalville, in Southwest Philly, to create a design proposal for how to move forward with their civic buildings and parks. The proposal will also be used as a guideline for other cities seeking to revitalize their own public spaces.\nThe result is a booklet that looks a lot like Gang’s Polis Station proposal but incorporates other civic assets like schools, libraries, parks, recreational centers, and a tweaked version of the original Polis proposal. “It turned into this middle-scale plan that could really help cities transform themselves with what they already have,” says Gang.\nLocated on the corner of a busy, tree-lined avenue in Southwest Philly, the big brick building that houses the Pascalville branch of the Philadelphia Public Library is a familiar sight. It’s one of over 1,600 libraries industry titan Andrew Carnegie funded in the U.S. between 1880 and 1930. Built in a number of different architectural styles, these buildings are historic and well-made–they’re built to last, and to withstand the weight of thousands of books each. But the utility of libraries has shifted since the Carnegie era, and Gang and her team found that some of the library’s services to the community had changed.\n“People just aren’t borrowing books to the same degree,” says Gang. “So we thought perhaps what’s more needed is to think of information as a resource regardless of the media that its held in.” In other words, libraries can still lend books but can also become technology hubs, where people can borrow things like iPhones or laptops. It can become a place for people to gather for events, network, apply for jobs–“things that it wasn’t necessarily designed for,” says Gang.\nGang and Gia Biagi, the lead designer on the project, worked with library officials and community organizers to understand their programming, but their most important role was rethinking the layout and design of the space so that it would work better for these new functions. They designed some short-term fixes that could be done immediately and with little funding, like reconfiguring the spaces for new technology, classes, and events. Others aspects of the plan will take longer, require the sign-off of city planners, and would need to tap into private and public funding.\nFor example, the architects designed a new entrance for the library that would open it up to the main street, instead of sequestered to a side street. The side street entrance becomes a gathering area and performance space, and the other side an outdoor theater.\nStudio Gang’s plan also called for turning the nearby Francis Myers Recreation Center into a Wellness Center. The building has been renovated and added to so many times over the decades, it’s now a sprawling, multi-building complex. Taking advantage of the separate but conjoined buildings, the architects imagined that some spaces could be rented-out to health providers and used as clinics or health education classrooms. The idea? If kids can get a flu shot at the same place they play basketball or go to summer camp, they’ll be more likely to get one. The architects’ proposal also suggests knocking down the walls of closed, single-purpose rooms to create more open spaces. A longer-term solution includes creating an outdoor area accessible from the gym, which could house gardens and host the city’s outdoor team activities.\nOne of the big ideas for Civic Commons is that all of these community spaces will be stronger if they are connected, rather than operating separately. In this respect, the design initiatives for encouraging exercise extend to the parks, and to the schools, where the architects designed gardens and sunlit-spaces to encourage productivity. “Parks specifically play a role in reducing trauma and reducing ADHD symptoms in kids, so the more that we can make it so people cross that threshold into a park the better,” Biagi says. “Then we can aid in that mental and emotional support system, just through the design of these public spaces.”\nAs with the library, each building on Gang’s list includes some short-term, achievable projects as well as more involved, longer-term goals. Looking to tactical urbanism for inspiration, Gang and her team included guidance in their plan for small interventions that don’t take a lot of capital investment. And for those, they found, there were a lot of programs already put in place by people who live and work in the neighborhood–the architects just needed to support them by making these programs more obvious to other members of the community.\nA transformation had already been underway at the library, for example, where people were increasingly coming to find the resources needed to apply for jobs. The branch has a service that lends ties for interviews, though not many people in the community knew about it. Part of the rationale behind redesigning the entrance was to reveal these existing services to the residents they were meant to support.\n“It’s important to note that it’s not all failing in Southwest Philly,” says Gang. “There are seeds of things that are working, so that’s what our work was to do–not just come in and say ‘this is broken,’ but also to see the potential of the things that the local people already know work and amplify their message and make a synergistic relationship with the architecture that they already have.”\nWorking with people who are already there, with systems already in place, and with buildings already constructed, is a key part of Gang’s philosophy, and the only way that intervention can really work. It’s also not the most natural mode of operation for architects, who are used to engaging with city officials, but not necessarily on the street level with the people they are building for.\n“It’s not necessarily something [architects] learn how to do in design school and it maybe it seems intimidating to be so directly engaged with the community,” Gang says. “People might think that it would hinder creativity, but which we’ve discovered it actually really incited creativity because people are collaborating and getting excited. It’s this whole process of engaging with people directly at the very early stages that is helping transform the process of urban design.”\nCorrection: In a previous version of this article, we noted that the Knight Foundation worked with Studio Gang on revitalizing Philadelphia’s civic buildings. Both the Knight and the Kresge Foundations worked with them. The article has been updated to reflect the change.\n[All Images: courtesy Studio Gang]","PUBLIC SPACE DESIGN\nUnless otherwise noted, all images on this page prepared by CMG Landscape Architecture with Kennerly Architecture + Planning and Gehl Studio. All designs are conceptual and pending further refinement.\nCivic Center is a public space for all San Franciscans: a ceremonial gathering place that welcomes everyday use and inspires civic pride.\nThe design vision for Civic Center illustrated on this page represents eighteen months of community and City stakeholder input. This vision seeks to enhance Civic Center as both a ceremonial gathering place that inspires civic pride as well as improving it as a space for daily neighborhood use. The concept plan fulfills the ambitions of the original 1912 Beaux-Arts plan: cohesion across the Civic Center Landmark District with ceremonial spaces that commemorate civic history with capacity for large demonstrations and celebrations. At the same time, it adds intimate spaces that create daily destinations and offer diverse experiences and amenities for local residents. Public space principles were developed with stakeholders throughout the plan and will serve as touchstones for the further development of the design, implementation, and management of the project as it evolves.\nCivic Center Plaza\nGarden rooms framing new lawns and the Playgrounds create a lively, verdant frame for a large gathering space centered on City Hall. A mirror fountain provides an informal place to play during the day, but can be turned off during civic events.\nLawn terraces between the Library and the Asian Art Museum provide a place to play and hang out, and are framed by benches and places to sit in sun or shade. New pavilions and seating on the Library terrace create a quiet place to people-watch.\nNote on Pioneer Monument: This concept design studies the potential relocation of the Pioneer Monument elsewhere within the Civic Center Historic District. A decision has not been made whether to relocate the Monument, and if so, where to relocate it to. No such decision will be made prior to full analysis of the Civic Center Public Realm Plan through a public review process, including compliance with the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). At the end of that process, the City may decide to keep the Pioneer Monument in its current location or to move it to another location within the district.\nLeavenworth is transformed from forlorn alley to neighborhood park with a dog park, fitness park, community message board, and game tables. Dramatic lighting marks the gateway day and night, and special paving reinvigorates the space as a welcome mat that connects the Tenderloin to Civic Center's public spaces.\nAdaptation of the existing fountain provides visibility, planting, accessible and usable space, and productive stormwater function, transforming a barrier into an amenity to the neighborhood and a welcoming gateway. A civic promenade from Market St to City Hall is a space for commemoration of the UN Charter, the history of Civic Center, and of local/neighborhood heroes. New places to eat and recreate on Leavenworth St and at BART add vitality at the plaza’s edges."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1f959a8c-7076-4fcd-9759-1835de9d822c>","<urn:uuid:32958d7b-ad53-485c-91fe-9e5a391c248f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As an environmental scientist, I'd like to know: How do oyster reefs in Louisiana and North Carolina compare in terms of their ecosystem benefits?","answer":"Both Louisiana and North Carolina oyster reefs provide similar key ecosystem services. They both function as critical habitat for marine life - Louisiana reefs support species like blue crab, gulf menhaden and anchovies, while North Carolina reefs serve as habitat for juvenile fish. In both states, the reefs act as buffers against storm and wave energy for shoreline protection. Additionally, both regions' oyster reefs provide water quality maintenance through filtration of water. However, North Carolina has experienced a more documented decline, with oyster populations decreasing by 50-90% since the early 1900s due to overharvesting, disease, poor water quality and habitat loss.","context":["Restoration of three-dimensional shell habitats in coastal Louisiana presents a valuable and potentially self-sustaining approach to providing shoreline protection and critical nekton habitat and may contribute to water quality maintenance. The use of what has been called “living shorelines” is particularly promising because in addition to the hypothesized shoreline protection services, it is predicted that, if built and located in viable sites, these living shorelines may ultimately contribute to water quality maintenance through filtration of bivalves and may enhance nekton habitat. This approach, however, has not been tested extensively in different shallow water estuarine settings; understanding under what conditions a living shoreline must have to support a sustainable oyster population, and where these reefs may provide valuable shoreline protection, is key to ensuring that this approach provides an effective tool for coastal restoration. This project gathered preliminary data on the sustainability and shoreline stabilization of three large bioengineered fringing reefs located in Grand Isle, Lake Eloi, and Lake Fortuna, Louisiana. We collected preconstruction and postconstruction physiochemical and biological data by using a before-after-control-impact approach to evaluate the effectiveness of these living shoreline structures on reducing marsh erosion, enabling reef sustainability, and providing other ecosystem benefits. Although this project was originally designed to compare reef performance and impacts across three different locations over 2 years, delays in construction because of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill resulted in reefs being built from 12 to 18 months later than anticipated. As a result, monitoring postconstruction was severely limited. One reef, Grand Isle, was completed in March 2011 and monitored up to 18 months postcreation, whereas Lake Eloi and Lake Fortuna reefs were not completed until January 2012, and only 8 months of postconstruction data are available. Data for the latter two sites thus reflect only the 2012 spring/summer seasons, which were further impacted by a direct hit by Hurricane Isaac in August 2012, which resulted in shoreward movement of approximately 14 percent of the bioengineered structures at Lake Fortuna. Given the shortened monitoring timeframe and significant differences in construction schedules, we were not able to provide a full postconstruction assessment of the sites or a full comparison of site success based on local site characteristics. Because many of the impacts that were identified for monitoring reflect long-term processes, results and data presented should be interpreted cautiously. Sustainable oyster reefs require recruitment, growth, and survival at a rate that keeps pace with mortality and shell disarticulation. Although one site failed to recruit (establishment plus survival > 50 millimeters [mm]) over two spawning seasons, two sites only had 6 months postconstruction data available for assessment. Although there are good data on the requirements for oyster growth, there is limited explicit information on the site-specific water quality, hydrodynamic, and biological interaction effects that may determine successful reef establishment. Furthermore, interannual variability can significantly affect reef establishment, and our shortened timeframe of sampling (less than one spawning season for two of the reefs; two spawning seasons for one reef), combined with a lack of prerestoration monitoring data, limit our ability to draw any conclusions about long-term reef sustainability. Bioengineered reefs are thought to provide some benefits to shoreline stabilization through their structure by immediately attenuating wave energies and directly reducing erosion rates at shorelines sheltered by the reefs but also by increasing sediment deposition behind the reefs. Preliminary data indicate differences in reef impact by site; given the short timeframe of postconstruction data at two of the sites, and differences in reef placement between sites, however, it is difficult to draw any conclusions. Longer-term data collection and further analyses comparing reef placement; local wind, wave energy, sediment transport processes; and local bathymetry may help in parameterizing sites where fringing reefs may be most beneficial for shoreline protection. In addition to basic reef sustainability and shoreline stabilization, we measured both water quality parameters and nekton abundances around the newly created reefs and adjacent reference sites. Within the timeframe of monitoring, no effect of reefs on water quality was detected at any site. Given that water quality effects are hypothesized to result from the filtration activities of bivalves, and reefs either failed to recruit (settlement plus survival to > 50 mm) or successfully recruited but only had a couple months of growth prior to this report, it was not expected that an effect would be detectable in this timeframe. Nekton such as blue crab, gulf menhaden, and anchovies were found to be more abundant on the reefs; larger, more transient species were not found to be affected by reef presence. Future work examining smaller organisms and juveniles, including more explicit studies examining why and how these organisms preferentially use oyster reefs, would be useful in the design of other bioengineered reefs and help in understanding the role of the reefs in supporting the nekton community. It is clear from the initial work that ensuring correct site selection by better understanding what local site factors influence oyster populations is key to establishing successful living shoreline reefs. Ultimately, the success of the reefs in providing any ecosystem service relies on their ability to build a viable oyster population that is self-sustaining over the long term. As many of the ecosystem processes hypothesized to result from reefs develop over the long term (4–6 years), some level of monitoring over the next few years is highly recommended in order to accurately assess the long term viability of the reefs, their provision of ecosystem services, and to provide better guidance for future projects.\nAdditional publication details\nUSGS Numbered Series\nPreliminary assessment of bioengineered fringing shoreline reefs in Grand Isle and Breton Sound, Louisiana","Above: Sarah Poulin, left, and Anna Windle used drones to survey oyster reefs in the Rachel Carson Estuarine Research Reserve in Beaufort, N.C.\nOyster reefs play an essential role in coastal and estuarine environments. They provide a suite of ecosystem services, such as providing habitat for juvenile fish, serving as buffers to storm and wave energy, filtering pollutants from the water, and much more.\nThey’re also pretty tasty. Oysters have been harvested for consumption for centuries. However, today water people in North Carolina only bring in 15 to 20 percent of what was once harvested annually.\nHow come? Since the early 1900s, North Carolina’s oyster population has declined by an estimated 50-90 percent due to overharvesting, disease, poor water quality and habitat loss, according to N.C. Coastal Federation. Vast stretches of coast-hugging, or fringing, oyster reefs have disappeared, leaving fishermen, conservationists and others concerned about the sustainability of their populations.\nIn response to the decline, in 2001 the N.C. Division of Marine Fisheries (DMF) implemented management plans and restrictions designed to limit overharvesting. The agency based these new plans and restrictions on the results of a decades-long mapping project. In 1988, DMF began using GPS and geographical information systems, or GIS, to delineate and map habitat types in every estuarine ecosystem in the state.\nOne of the goals was to determine area and abundance of shellfish, including oysters. Thirty years later, the agency has mapped 90 percent of bottom-dwelling shellfish in those estuarine ecosystems.\nNow that baseline mapping efforts of these estuarine ecosystems has been achieved, a quicker and more efficient method is critical to continue monitoring of important shellfish species, such as oysters. A lot can change in three decades, including oyster health, abundance, and the area they cover.\nIn recent years, managers have used aerial imagery from satellites and occupied aircraft to monitor oyster reefs over time. One advantage of these remote-sensing techniques is that they don’t disturb the landscape. However, low-resolution images from sensors on occupied aircraft and satellites can leave out smaller-scale patches of oysters and can inaccurately classify similar-looking habitat types. These methods also can be costly and time-sensitive, and they’re reliant on clear weather.\nUnoccupied aircraft systems (UAS), or drones, are transforming the way we collect scientific data. They bridge the gap between sampling in the field and established remote-sensing approaches. Drones can collect significantly higher-resolution imagery, enabling us to see fine details, such as small oyster reef patches.\nWith increasing battery life and advancements on platforms and sensors, we can now collect thousands of centimeter-scale resolution images of an environment during a 45-minute drone flight across close to 3,000 acres. While established methods can measure to the nearest meter of an oyster reef, drone imagery has the ability to measure individual oysters to the nearest millimeter.\nFor our project, funded by a N.C. Sea Grant/Space Grant joint fellowship, we used drones to collect data on oyster reefs located in the Rachel Carson Estuarine Research Reserve in Beaufort, North Carolina. We explored different types of drone platforms, sensors and processing options to determine which were the most effective for oyster reef monitoring.\nWe studied intertidal fringing reefs located on the east end of Town Marsh, an island portion of the reserve, as well as manmade intertidal reefs in Middle Marsh, an area of interconnected marshland located on the west side of the reserve.\nAll of the aircraft provided hundreds of high-resolution images. When we got back to the lab, we used a processing software that stitches the images together to form a highly accurate photo representation of an area, known as an orthomosaic. The orthomosaic was geometrically corrected and aligned to a known coordinate system.\nUsing elevation measurements, the software can also create digital surface models — maps that represent the earth’s surface, including all objects on it. These maps allowed us to analyze the entire area we surveyed.\nReef area and height are widely used metrics for oyster reef monitoring. Using the high-resolution orthomosaic, we delineated the edges of oyster reef patches in order to calculate total oyster reef area. Using the digital surface model, we calculated oyster reef height. We calculated these metrics for a one-square-mile area in just a matter of minutes.\nBrandon Puckett, research coordinator for the N.C. Coastal Reserve, had informed us that managers at the Rachel Carson Reserve did not have an accurate estimate of oyster reef habitat in its total 2,315 acres. In a couple days, we were able to identify 11.83 total acres of intertidal oyster reef from analyzing drone imagery of the entire reserve.\nThis research will undoubtedly transform the way researchers and managers monitor oyster reef habitat. As our advisor, David W. Johnston of the Duke University Marine Laboratory, noted in a recent article appearing in Annual Reviews of Marine Science, “Drones are poised to revolutionize marine science and conservation, as they provide essentially on-demand remote sensing capabilities at low cost and with reduced human risk.”\nMethods involving UAS are quicker, more accurate and less environmentally disturbing than traditional, time-consuming field methods. We hope that the results from our research — which we plan to submit for publication — will help managers and researchers alike to choose the best type of aircraft and sensor for their intended purpose.\nFor more on this project, check out this interactive story map.\nFor more on the drones used in this project, visit North Carolina Space Grant.\nAfter earning master’s degrees in environmental management, Anna and Sarah are continuing to pursue more research opportunities. Anna is now a doctoral student at the University of Maryland Center for Environmental Science at Horn Point Laboratory in Cambridge, where she uses satellite and UAS remote-sensing methods to assess water quality of the Chesapeake Bay. Sarah Poulin is currently a research associate for the Marine Geospatial Ecology Lab at the Duke Marine Lab, with plans to apply to a doctoral program next fall.\nThis article was updated on Nov. 13, 2018, to reflect the following correction: The students used a DJI S900 drone, not a Matrice 600, as originally stated."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4cbcb78b-c99e-40da-8f74-71131c19b3a3>","<urn:uuid:4f77bdc1-cdab-404c-ae91-bf43a685bc7a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the 2018 album 'Wut Wut' by Dillon Francis and the 2016 album 'Loom' by Soukie & Windish differ in their creative development processes?","answer":"The albums followed distinctly different development paths. 'Wut Wut' evolved from an initial concept of using Spanish one-shots similar to 'Get Low' into a full collaborative project, featuring various Latin artists and recorded across multiple locations including New York City, Miami, Mexico City, and the Dominican Republic. The album was executive produced by Toy Selectah and aimed to create a cohesive project drawing from Francis's decade of experience. In contrast, 'Loom' was developed through a methodical process where Soukie & Windish would work on multiple tracks simultaneously, with Nayan programming arrangements while Fritz jammed with equipment. They refined their tracks over weeks, and completed the final mix-down at Tobi Neumann's Riverside Studios in Berlin to achieve an organic, wider sound.","context":["Best known for his arena-caliber EDM and bombastic bass drops, Los Angeles-born DJ-producer Dillon Francis has a long and storied history with Latin music. He began releasing mostly dubstep tracks in 2010, when the then-nascent moombahton genre — which combines electro-house with Latin-tinged reggaeton beats — first took the Internet by storm. Francis then notched his first major hit in 2011 via “Que Que,” a Spanish-language track alongside mentor and frequent collaborator Diplo, featuring Dominican-American artist Maluca. Fast-forward to 2018, and Francis has reached the cusp of a new career chapter: Dillon Francis, Latin pop crossover star.\nSeptember 28th sees the release of Wut Wut, Francis’ second full-length project and his first (mostly) Spanish-language album. Executive produced by Mexican EDM vet Toy Selectah, Wut Wut features a cast of collaborators from across the Latin pop spectrum including Ximena Sariñana, iLe of Calle 13 fame, Lao Ra, De La Ghetto and others. As the follow-up to his 2014 debut, Money Sucks, Friends Rule, the new album sees Francis expanding his production palette into sounds sweeping pop radio: from his moombahton roots on the club-ready “BaBaBa” featuring Young Ash, to rugged Latin trap on “Ven” featuring Arcángel and Quimico Ultra Mega.\nRecorded in New York City, Miami, Mexico City and the Dominican Republic, Wut Wut comes during the height of today’s Latin pop explosion, which has shepherded multiple crossover hits across mainstream genres. EDM is one of the latest industries to ride the Latin pop wave: Steve Aoki’s track, “Azukita,” features reggaeton king Daddy Yankee, Latin trap duo Play-N-Skillz and merengue icon Elvis Crespo; while David Guetta‘s new album, 7, features two tracks with J Balvin, including the Spanish-language “Para Que Te Quedes.”\nBut as Francis puts it, Wut Wut is no basic bandwagon fare. Rather, it’s his way of paying homage to the sounds that gave him everything. “Latin music is a part of what I do,” he tells Rolling Stone. “I’ll never not be making moombahton.” Rolling Stone spoke with the American producer about his latest venture into Latin pop and Latin music’s ongoing influence on his career.\nFirst of all, you grew up in L.A. Do you speak Spanish?\nUhhh … más o menos (more or less). [Laughs]\nSo then there’s a potential that you don’t know what the singers are singing about on your new album.\nYes, but there’s a reasoning behind it. Whenever I would get in the studio with anyone that spoke English, anytime they would ask me for any advice, I would give them the most horrible advice on what to sing. When I got in the studio with most of the people [for Wut Wut], they would tell me what they’re talking about and then I would say, “Hey, can you sing it this way?” Rather than telling them what to sing about, it would just be more like melody and production, so it was more of using their voice like another instrument.\nWhat were some of your earliest memories with Latin music, especially for someone like you who grew up in Los Angeles?\nI definitely remember the Cadillacs from Training Day just blasting reggaeton. I feel like that was like the most cliché thing to happen in Los Angeles, just an amazing lowrider playing a Daddy Yankee song or something. Growing up in West L.A., you just hear it all the time. But I never really deep dove into the music until I found this dude Munchi‘s music on SoundCloud. That was when I was starting to become a music producer. Then I started seeing this little tag called “moombahton.” When I started hearing it, I was like, “Oh my God!” I’m trying to DJ, I don’t know what tempo this is. It just sounds incredible — I need to see what’s happening. I had a house record called “Masta Blasta” … I put it up on SoundCloud, I sent it to Munchi. I was like, “Alright, this is the genre for me.” There [were] no rules yet and the community was so tight because there [weren’t] a lot of producers doing it. That’s really where I started deep diving into the sounds and everything with it.\nThe album has a long history, dating back to the 2016 Latin Grammys where you met De La Ghetto and Latin alternative producer El Guincho. How does the initial sketch of Wut Wut compare to the final product?\n[Originally], we weren’t even going to get a lot of vocals on it. It was gonna be like one-shots in Spanish, like doing “Get Low” in Spanish. We hit up Toy Selectah. He got a bunch of one-shots, but he also got a bunch of verses from people. From that, it kind of just started turning into something else. There [were] no expectations. The whole record was just to go have fun again and have a great time making music.\nEven before that, Wut Wut traces back to your 2011 Westside! EP, which features “Que Que,” one of your biggest moombahton hits and one of your earliest Spanish-language tracks. What’s the connection between Westside! and Wut Wut?\nThe record “BaBaBa” with Young Ash [off Wut Wut] is the closest record to what “Que Que” was when I was making it. I’ve made songs like “Anywhere” and “Coming Over” [with Kygo], where they have more melodic sensibilities. It was taking that and trying to put it into a project that actually is cohesive. If you listen to my last album, that is the most non-cohesive project ever. That’s where I was like, “I need to focus and make everything sound like they actually exist in one project.” That’s what I felt like I did with Wut Wut, where it was like honing in on everything that I’ve learned in the past 10 years of touring and making music and trying to make a cohesive album that has a great concept.\nAre you now noticing an EDM-Latin pop crossover trend?\nI guess so. I’m not trying to say, “Hey, I’m the first one that was doing it before it became a thing.” But I’ve been doing it since 2012, and I was just kind of going back to it. When we were working on [Wut Wut], “Despacito” and “Mi Gente” didn’t exist yet. Neither did “Sorry” with Justin Bieber, which I feel like was a big catalyst. A lot of my fans will always be like, “It sucks that moombahton’s dead.” And it’s funny because every single pop record in the past year has been a reggaeton/moombahton record, with like a melodic vocal drop. If anything, it’s like the most thriving genre possible right now. Mine was just going back to having fun and working with artists that I thought were just going to heighten the project and understand what the project was.\nSo this album is in no way hopping on the bandwagon of the Latin pop explosion?\nI never really wanted to say that, but I feel like people could see that if they look at my history of music. But [before] I put out the first record [off the album], “Ven,” I had literally cleared out my Instagram to two things: a picture with Arcángel from back when we worked on the record and then the other one was a video with Toy Selectah and I in the studio with De La Ghetto and El Guincho working on the records, and it was [dated] like November 4, 2016. So I was trying to lightly do that. [There have] definitely been people calling me out, being like, “Dude, you’re jumping on the bandwagon, man. You’re trying to be like ‘Despacito.'” If you listen to the album, none of it sounds like “Despacito.” It literally all sounds like my music.\nYour brand and your image have been tied to a lot of aspects related to Latin culture, from your history with moombahton to your social media character, Gerald the Piñata. You even brought out a mariachi band at Lollapalooza earlier this year. Have you ever faced any backlash from the Latin community or other groups for using such staples of their culture?\nNo. It’s pretty nuts that I haven’t, to be honest. When I was in Mexico promoting “We the Funk” [featuring singer Fuego], everyone was like, “Thank you so much for making music in Spanish, thank you for pushing the music.” That’s really what the whole project was about: to show people where I originally got [inspiration] from. Moombahton is reggaeton meets dance music, and that’s why I wanted to work with Spanish [-language] artists, so that people could understand that this is where the music came from. So if anything, I’m just trying to give back to where a lot of my success came from.\nWhen you look back, what role would you say moombahton and Latin music have had on your overall career?\nI’ve always gone back to it. I like taking a break from it because I do produce it so much. But I always want to try to bring something fresh back when I go into it, because it’s such a fun [sound]. It’s one of those things where [if] it’s just the perfect setting, it goes off.\nWill we see more Latin albums or Spanish-language albums from you in the future?\nLatin music is a part of what I do. I’ll never not be making moombahton. And I’ve definitely been working with other artists as well, where it’s working on records just for them to put out. I’m definitely gonna be doing a lot more production stuff for Latin artists, which is something I never thought that people would be coming to me for.","Music | Bittles’ Magazine: The music column from the end of the world\nIn the over-saturated world of electronic music it takes a lot to stand out from the crowd. Yet, this is something Berlin duo Soukie & Windish manage with ease, ably injecting a sense of melody, humour and personality into everything they do. So, if you ever start to feel as if you can’t take another rigid 4/4 beat, faceless techno loop, or by-the-numbers bassline, then the music of Fritz Windish and Nayan Soukie could well be the cure you seek. With releases on labels such as Liebe Detail, Audiomatique and Connaisseur to their name, their signature sound is rich, emotional, groovy and deep. By JOHN BITTLES\nThis May Soukie & Windish make a very welcome return with the loose textures, playful melodies, and spacious grooves of their sophomore album Loom. Tracks such as Jaglion, St. Tropitz, Heads Up My Dear and Dexter’s Vertigo seem to, almost, leap out of the speakers, daintily perching themselves on your knee, and singing the type of random nonsense you always wanted to hear. Deep, focused and melodic, the record finds the duo creating nine long, spacious tracks which don’t so much seduce the listener as make a true believer of them. Perfectly mixing the downbeat, the banging, the beautiful and the strange, Loom is one of those rare things, a house album you simply have to listen to from beginning to end.\nWith the record having been on repeat rotation on my headphones these last few weeks I was curious to know a bit more about the creators of these songs. In the following interview the duo discuss Loom, their record label URSL, how they met, touring and lots more. And, if you desire a funky-assed soundtrack for your reading needs then I can heartily recommend these snippets of Loom.\nBy way of introduction, can you tell us a bit about who you are and what you do?\nSoukie Windish – Berlin – ursl – techno\nYour new album Loom is out on the 13th of May. Why do we all need it in our lives?\nI think there is no music that everybody needs, it’s for people who like pads and great spaces. Our album has a really special mood, it’s mysterious, ghostly and warm music. LOOM is really a good soundtrack for a big city street, or Berlin’s‘ dirty subways. It contains deepness and melody without being cheesy at all.\nIf you had a stall in Camden Market to sell the album what would your pitch be?\nThe original painting of the artwork Another Fool On The Hill by Michael Conrads in the background, it’s massive and very impressive. Friendly selling people in elegant shabby clothes. Some stations with headphones. A lot of candles.\nWhat part of Loom are you most proud of, and why?\nWe love the part, when in St. Tropitz the bass starts, it’s perfectly introduced and when it comes it’s exactly how it has to be!\nFitzroy is a lush and evocative opener, its hushed bass pads and mournful strings conjuring vivid mental images. When you were working on it did you always know it was going to be the album’s opening track?\nNo, we discussed the track listing for a long time. It could have been also St. Tropitz, because it takes a long time to start. Or Dexter’s Vertigo. This tracklist was the first intuitive order and in the end we decided to take it, because it’s the best order for listening to all tracks together in one chain.\nOne of the early highlights for me is the slow-build synth drama of St. Tropitz. Can you tell us a bit about how this track came about?\nThat’s a hard question to answer. We always start with an idea, (which we) present to each other, if we both like it we develop it further. After a while we start an arrangement and figure out if the track works and how we have to combine the parts. We started to develop the ideas in Australia, so we had no analog synthesizers there; we tried out the Ableton push controller a lot. The staccato grove of the samplesynth is a typical sound of the controller combined with Ableton, simpler and lfo. The other hornsound is a cheap digital modular synth which is amazing for one typical monophonic sound.\nSo mostly we work like this: Nayan starts to program the arrangements, while Fritz jams with his stuff to the different parts; if something sounds great on special parts, we record it. If we like the work, we open the project again and again over days and weeks till we are finished. We produce always on different tracks at the same time and switch between them.\nSongs such as Jaglion, Cable Gardens and Head Up My Dear are gorgeously deep and will work wonders in any club. What’s the secret to creating depth in your tracks?\nThe secret is simply one’s taste, ears and experience in sound. We are working together for such a long time and know which atmosphere we want to create. To choose the right synths and samples are very important when you start a track or an idea!\nThe final mix-down for the album was done at Tobi Neumann’s Riverside Studios in Berlin. In what ways did working in this studio affect your sound?\nThe super good equipment and a good mixer makes everything sound better. And it helps you so much to decide which sound is really needed and which is not, when you really hear it. Its hard to explain but of course it sounds more organic and bigger, wider. That was our wish: to make the album sound great and not to sound pumpy.\nAre you planning on touring the album at all?\nYes, full on. Here are some dates… UK is still missing ;-)\n14.05. Sektor Evolution, Dresden\n20.05. Rote Sonne, München\n28.05. Kater Blau, Berlin\n04.06. KB18, Kopenhagen\n10.06. tba, Stockholm\n11.06. Open Air, Stockholm\n17.06. Zukunft, Zürich\n18.06.

Bahnwärter Thiel, München\n03.09. Hangar 11, Winterthur\n17.09. Dr Vogel, Osnabrück\nDo you have anything special planned for this?\nFor this tour we are doing our DJ back 2 back set, with outboard effects and sounds. But we are currently working on our live set and do shows only on special request. No big stages, only venues where we feel very comfortable and where the sound and the crowd fit to us. We want to develop a real live set which we can play over years and develop it constantly. We want to put the best parts of our productions over the last years together and improvise with them, to avoid to get bored after one tour and it must work more like a flexible DJ set.\nThe album is released on your own label URSL Records. What made you set up your own record label?\nThe first impulse 5 years ago, was that the Bachstelzen from Fusion Festival wanted to start a label and Sebo & Madmotormiquel contacted Fritz, who had already some experience managing the labels from Stephan Bodzin and Oliver Huntemann back in the days. We wanted to give our Artist network a platform to release their music. URSL is constantly changing, we are not a concept label. We are releasing music that we like, it can be slo mo, pop, electronic, or banging techno. We go with the flow of our artists.\nWhat have been the key releases for the label so far?\nOf course our first album A Forest which was also the first LP on URSL, then we had last year the debut album from Nico Stojan, Twisted Manners. Our EP series are very diverse, but we are underground music and never had a real hit on our label so far. Everyone should check our back-stock and will find nice stuff from: Schlepp Geist, Krink, Lake People, NU, Mira, Chris Schwarzwälder…\nWhat can we expect from URSL Records in 2016?\nRight now we have the remix package from Nico Stojan’s album with remixes from, Thugfucker, Adana Twins, Guillaume & Coutu Dumonts for example. Krink is coming up with his new EP Transit. A solo release from Nayan Soukie and our compilation series URSL Superhits…with very special tracks.\nAlso check out our sub-label URS for some really experimental and more darker techno experience.\nYour first EP came out way back in 2008. How did you two first meet and what made you decide to work together to create music?\n2001 in a bar in Bremen, where we both studied.\n“Hey what is your name?”\n“What is this for a shitty name!”\n“So what is yours then?“\n“People who live in glass houses should not throw stones”\nShortly after, Nayan moved into Fritz‘ community student house, Nayan producing Hip Hop, Fritz singing Reggae…but in separate rooms :-). Fritz spent some time in Argentina and experienced his first raves, Nayan did the same in Bremen in illegal warehouse parties. Back together we started off location parties, we got into the music and then played the warm up sets. The next step was our own floor at Fusion Festival. The production started in between in bathrobes and Prosecco in our living room. Slowly and constantly, learning by doing.\nYou started out as DJs. What is the secret to rocking a club?\nGet there before, feel the dancefloor, have some shots…loads of water. Secret weapons, edits and own productions combined with live delays and reverbs!\nWhat five records are working for you right now?\n- Konrad Black – Scorched Earth (Barac Interpretation)\n- Orlando Voorn – Gain Upwards (Efdemin Remix)\n- Kotelett & Zadak – Nova Zembla (dub version)\n- Kontext – Gazotron (B Lous Remix)\n- Dj Aroma – Beautifooled (Soukie & Windish Remix)\nDo you have any final words for our readers?\nA party is just a party is just a party. Take good care of each other and love the music not the hype.\nLoom is available to buy now in all good download stores and record shops. Trust me, if you haven’t heard it yet, then you are missing a treat.\n| JOHN BITTLES\n| Photos: DAVID ULRICH"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e0eba87a-2fc5-4425-ad54-5ac57def8a13>","<urn:uuid:0240d368-e7c4-4bfb-b868-9fd8ae341a9a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the main causes of growth plate injuries in young athletes, and what are the key elements of a proper warm-up to prevent them?","answer":"Growth plate injuries in young athletes commonly occur from acute events like falls during running or playing, with competitive sports accounting for one-third of all injuries. They can also result from overuse in activities like gymnastics, long-distance running, or baseball pitching. As for prevention through proper warm-up, it's essential to perform dynamic warm-up activities before strenuous exercise. Professional athletes demonstrate this by doing activities like using elastic bands for shoulder warm-up or skipping rope before practice sessions. Additionally, athletes should always avoid playing when very tired or in pain, as this can lead to injury.","context":["Additional Exercise Techniques\nThe core of the body has received a great deal of attention in the past few years; more and more, strength coaches are linking core strength with athletics performance. But what is the core and why is it important?\nCircuit Training for Tennis\nCircuit training is a method of exercising that involves “stations” where calisthenics, machines, free weights, or plyometrics can be used. This system of training is actually a form of interval training. The system usually relies on “timed” bouts of exercise, although traditional sets/repetitions may also be utilized. The athlete will work at each station for a specific period of time with a measured rest or recovery period between each exercise.\nMost players and coaches are familiar with warming up and getting the body prepared to engage in a high-intensity activity. The cool-down, on the other hand, is less understood but no less important to performance. A proper cool-down is an essential part of a post-match routine and can aid a player’s physical recovery and preparation for the next practice or match.\nDynamic Warm-Up and Flexibility Training\nIf you have been to sport science presentation lately it is likely that you have heard some information about dynamic warm-up and flexibility training. This is an area of training that is receiving more and more attention in the sporting community and many of the conclusions that have been drawn about this type of warm-up are directly applicable to tennis.\nPlyometric Exercises for Tennis\nPlyometric exercises are one of the more common ways of training to develop explosive power in sport. However, there are many coaches who do not know where to begin when trying to incorporate plyometrics into a training plan.\nStrength Training for Young Players Part I\nStrength training and conditioning are becoming necessities in today’s tennis game as play continues to get faster and players hit the ball with more power from everywhere on the court. As coaches, players and parents become more aware of this, they want to get their players involved in a strength and conditioning program--often at younger and younger ages. There are a lot of questions surrounding strength training, especially when we start talking about younger players. Through a series of questions and answers, this article will look at some of the questions and dispel some of the myths surrounding youth strength training.\nStrength Training for Young Players Part II\nStrength training for children and adolescents has been a hotly debated topic over the years and there still is a great deal of misunderstanding and misinformation being circulated among coaches, players and parents on this topic. Common questions that are asked regarding strength training are \"Will the player develop big muscles?\", \"Will athletic performance improve?\", \"Is strength training safe?\", and \"Is a growth plate injury or stunted growth a possible side effect of strength training?\"\nTennis Specific Drills to Improve Quickness on Court\nWhat’s the best way to help your players improve their tennis? By playing and practicing tennis skills of course. Therefore, much of the training for tennis should be sport specific. Especially when it comes to footwork. Many players work on their movement and footwork skills, but to have the best results they should emulate the particular movements that they will be performing during a match. I have selected some of the top movement drills used by professionals as well as many of our very best nationally ranked junior players.\nLike many of you, when I attend a tennis tournament I spend most of my time watching players practice with their coaches. This years US Open was no exception. One of the interesting things to watch is how players warm-up prior to practice. This year, I saw Gustavo Kuerten use elastic bands to warm up his shoulder before he ever hit a ball, and Jelena Dokic skip rope for 5-10 minutes before she walked on the court to start a practice session. While each player uses his or her own methods, the common factor is that all of these players do some type of warm-up before they do anything strenuous on the court.","GROWTH PLATE INJURIES\nGrowth Plate Injuries\nWhat is the growth plate?\nThe growth plate, also known as the physis, is the area of developing tissue near the end of the long bones in children and adolescents. Each long bone has at least two growth plates: one at each end. The growth plate determines the future length and shape of the mature bone. When growth is complete-sometime during adolescence-the growth plates are replaced by solid bone.\nWho gets growth plate injuries?\nThese injuries occur in children and adolescents. The growth plate is the weakest area of the growing skeleton, weaker than the nearby ligaments and tendons that connect bones to other bones and muscles. In a growing child, a serious injury to a joint is more likely to damage a growth plate than the ligaments that stabilize the joint. An injury that would cause a sprain in an adult can be a potentially serious growth plate injury in a young child.\nMost injuries to the growth plate are fractures. Growth plate fractures comprise 15 to 30 percent of all childhood fractures. They occur twice as often in boys as in girls, with the greatest incidence among 14-year-old boys and 11- to 12-year-old girls. Older girls experience these fractures less often because their bodies mature at an earlier age than boys'. As a result, their bones finish growing sooner, and growth plates are replaced by stronger, solid bone.\nGrowth plate fractures occur most often in the long bones of the fingers (phalanges), followed by the outer bone of the forearm (radius) at the wrist. These injuries also occur frequently in the lower bones of the leg: the tibia and fibula. They can also occur in the upper leg bone (femur) or in the ankle, foot, or hip bone.\nWhat causes growth plate injuries?\nWhile growth plate injuries can be caused by an acute event, such as a fall or a blow to the body, they can also result from overuse. For example, a gymnast who practices for hours on the uneven bars, a long-distance runner, or a baseball pitcher perfecting his curve ball can all have growth plate injuries.\nIn one large study of growth plate injuries in children, the majority resulted from a fall, usually while running or playing on furniture or playground equipment. Competitive sports, such as football, basketball, softball, track and field, and gymnastics, accounted for one-third of all injuries. Recreational activities, such as biking, sledding, skiing, and skateboarding, accounted for one-fifth of all growth plate fractures, while car, motorcycle, and all-terrain-vehicle accidents accounted for only a small percentage of fractures.\nWhether an injury is acute or due to overuse, a child who has pain that persists or affects athletic performance or the ability to move or put pressure on a limb should be examined by a doctor. A child should never be allowed or expected to \"work through the pain.\"\nHow to prevent sports injuries*\n- Be in proper physical condition to play a sport.\n- Know and abide by the rules of the sport.\n- Wear appropriate protective gear (for example, shin guards for soccer, a hard-shell helmet when facing a baseball pitcher, a helmet and body padding for ice hockey).\n- Know how to use athletic equipment (for example, correctly adjust the bindings on snow skis).\n- Always warm up before playing.\n- Avoid playing when very tired or in pain.\n* Reprinted from Play It Safe, a Guide to Safety for Young Athletes, with permission of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.\nChildren who participate in athletic activity often experience some discomfort as their bones and muscles grow and they practice new movements. Some aches and pains can be expected, but a child's complaints always deserve careful attention. Some injuries, if left untreated, can cause permanent damage and interfere with proper physical growth.\nAlthough many growth plate injuries are caused by accidents that occur during play or athletic activity, growth plates are also susceptible to other types of injury, infection, and diseases that can alter their normal growth and development.\nAdditional reasons for growth plate injuries\nChild abuse can result in skeletal injuries. These more often occur in very young children, who still have years of bone growth ahead of them. One study reported that half of all fractures due to child abuse were found in children younger than age one, whereas only two percent of accidental fractures occurred in this age group.\n- Injury from cold or frostbite can also damage the growth plate in children and result in short, stubby fingers or premature degenerative arthritis.\n- Radiation, which is used to treat certain cancers in children, can damage the growth plate. Moreover, a recent study has suggested that chemotherapy given for childhood cancers may also negatively affect bone growth.\n- Children with certain neurological disorders that result in sensory deficit, muscular imbalance, or looseness in the ligaments are prone to growth plate fractures, especially at the ankle and knee. Similar types of injury are seen in children who are born with insensitivity to pain.\n- The growth plates are the site of many inherited disorders that affect the musculoskeletal system. Scientists are just beginning to understand the genes involved in skeletal formation, growth, and development. This new information is raising hopes for improving treatment of children who are born with poorly formed or improperly functioning growth plates.\nSigns that require a visit to the doctor*\n- Inability to play following an acute or sudden injury.\n- Decreased ability to play because of long-term complications following an injury.\n- Visible deformity of the child's arms or legs.\n- Severe pain from acute injuries that prevent the use of an arm or leg.\n* Reprinted from Play It Safe, a Guide to Safety for Young Athletes with permission of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.\nHow are growth plate fractures diagnosed?\nAfter learning how the injury occurred and examining the child, the doctor will probably use X rays to determine the type of fracture and decide on a treatment plan. Because growth plates have not yet hardened into solid bone, they don't show on X rays. Instead, they appear as gaps between the shaft of a long bone, called the metaphysis, and the end of the bone, called the epiphysis. Because injuries to the growth plate may be hard to see on X ray, an X ray of the noninjured side of the body may be taken so the two sides can be compared. In some cases, other diagnostic tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), or ultrasound, will be used.\nSince the 1960's, the Salter-Harris classification, which divides most growth plate fractures into five categories based on the type of damage, has been the standard. The categories are as follows:\n* Adapted from Disorders and Injuries of the Musculoskeletal System, 3rd Edition, Robert B. Salter, Baltimore, Williams and Wilkins, 1999. Used with the author's permission.\nThe epiphysis is completely separated from the end of the bone, or the metaphysis. The vital portions of the growth plate remain attached to the epiphysis. Only rarely will the doctor have to put the fracture back into place, but all type I injuries generally require a cast to keep the fracture in place as it heals. Unless there is damage to the blood supply, the likelihood that the bone will grow normally is excellent.\nThis is the most common type of growth plate fracture. The epiphysis, together with the growth plate, is partially separated from the metaphysis, which is cracked. Unlike type I fractures, type II fractures typically have to be put back into place and immobilized for normal growth to continue. Because these fractures usually return to their normal shape during growth, sometimes the doctor does not have to manipulate this fracture back into position.\nThis fracture occurs only rarely, usually at the lower end of the tibia, one of the long bones of the lower leg. It happens when a fracture runs completely through the epiphysis and separates part of the epiphysis and growth plate from the metaphysis. Surgery is sometimes necessary to restore the joint surface to normal. The outlook or prognosis for growth is good if the blood supply to the separated portion of the epiphysis is still intact, if the fracture is not displaced, and if a bridge of new bone has not formed at the site of the fracture.\nThis fracture runs through the epiphysis, across the growth plate, and into the metaphysis. Surgery is needed to restore the joint surface to normal and to perfectly align the growth plate. Unless perfect alignment is achieved and maintained during healing, prognosis for growth is poor. This injury occurs most commonly at the end of the humerus (the upper arm bone) near the elbow.\nThis uncommon injury occurs when the end of the bone is crushed and the growth plate is compressed. It is most likely to occur at the knee or ankle. Prognosis is poor, since premature stunting of growth is almost inevitable.\nA newer classification, called the Peterson classification, adds a type VI fracture, in which a portion of the epiphysis, growth plate, and metaphysis is missing. This usually occurs with an open wound or compound fracture, often involving lawnmowers, farm machinery, snowmobiles, or gunshot wounds. All type VI fractures require surgery, and most will require later reconstructive or corrective surgery. Bone growth is almost always stunted.\nWhat kind of doctor treats growth plate injuries?\nFor all but the simplest injuries, the doctor may recommend that the injury be treated by an orthopaedic surgeon, a doctor who specializes in bone and joint problems in children and adults. Some problems may require the services of a pediatric orthopaedic surgeon, who specializes in injuries and musculoskeletal disorders in children.\nHow are growth plate injuries treated?\nAs indicated in the previous section, treatment depends on the type of fracture. Treatment, which should be started as soon as possible after injury, generally involves a mix of the following:\nImmobilization: The affected limb is often put in a cast or splint, and the child is told to limit any activity that puts pressure on the injured area. The doctor may also suggest that ice be applied to the area.\nManipulation or Surgery: In about one out of 10 cases, the doctor will have to put the bones or joints back in their correct positions, either by using his or her hands (called manipulation) or by performing surgery. After the procedure, the bone will be set in place so it can heal without moving. This is usually done with a cast that encloses the injured growth plate and the joints on both sides of it. The cast is left in place until the injury heals, which can take anywhere from a few weeks to several months for serious injuries. The need for manipulation or surgery depends on the location and extent of the injury, its effect on nearby nerves and blood vessels, and the child's age.\nStrengthening and Range-of-Motion Exercises: These treatments may also be recommended after the fracture is healed.\nLong-Term Followup: Long-term follow-up is usually necessary to monitor the child's recuperation and growth. Evaluation may include X rays of matching limbs at three- to six-month intervals for at least two years. Some fractures require periodic evaluations until the child's bones have finished growing. Sometimes a growth arrest line may appear as a marker of the injury. Continued bone growth away from that line may mean that there will not be a long-term problem, and the doctor may decide to stop following the patient.\nWhat is the prognosis for a child with a growth plate injury?\nMost growth plate fractures heal without any lasting harm. Whether long-term damage occurs depends on the following factors, in descending order of importance:\n- Severity of the injury. If the injury causes the blood supply to the epiphysis to be cut off, growth can be stunted. If the growth plate is shifted, shattered, or crushed, a bony bridge is more likely to form and the risk of growth retardation is higher. An open injury in which the skin is broken carries the risk of infection, which could destroy the growth plate.\n- Age of the child. In a younger child, the bones have a great deal of growing to do; therefore, growth arrest can be more serious, and closer surveillance is needed.\n- Which growth plate is injured. Some growth plates are more responsible for extensive bone growth than others.\n- Type of growth plate fracture. The five fracture types are described in the section, How Are Growth Plate Fractures Diagnosed?\nThe treatment depends on the above factors and also bears on the prognosis.The most frequent complication of a growth plate fracture is premature arrest of bone growth. The affected bone grows less than it would have without the injury, and the resulting limb could be shorter than the opposite, uninjured limb. If only part of the growth plate is injured, growth may be lopsided and the limb may be crooked.\nGrowth plate injuries at the knee are at greatest risk of complications. Nerve and blood vessel damage occurs most frequently there. Injuries to the knee have a much higher incidence of premature growth arrest and crooked growth.\nWhat are researchers trying to learn about growth plate injuries?\nResearchers continue to develop methods to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of growth plate injuries and to improve patient outcomes. Examples of such work include\n- Removal of a growth-blocking \"bridge\" or bar of bone that can form across a growth plate following a fracture. After the bridge is removed, fat, cartilage, or other materials are inserted in its place to prevent the bridge from forming again.\n- Use of distraction osteogenesis, a procedure in which a bone that is prematurely shortened is surgically cut and gradually lengthened.\n- Development of methods to regenerate musculoskeletal tissue by using principles of tissue engineering.\nTo improve the early diagnosis of growth plate injuries, the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculosketetal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS) is supporting a study to evaluate the use of MRI to visualize young bones and enable prompt, appropriate treatment. In May 1997, the NIAMS, together with the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS), and the Orthopaedic Research and Education Foundation, supported a conference on skeletal growth and development. The resulting publication, Skeletal Growth and Development: Clinical Issues and Basic Science Advances, can be obtained from the AAOS at the address listed below.The NIAMS is working with the NICHD, the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases to support a research initiative in the area of skeletal growth and development. The purpose of the initiative is to stimulate research to identify and understand the action of the genes that regulate skeletal development;\n- Evaluate factors that affect growth plate function;\n- Develop animal models to study disturbances in skeletal growth and development; and\n- Find new ways to correct musculoskeletal deformities.\nWhere can people find more information about growth plate injuries?American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons\n6300 North River Road\nRosemont, IL 60018-4262\nFax on Demand: 800/999-2939\nThe academy provides education and practice management services for orthopaedic surgeons and allied health professionals.

{"question":"Are the governance structures of a coterminous town-village and the Village of Skaneateles similar?","answer":"No, they have different governance structures. A coterminous town-village can function either as a single local government with one governing body serving both units, or as two separate local governments with separate officers and boards. In contrast, Skaneateles operates as two distinct entities - a Village and a Town - with separate jurisdictions, where the Village (1.7 square miles) is surrounded by the larger Town (48.8 square miles) and they maintain separate governance while working together on initiatives like their joint Comprehensive Plan.","context":["Legal Memorandum LG06\nWHAT IS A COTERMINOUS TOWN-VILLAGE?\nA coterminous town-village is a unique form of local government organization. Geographically, the town and village share the same boundaries. Depending on how the coterminous unit is formed, the town and the village function together as a single local government or as two separate local governments. As a single unit of government, the governing body of one unit of the coterminous government serves as the governing body of the other unit. This process results in one of the forms of government being the primary form of government -either town of village- effectively eliminating the other as far as administration is concerned. Where the coterminous entity functions as two local governments, separate officers and boards are chosen or selected and both town and village entities possess governance authority.\nCurrently, there are five coterminous town-villages in New York: Mount Kisco, Harrison and Scarsdale, in Westchester County, Green Island in Albany County, and East Rochester in Monroe County.\nA coterminous town-village can be created in several ways. One way is for a new village to be incorporated in a town which has no existing villages, with the new village having the same boundaries as the existing town. This method would comply with the prerequisites for forming a new village under Village Law, §2-200. The coterminous Town-Villages of Harrison and Scarsdale were created in this way.\nAnother method is for an existing village to use the procedures of General Municipal Law, Article 17, to annex all of the adjacent territory in its town lying outside the village. Essentially, the village would expand its boundaries to become coterminous with the town. For this to occur, there would have to be no other villages already in existence in the town. Additionally, the procedure requires approval of both the existing village and town governing boards, plus the approval of the voters at a referendum held in the outlying territory which is to be annexed.\nA third method is for the State Legislature to adopt a special act creating the coterminous town-village. Since it would be for the benefit of only two municipalities, such a special act would require that the two existing governments send a \"home rule request\" to the Legislature to enact the bill. In the special act, the boundaries of the new municipality would be set forth, and other provisions would be written regarding governmental administration, disposition of real property and other assets and obligations of the existing municipalities. Although a referendum is not required by any existing general statute, the Legislature may condition the creation of the town-village on the approval of the voters at a referendum. By utilizing the method of a special act, the boundaries of the new town-village could follow an existing town or village boundary, or they could follow newly-drawn boundaries. Both the Village and the Town of Green Island were created by separate acts of the State Legislature in the 19th Century.\nA fourth method is for a public petition to be submitted under Article Five of the Town Law, calling for the division of the existing town into two towns, one of which would have the same boundaries as an existing village. The coterminous Town-Villages of Mount Kisco and East Rochester were created in this way, although in each of those cases two existing towns were divided to create the new town. The formation of Mount Kisco was also later ratified by an act of the State Legislature.\nAn Article Five petition may be signed by any registered voter of the town, whether a resident of the village or not. The petition must contain signatures totaling at least five per cent of the total number of votes cast in the town for the office of Governor at the last gubernatorial election--but not less than 100 in a first-class town or not less than 25 in a second-class town. The petition must be submitted to the county legislative body, which must hold a public hearing and then make a determination whether to grant the petition. The petition may only be granted by a two-thirds vote of the county legislative body. If granted, there will then be a referendum on the division of the town. All registered town voters, including residents of the village, will be eligible to vote on the proposition to divide the town.\nRegardless as to how a coterminous town-village is created, there is permanent State legislation governing administration in the municipality once it has been created. Article 17 of the Village Law contains detailed provisions concerning such issues as alteration of boundaries, election of officers, their powers and duties, bonds and other indebtedness, assessments, and the administration of improvement districts. For example, Article 17 requires that, in a new town created with the same boundaries as an existing village, a referendum must be held to determine whether the voters wish the local government to operate \"principally as a village\" or \"principally as a town.\" After the election, there will thereafter be a single governing body, with the members holding office as both the town and the village board, but functioning primarily as either the one or the other.\nIf a new village is incorporated to embrace the entire territory of an already-existing town, the town board may submit a proposition to the voters as to whether they wish the board of trustees to function also as the town board. (If at least 50 taxpayers petition for such an election, then the town board has no choice: it is required to submit the proposition to the voters.) If the voters turn down the proposition, then there will continue to be separate village and town boards, although the municipalities are coterminous.\nArticle 17 also provides that the creation of a coterminous town-village shall not affect the existence or boundaries of any school district or change the levy or collection of taxes for any school district. Similarly, the jurisdiction of existing town and village courts must be extended to cover any judicial actions pending at the time of creation of the new municipality.\nEven though the new coterminous municipality may function primarily either as a town or as a village, it will be required to continue to perform at least some of the functions of both. The change of municipal status to that of a coterminous town-village will have a fiscal impact that cannot be determined until a thorough study has been conducted. While additional local assistance may be forthcoming, there will be additional expenditure responsibilities as well.","Dealing with rural sprawl in an upstate New York community\nA team of urban design graduate students from Notre Dame created a plan for Skaneateles, New York, the classic lakefront town in the Finger Lakes.\nLocated on the edge of what is called the Syracuse metropolitan area, Skaneateles (pronounced SKAN-ee-AT-lus) is a Village surrounded mostly by countryside. Thanks to a charming main street that skirts the northern end of Skaneateles Lake, the Village is one of the more scenic Upstate communities.\nPolitically, Skaneateles is a Village of 1.7 square miles surrounded by a 48.8 square mile Town of the same name. In New York State, a Town is a rural or suburban area, while small urban places are called villages. The combined population of the Village and Town is about 10,000. The Town and Village are updating their joint Comprehensive Plan with the help of the Notre Dame team, which conducted a public charrette in September.\nLike thousands of towns across the US, Skaneateles's urban fabric has been eroding bits at a time with “rural sprawl.” The charrette's challenge was to find a way to repair existing sprawl and channel future growth into infill and more compact hamlets.\nDuring the charrette, the Notre Dame students produced a Transect map of the Village and Town (Image 1) and a series of figure-ground drawings (Images 2-4) that dramatically illustrate the problem.\nThe colors of Image 1 represent the Transect from T- 1 (light green natural areas) through T-5 (the dark purple village main street). Civic sites are shown in red, urban parks are dark green, and special uses — e.g. industrial areas — are dark gray. The lake is blue.\nSprawl doesn’t fit any of these categories of the traditional Transect, and therefore it shows up as white splotches. The image dramatically illustrates that even around a small town, sprawl has spread extensively. Even including the T-3 part of the Transect (low-density sub-urban development that is still walkable), there appears to be more sprawl than urban fabric in and around Skaneateles. That's not unusual.\nImages 2-4 illustrate how zoning is contributing to rural sprawl. Image 2 depicts an idealized farm landscape in a part of the Town of Skaneateles. Image 3 shows the reality of existing sprawl development in that location. Image 4 illustrates what the area would look like if the current low-density zoning is built out.\nRetrofitting an auto-oriented street\nSprawl is mostly confined to the Town — but not entirely. Fennell Street in the Village is lined with auto-oriented uses and street-fronting parking lots. The development serves a purpose — Fennell Street has a supermarket and drug and hardware stores that are vital to residents. A goal of the plan is to allow this thoroughfare to redevelop in a more pedestrian-friendly manner while maintaining the retail that is vital to residents.\nImages 5 and 6 consist of a plan and rendering of Fennell Street as it is now. Images 7, 8, and 9 are a proposed plan, rendering, and street section for Fennell. The plan calls for new buildings placed much closer to the street to provide a consistent street edge that defines the street spatially. Liner buildings hide the large grocery store parking lot. A new square is envisioned to be fronted by a post office, a new civic building (a village office), and bank.\nThe curb-to-curb dimensions of the street don’t change, but the sidewalks and zero-lot-line storefronts will make it more appealing to pedestrians, says Philip Bess, Director of Graduate Studies at the Notre Dame School of Architecture. “The 12-foot travel lane is a little wide, but appropriate to the type of traffic on Fennell,” he explains.\nThe students also carefully considered how to improve “gateway” areas where travelers enter the Village on Route 20, an east-west state highway, which serves as the main street inside the Village. Flanking the Village on both sides are strings of typical strip commercial buildings that have developed over the course of 50 or 60 years.\nOne of my favorite parts of the plan is the proposal to convert sections of Route 20 on both sides of the Village from a highway into a boulevard (Image 10). The strip commercial businesses are reconfigured from scattered sprawl to urban blocks that accommodate pedestrians, automobiles, and a mixture of uses (Image 11).\nSuch targeted highway retrofits are the kind of projects that state and federal transportation departments should be funding to promote smart growth and reduce vehicle miles traveled. Both the federal government (see link) and New York State appear to be getting on board with this approach (see link).\nThe students suggest modest changes to typical Route 20 buildings — such as pitched roofs and parking in the rear — that could make a big difference in how they relate to the proposed boulevard. Since this area is not connected to the Village sewer system, the students propose that small wetlands serve as a natural biofilter. “This would still be an area for inexpensive, informal buildings — some auto-oriented,” says Bess.\nOne more aspect of the plan that I highlight here is the hamlets. Not all new development is likely to take place on infill sites, so the students looked at how to accommodate growth disconnected from the Village. The team focused on the creation of a few hamlets, mostly in areas close to current employment opportunities. Image 12 shows the plan for one such hamlet — Skaneateles Falls.\nThe work shown here is preliminary, and the students will modify their ideas over the course of the semester and in response to public comments. Some of the work is likely to be included in the new Comprehensive Plan. The charrette cost Skaneateles $10,000, I was told, \"a little less than Notre Dame's expenses,\" says Bess, \"but times are tight and the Town and Village are on a budget too.\" That's a very good deal for the quality of work that was produced, in my view.\nMany of the ideas from the Skaneateles charrette are applicable to other villages that are dealing with similar problems of rural sprawl."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:10fb65bb-96c1-4144-9a0d-87af04365acf>","<urn:uuid:a1d6bebb-aafe-4ece-9f0b-f6a7c5100892>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Do San Antonio's 311SA and Toronto's winter maintenance programs differ in their approach to community engagement?","answer":"Yes, they differ significantly. San Antonio's 311SA focuses on digital community engagement, allowing residents to build social media followings, track neighbors' issues, and propose new problem categories through a mobile interface. In contrast, Toronto's winter maintenance program takes a more operational approach, with 24-hour patrols checking road conditions and staff monitoring weather forecasts, focusing on practical service delivery rather than community interaction.","context":["Emily Royall, Smart City Coordinator for the City of the San Antonio, spoke with Managing Editor Laura Benold about the city’s Smart 50 Award-winning project, 311SA, and what it means to be “smart”.\nLB: Let’s start off with the basics. Can you tell me about the 311SA project itself?\nER: 311SA transforms how the public connects with each other and the City of San Antonio on municipal services in our community. The platform shapes a new generation of discussion and action to resolve daily challenges related to the maintenance and care of our urban fabric.\n311SA is a radical departure from other 311 applications because it not only allows residents to flag and document issues, it also builds community around the resolution of those issues by allowing residents to propose new categories of problems, build a following through the social media environment, and track the issues their friends, neighbors and other residents share on a people-centric mobile interface. The application was built by a local technology company, CityFlag, and procured with the support of the city’s 311 department and the office of innovation.\nLB: How is the city kept accountable for request submitted through the app, and what prevents residents from being digitally neglected or ignored?\nER: The mobile app requests are not treated any differently than those that are processed when residents call the 311 customer service office. The mobile app is fully integrated with the city’s customer relationship management (CRM) system which serves as the intake system for services requests. The mobile app requests get submitted through the CRM system which then sends the request to the department to get addressed. The mobile app requests are not treated differently than requests coming in from the 311 call center or through the city’s website.\nLB: What themes have you noticed from engaged users? Are they demographically similar or different? Do they share common concerns?\nER: Since launch in August 2018, the focus has been mostly focused on responding to the issues identified by residents. Although we don’t collect personal information of users, we will be releasing aggregated 311 data to our entrepreneurial community to develop further insight and analysis through our CivTechSA initiative.\nLB: You have a resolution rate of 93%. What falls in the remaining 7%?\nER: The remaining 7% are issues that are still open and under investigation. The remaining items aren’t necessarily different from the 93%. Because the app is integrated with our CRM system, the cases remain open until they are closed. The status of the app is real time.\nLB: Was it simply the size of San Antonio at 1.5 million residents that prompted you to create this service, or was there something else that brought about your interest in reaching the community in this way?\nER: It’s true that San Antonio is a large, ever growing city. However, the spirit of this service is that we find innovative ways to connect to our public. 311SA is fun to use, it’s engaging, and it builds bridges between citizens and government.\nLB: What do you think San Antonio is currently known for? What do you want the city to be known for?\nER: “Puro” San Antonio is known for its rich history and cultural diversity. We are a city built by the confluence of many people along an ancient water source, the dynamics of which continue to play out in how our city grows physically and culturally.\nWe want our city to be known for celebrating that diversity and complexity by protecting, nurturing, and maintaining our urban landscape and the quality of life for our residents. We want to be known for pioneering a “community-first” smart city strategy, always keeping in focus how people actually live in our city.\nLB: How did you engage the community to the extent that they would adopt and use 311SA? What work are you still doing to educate the public?\nER: Our partner CityFlag helped get the word out about the application. At the official launch of 311SA, staff was on hand to train residents with how to use the application. The application is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly, which may have contributed to its wide popularity.\nLB: What does it mean to you to win a Smart 50 Award?\nER: It’s a huge honor for our smart cities team, our office, our partners CityFlag, and the 311 department at the City of San Antonio. For us, it means that we are on the right track with our smart city strategy that focuses on how to work collaboratively with our local entrepreneurship ecosystem to innovate smart city technologies that actually meet the needs of our residents. We’re so excited to continue developing our strategy in this space.\nLB: What’s next for the Department of Innovation in San Antonio?\nER: In 2019, with our SmartSA Partners (a consortium of local utilities and universities) we will launch our first round of RFPs in our three innovation zones — designated areas for prototyping smart city technologies. We will continue to evaluate the success of those prototypes hand-in-hand with our citizens, which will continue to rely on for feedback, ideas, and direction.\nWe will also be embarking on our third year of the CivTechSA program, that focuses on developing local technology talent by connecting entrepreneurs and students with city projects and challenges, in 2020. We will also be kickstarting the research and development arm of our office, that will support both internal and external process improvements. Finally, through our Metrolab partnership with local University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA), we will focus on bringing to bear new research and solutions that bridge our city’s digital divide, among several other projects.","Below is the uncorrected machine-read text of this chapter, intended to provide our own search engines and external engines with highly rich, chapter-representative searchable text of each book.

Intercity Transit, Walla Wallaâice and snow removal policy can be found in their website at: http:// www.wallawallawa.gov/depts/publicworks/streets/snow-icecontrol It states: The Street Division diligently follows weather reports, monitors our weather stations and road conditions, and prepares for and is on the ready for weather events. Often City crews get started in the early hours to eliminate commuting hazards or mitigate very snowy or icy conditions. In the event of snowfall where plow- ing is required, the City has five dump trucks with plows, two of which are equipped with sand spreaders. The City also utilizes a road grader for plowing. The City Street crew generally begins plowing when â¢ Snow reaches about four inches deep and the forecast is for continued snowfall. â¢ Moisture content of snow is a factor. âDry,â light snow is less of an issue than âwet,â heavy snow. â¢ The crew plows priority routes first to keep arterials and emergency service routes open. â¢ Once the priority routes are cleared of snow the crews begin plowing residential streets. View Snow Removal Priority Map A few pointers for homeowners when snow falls: â¢ Give plenty of room to snow plows and sandersâthese vehicles make frequent stops, turns, and back-ups. â¢ Park cars off the street where possible to avoid being plowed in. This also allows the plow to place the snow next to the curb. â¢ Keep the sidewalks in front of your home free from snow and ice. â¢ Keep a clear path to your mail box. â¢ Help your neighbor with snow removal from their driveway and sidewalk. â¢ Some local organizations have volunteers who are willing to assist the elderly or handicapped with snow removal. Please call the Street Division at XXX-XXX-XXXX if you would like to be added to the volunteer list. A document listing individuals and agencies that can assist property owners who are unable to remove the snow from their property is available here. 2. Lane TransitâSnow Removal Plan at LTD Stations The purpose of snow removal at LTD facilities is to protect District employees and customers from unsafe conditions due to ice and snow and to ensure free vehicle movement on LTD property. The primary focus for snow removal at all facilities will be walkways to ensure that employees and customers can safely navigate the lots, boarding platforms, and walkways. At locations with large plat- form areas, such as the Eugene Station and Springfield Station, the concentration of volunteers for snow removal will ensure that customers can get to and from the buses and from bay to bay. The Glenwood snow removal will concentrate on sidewalks around the building and ensure that there are cleared walkways to the bus lot and the employee parking lot. Listed below are the staff who have volunteered to help with snow removal at the various stations and at the Customer Service Center with phone coverage. There are additional people we can call upon if neces- sary to cover Glenwood and the other stations, or it may mean that a crew at the smaller stations will do double duty. We will have to play it by ear. If helpers will be out of town, they need to inform XXXX in advance. APPENDIX C Ice and Snow Removal PoliciesâSamples\n66 The (*) symbol by a station indicates that supplies are in a storage area. Shovels, deicer, cones, safety vests, and applicators for the deicer will be stored on the premises at those locations. Volunteers will be issued a key to all of the storage areas. For those assigned to stations without storage, Facilities Main- tenance staff will give each team member a shovel and other supplies mentioned in the previous section. XXXX will make the determination that snow removal is necessary and will call XXXX, who will call each person on the snow removal list. XXXX will contact the Customer Service volunteers as needed. XXXX names and phone numbers EmX StationsâEmX Stations will be maintained by Facilities staff and privately contracted shelter cleaners. Eugene Station*âXXXX Lane Community College LCCâwill provide its own snow/ice removal. UO Station North & South UOâwill provide its own snow/ice removal. Valley River Center VRCâwill provide its own snow/ice removal. VOLUNTEERS FOR CUSTOMER SERVICE CENTER PHONE COVERAGE: XXXX Snow and Ice Procedures for the Use of the Following Equipment: Rock spreader Snow blower I Snow blower II Snow plow Note: Employees must be trained on the use of the equipment before they use it. The graveyard super- visor will plow the bus yard as needed before the call goes out for snow volunteers. This will allow the buses to move around the yard and travel out of the gate. Plowing the bus lot is relatively easy; simply push the snow out of the way. (You can move the snow over to the curb on the south side of the lot.) 3. Los Alamos CountyâSnow and Ice Control Plan Transit Division The normal snow and ice control operations will provide for the snow removal services along existing public transit routes (roadways and sidewalks) in accordance with the Planâs priority schedule (page 20). These services will include the use of snow plows, sanding, salt, and deicers, as well as other heavy equip- ment as needed. Transit employees will be activated as needed to perform the hand clearing of snow and ice from the bus shelters, access directly to the shelters from the longitudinal sidewalks, and areas around bus stops as time allows. 4. Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) The 2015â2016 Snow & Ice Operations Plan can be found at: http://www.mbta.com/winter/bus_status/ The website states: Winter WeatherâBus Stop Clearing and Snow Removal As snow begins to fall, riders can depend on the MBTA to be ready. The MBTA is determined and pre- pared to provide its riders with clear and accessible bus stops during the winter months. Added resources and equipment help the MBTA work through harsh weather conditions and riders will experience snow removal improvements as they commute through the Commonwealth. The MBTA will prioritize the clear- ing of snow and ice from bus stops along its Fifteen Key Bus Routes. What the MBTA Clears The MBTA will clear snow from all MBTA-owned bus shelters and stops along the following key routes: 1, 15, 22, 23, 28, 32, 39, 57, 66, 71, 73, 77, 111, 116, 117. For a full list of MBTA-owned bus shelters cleared by the MBTA, please click here.\n67 Other Stops Virtually all other bus stops are the property owner/abutterâs responsibility. The municipality in which the bus stop is located may have the ability to enforce snow removal, depending on the local ordinance. If you notice one of these stops is obstructed by snow/ice, refer to this municipality contact list to find the contact information for the department that may be able to help resolve the problem. When will bus stops be cleared? The MBTAâs goal is to clear all MBTA-owned bus shelters and stops along its key routes listed above within twenty-four hours of the end of a snowstorm. All MBTA-owned bus shelters and stops will be cleared as quickly as possible. How do I know if my stop has been cleared? Following winter storms, the MBTA will post updates on bus stop clearing status of bus stops along the Fifteen Key Bus Routes within the table below. Who to Contact To report a bus stop that has not been cleared, please call the MBTAâs Customer Care Department at 617.222.3200/(TTY) 617.222.5146 with the route and intersection for the stop that needs to be cleared. You can also e-mail this information to email@example.com. 5. MTA New York City Transit City Dept. of Sanitation is responsible for clearing bus routes and the interior of bus shelters. City Dept. of Transportation is responsible for clearing around the shelter and in some cases creating a path to the bus stop/shelter. Depending on the location, City Dept. of Parks or even private companies may be responsible as well. MTA will in some cases help clear bus stops/shelter, even though we do not have responsibility for clearing shelters. 6. City of Toronto The City of Torontoâs Winter Operations Program keeps roads and sidewalks safe and passable for pedes- trians, cyclists, and motorists. 24-hour patrols continuously check road conditions and staff monitor weather forecasts and pavement temperature. Even before the snow starts to fall, our crews swing into action and they work continuously until the storm is over. Levels of Service for Winter Maintenance Activities. The maintenance of a safe and reliable municipal transportation system is based on three main elements: de-icing, snow ploughing, and snow removal. The selection of the most appropriate method of dealing with a particular winter storm is principally based on the amount of accumulated snowfall and prevailing temperatures. Based on these, the selected method offers a balance between the clearing and/or removal of the accumulated snow and ice at an appropriately determined pace in a fiscally responsible manner. In addition to these major winter service operations, work crews ensure that catch-basins, drains, and culverts work properly and that crosswalks, bus stops, and sidewalks for senior citizens and people with physical disabilities are also cleared of snow and ice. The effective deployment of these winter service operations makes it possible for emergency vehicles and the public to travel safely, for the transit system to provide the public with timely service and for commerce to continue functioning. http://www1.toronto.ca/ wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=e33422cdac873410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD&vgnext channel=cd3d4074781e1410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD 7. One of the transit agencies has a policy in writing that they do NOT clear bus stops during storms because of liability issues resulting from falls.\nAbbreviations and acronyms used without definitions in TRB publications: A4A Airlines for America AAAE American Association of Airport Executives AASHO American Association of State Highway Officials AASHTO American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials ACIâNA Airports Council InternationalâNorth America ACRP Airport Cooperative Research Program ADA Americans with Disabilities Act APTA American Public Transportation Association ASCE American Society of Civil Engineers ASME American Society of Mechanical Engineers ASTM American Society for Testing and Materials ATA American Trucking Associations CTAA Community Transportation Association of America CTBSSP Commercial Truck and Bus Safety Synthesis Program DHS Department of Homeland Security DOE Department of Energy EPA Environmental Protection Agency FAA Federal Aviation Administration FAST Fixing Americaâs Surface Transportation Act (2015) FHWA Federal Highway Administration FMCSA Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration FRA Federal Railroad Administration FTA Federal Transit Administration HMCRP Hazardous Materials Cooperative Research Program IEEE Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers ISTEA Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 ITE Institute of Transportation Engineers MAP-21 Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act (2012) NASA National Aeronautics and Space Administration NASAO National Association of State Aviation Officials NCFRP National Cooperative Freight Research Program NCHRP National Cooperative Highway Research Program NHTSA National Highway Traffic Safety Administration NTSB National Transportation Safety Board PHMSA Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration RITA Research and Innovative Technology Administration SAE Society of Automotive Engineers SAFETEA-LU Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users (2005) TCRP Transit Cooperative Research Program TDC Transit Development Corporation TEA-21 Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century (1998) TRB Transportation Research Board TSA Transportation Security Administration U.S.DOT United States Department of Transportation\nNO N-PRO FIT O RG .

{"question":"I'm planning to set up a marine aquarium with biological filtration. What are the key factors for maintaining healthy bacteria in a bio filter, and what are the different filtration system options available for marine tanks?","answer":"For healthy bacteria in a bio filter, several vital factors are essential: temperature between 10-45°C (optimal 20-40°C), pH between 4.0-9.5 (optimal 6.5-7.5), sufficient dissolved oxygen, building materials containing elements like phosphorus and nitrogen, and absence of toxic substances. The bacteria reproduce rapidly, with doubling times ranging from 20 minutes to 30 hours. For marine tanks, there are three main filtration approaches: 'high-tech' systems using advanced equipment like redox controllers, 'natural' systems relying on protein skimmers and live rock, and 'traditional' systems using undergravel filters. While undergravel filters are cheaper and nearly foolproof, wet/dry filters are superior as they trap detritus more effectively and are easier to maintain without disrupting the tank. The wet/dry filter consists of a sump and biological chamber where water trickles through plastic pieces colonized by beneficial bacteria.","context":["Biological Filtration: What Exactly Does That Imply?\nThe aim of biological purification is to keep the water, in which our\nsplendid fish and plants live, at a certain quality in which they feel\nthenselves pleasantly comfortable.

I shall take the liberty of assuming that you have some knowledge of aquariums, although you may never have kept one before.\nTo successfully maintain marine organisms in the home for any reasonable length of time, you will need an aquarium of some kind. This should be a rectangular tank of any size larger than, say, 10 gallons (38 liters), although the bigger the better. It will need a sturdy support near electricity, and a source of water should be convenient.\nThe tank should be made entirely of glass or acrylic. You will need a cover for the tank, and a heater of sufficient wattage to keep the aquarium at a constant 75 degrees Fahrenheit (24 degrees Celsius). About 3 watts per gallon is usually satisfactory.\nYou will need an assortment of accessories for maintenance chores: a couple of 5-gallon (20-liter) buckets, a larger plastic container of about 30 gallons (115 liters), some flexible hose, nets...in short, the same sort of stuff you need for a freshwater tank. You will also need both a filtration system and a lighting system, the selection of which you should give considerable thought to.\nWhen you think about equipment for a new marine aquarium, think about nutrients. That's right, nutrients — of which there are not very many in the waters around coral reefs. The novice saltwater enthusiast should always remember that the life forms destined to inhabit his or her marine aquarium come from the waters around coral reefs. For reasons explained below, most of what you will be doing when caring for your marine aquarium will be involved with removing nutrients from the water in the tank.\nSo let's think about nutrients for a moment. Nutrients are, of course, essential for the survival of most living organisms. However, one of the special features of the coral reef environment is the paucity of nutrients in the water. Reef organisms have developed marvelously efficient ways of capturing and, in many cases, recycling most of the available nutrients. The result is that the bulk of the nitrogen, phosphorus and organic carbon present in the reef habitat is found in the biomass, not dissolved in the water.\nIn the aquarium, which is a closed system and an ecologically incomplete environment even under the best of circumstances, excess nutrients begin to accumulate from the moment living organisms are added. This accumulation results in a decline in the water quality of the system. If nothing is done to reverse this process, water conditions will soon deteriorate to a point outside the range of tolerance of the life forms. They, in turn, will fare poorly.\nFiltration is therefore necessary to prevent, or at least retard, this gradual worsening of water conditions. Filtration, properly chosen and combined with water changes and the judicious application of tank additives, enables the aquarist to maintain aquarium water in good condition almost indefinitely.\nSunlight plays an important role in the nutrient recycling process that occurs naturally on coral reefs. This fact has important implications in the selection of aquarium lighting.\nChoosing suitable filtration and lighting is only one aspect of setting up a successful saltwater aquarium, but it is a very important aspect, for two reasons. First, a significant portion of the total cost of the aquarium will be spent for the filtration and lighting systems. Second, there is a trade-off between the initial investment in equipment and the amount of effort you will expend later in keeping the tank in the appropriate condition. Such effort may not only involve maintenance chores but, alas, may also be associated with medicating sick fish, replacing filter media and light bulbs, coping with prolific algae growth and repairing worn or faulty equipment. The time to be choosy and critical is now, when you are first setting up the tank, not six months from now when that bargain-priced pump fails while you are away for the weekend.\nThere is such a bewildering array of options available for filtering a marine tank. Which one is best? The correct answer, of course, is that no one filtration system is suitable for all applications, and that the choice for your particular aquarium should be determined by what you intend to keep in the tank. There are probably as many filtration theories as there are aquarists, but for simplicity's sake, I will discuss only three approaches to marine tank filtration. I shall refer to these as \"high-tech,\" \"natural\" and \"traditional\" setups.\nThoroughly dedicated marine hobbyists, by the way, can actually forgo filtration altogether, provided they are willing to carry out frequent, large water changes. The ultimate purpose of any filtration system is to extend the useful life of the water in the tank. And no filtration system, no matter how sophisticated, can eliminate the need for partial water changes. All filtration methods are applied with the intent of preventing changes in the chemistry of the aquarium water that would render it unsuitable (i.e., stress-producing) for the inhabitants of the tank.\nHigh-tech filtration systems seek to automate, insofar as possible, maintenance of the appropriate water quality. The goal is stability of the water chemistry with minimal labor for the aquarist. The redox controller (to be discussed later in this series) receives my vote for the centerpiece of such a system, although only a couple of years ago any tank fitted with a wet-dry filter was high-tech. If you are comfortable with or like to use computers, fax machines and so on, you may be a candidate for a high-tech aquarium system. To do it right, you will need a roomy budget.\nNatural filtration systems rely primarily on the good judgement of the aquarist, a protein skimmer and an ample quantity of live rock. This is my personal choice, but not one I can, in good conscience, recommend to the novice. Developing good judgement about marine aquarium husbandry requires some hands-on experience. For the beginner, it is wiser to employ some equipment that will provide a margin for errors in judgement.\nTraditional systems are, in my view, defined by the use of the undergravel filter. This somewhat less-than-satisfactory device has the decided advantage of being both cheap and almost foolproof. Its primary disadvantage is that proper cleaning is difficult to accomplish.\nIn the last few years, wet/dry filtration systems have received much attention, largely with regard to their application in maintaining so-called reef tanks. Any marine aquarium, however, whether reef or fish-only, will fare better and be easier to maintain if a wet-dry filter is installed instead of using an undergravel filter. Because traditionalists will be horrified at this allegation, and the novice aquarist may be horrified at the cost of a wet/dry filter, let me explain why I believe there is a decided advantage to this method of filtration over the more commonplace, and certainly cheaper, undergravel filter.\nAt minimum, we require a filter to process toxic ammonia into less toxic nitrate via the process known as biological filtration. If you do not clearly understand what is meant by biological filtration as it applies to aquarium maintenance, stop right here and do some reading on the subject. Complete descriptions of this process, which is achieved by beneficial bacteria, are found in virtually any decent book on aquariums, whether freshwater or saltwater. Excellent articles that deal with biological filtration in detail regularly appear in this and other magazines.\nIn a nutshell, your saltwater aquarium filtration system must be able to detoxify the ammonia (a form of nitrogen — a nutrient) that will be produced by the inhabitants of the tank, or they will die rather promptly. Both undergravel filters and wet/dry filters easily accomplish biological filtration.\nWet/dry filters, however, excel in two ways. They trap detritus in such a manner that it can be removed with much less effort than is required for an undergravel filter, and they are far easier to maintain, with little physical disruption of the tank.\nA wet/dry filter is essentially a watertight box (sump) with a smaller box (biological chamber) sitting on top. Water flows from the aquarium by gravity, trickles through the biological chamber, collects in the sump and is pumped back into the aquarium. The biological chamber is filled with pieces of plastic that become colonized by the beneficial bacteria that detoxify ammonia. The sump often houses additional filter media, or other equipment, and thus serves as a convenient place to hide this extra hardware underneath the tank, out of sight.\nThe trickling of water through the biological chamber permits maximum contact with the air, allowing essential oxygen to be dissolved in the water and harmful carbon dioxide to escape. Detritus, which consists mostly of dead bacteria, is trapped in a simple sheet of polyester fiber pad placed at the top of the biological chamber through which water from the tank must flow. Good filters have a nifty drawer in this position in order to facilitate periodic cleaning of this pad. Additional detritus accumulates in the sump, beneath the biological chamber, from which it may be siphoned with minimal disturbance to the tank itself. Maintenance chores are therefore more easily accomplished and, consequently, more regularly performed.\nWith an undergravel filter, in contrast, all of this stuff — filter media (substrate), powerheads, airstones, wires, hoses and so on — is in the tank. This not only spoils the appearance of the tank, but makes proper cleaning almost impossible without severe imposition upon the peace of mind of the tank's inhabitants.\nI have mentioned detritus several times. Why is detritus such a problem? It acts as a storage depot for nutrients, and, as I mentioned above, most of what you want a filter to do is eliminate excess nutrients from the aquarium. Phosphorus compounds, of which detritus is a rich storehouse, will promote thick, obscuring growths of algae if allowed to accumulate. Organic carbon compounds, dissolved in the water but also found abundantly in detritus, will provide food for undesirable and possibly disease-producing bacteria. The water in the tank will be analogous in purity to the air over the Los Angeles freeways and your fish will not thrive.\nIf you cannot justify the purchase of a wet/dry filter and must settle for an undergravel system, bear in mind the limitations of the latter. Resolve to spend more time maintaining the tank and resist the temptation to stock a large number of fish. I will present some important facts about choosing a wet/dry filter system in the next installment of this article.\nLighting plays a key role in the marine aquarium, but is a critical consideration only if you plan to keep invertebrates, such as anemones or corals. An aquarium that will not be home to such organisms should nevertheless be brightly illuminated. Reef fish are accustomed to high light levels in their natural habitat, and bright light will promote the growth of beneficial green algae. As you will come to understand, algae can be both a bane and a blessing in a marine aquarium.\nIf you plan on keeping anemones, which require bright light, you should consider fixtures that permit you to place several fluorescent lamps over the tank, or perhaps a metal halide system. I will discuss both types of lighting in a subsequent installment of this series.\nMost beginners opt for a tank containing fish and perhaps a few invertebrates, such as starfish or shrimps, that have no special light requirements. For these organisms, the standard fluorescent strip light that comes with most aquarium tanks is satisfactory. Such fixtures will accommodate a single fluorescent tube. Select a hood for the tank that will accommodate a tube of the maximum length that will fit across the top of the tank. The longer the tube, the brighter it will be.\nThe particular type of fluorescent tube is important, since all tubes are not created equal in terms of their light output or the aesthetic appeal of the color of the illumination. Some of the best are the Ultralume 5000K and Advantage X lamps manufactured by the Philips corporation. Some of the worst are cool white (the lamp usually supplied in hardware store fluorescent fixtures) and the various brands of lamps typified by the Sylvania Gro-Lux, which are designed for growing and displaying terrestrial plants. Gro-Lux type lamps are marketed widely under a variety of names for aquarium lighting. In my view, they are less than satisfactory."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:de701421-4950-4069-8d40-40684429f996>","<urn:uuid:a38ecf75-da2f-46c9-a07b-638cfea20658>"],"error":null}
{"question":"In studying Earth's geological processes, how does sea-floor spreading work at mid-ocean ridges, and what role does rock deformation play in this process?","answer":"At mid-ocean ridges, sea-floor spreading occurs when magma pushes upward through cracks due to diverging plates. This magma becomes igneous rock, forming new oceanic crust. The process was discovered through mapping the sea floor, where scientists found that rocks nearest to mid-ocean ridges are younger than those farther away. This spreading process involves rock deformation through tension stress, which stretches and pulls rock bodies apart at divergent boundaries. The deformation occurs due to isostasy - the balance between gravity and buoyancy on Earth's lithosphere as it floats on the asthenosphere. As new crust forms, the older crust becomes denser, eventually leading to subduction at trenches.","context":["2Geology: the study of planet Earth. James Hutton began studying geology in the late 1700’s.He realized that Earth’s surfaced changed gradually over time.The Principle of Uniformitarianism was developed from his observations.

With that scientists made the Theory of Plate Tectonics : Earth’s Plates are constantly moving\n24ConvectionPlate motions are due to the process of convection in the mantle.\n25Plate BoundariesMeasured using GPS at about 0.1 to 10 cm per year.\n26Plate BoundariesDivergent: Mid-Ocean ridge forms a divergent boundary.In Africa on land where plates move apart.\n27Plate Boundaries Convergent: Plates that come together or collide. Most common is where a oceanic plate subducts beneath a trench.\n28Plate BoundariesTransform: plates slide past each other, moving in opposite directions.\n29Mountain BuildingMost mountains form along plate boundaries.1. Two plates of continental crust collide along a convergent boundary.Indo-Australian & Eurasian Plate formed Himalayas.\n30Mountain Building2.

In Iceland the mid-ocean ridge the mountains rise about sea level.","Chapter 11, Section 1 - How Rock Deforms\nDeformation - The bending, tilting and breaking of Earth's crust. The change in the shape of rock in response to stress.\nIsostasy - The balance between gravity and buoyancy on the Earth's lithosphere, as it floats on the asthenosphere.\n- Changes in the lithosphere's weight can cause it to rise or sink.\n- This causes the crust to bend, and rock to deform.\n- As mountains are eroded, the area may rise => uplift.\n- As sediments are deposited at the mouth of a river, the area may sink => subsidence. (Gulf of Mexico at mouth of Mississippi River)\n- As glaciers grow, the land they are on sinks. Sea level drops, so the ocean floor rises.\n- As glacier melt, the lay rises. Sea level rises, so the ocean floor sinks.\nStress - The amount of force per unit area that acts on a rock.\n- Compression - Stress that squeezes a body of rock.\n- Causes the rock to bulge up and down.\n- Occurs at convergent plate boundaries.\n- Tension - Stress that stretches and pulls a body of rock apart.\n- Causes the rock to become thinner.\n- Occurs at divergent plate boundaries.\n- Shear Stress - Stress that distorts a body of rock by pushing parts in opposite directions.\n- Causes rock to bend, twist, or break apart.\n- Occurs at transform plate boundaries.\nStrain - Any change in a rock's shape or volume caused by stress.\n- If stress is applied slowly, the rock may regain its original shape once the stress is removed.\n- There are limits to how much stress a rock can endure before becoming permanently deformed.\n- Permanent Strains\n- Brittle strain results in cracks or fractures.\n- Ductile strain is change in volume or shape without breaking.\n- Strain is affected by...\n- type of rock\n- temperature & pressure (cooler and lower pressure tends to favor brittle strain)\n- amount of stress (higher favors brittle)\n- rate at which stress is applied (faster favors brittle)\nFold - A form of ductile strain in which rock layers bend; usually the result of a compression. (A form of ductile strain.)\n- Limbs - The sides of a fold.\n- Hinge - The bend where the limbs meet.\n- Axial plane - Divides the fold in half if it is symmetrical. (Most are not.)\n- Overturned fold seems to be laying in its side.\n- Types of Folds\n- Anticline - Oldest rock in center of fold. Usually arch-shaped.\n- Syncline - Youngest rock in center of fold. Usually bowl-shaped.\n- Monocline - Both limbs are nearly horizontal.\n- Folds can be small (handheld rock sample) or huge (parts of landscape that run for miles).\n- Large anticlines and synclines can form ridges and valleys.\nFracture - A break in a body of rock, along which there is no movement of surrounding rock.\nFault - A break in a body of rock, along which one block slides relative to another. (A form of brittle strain.)\n- Fault Plane - The plane/surface along which the motion occurs.\n- Hanging Wall - The rock above the fault plane (in a non-vertical fault).\n- Foot Wall - The rock below the fault plane.\n- Types of Faults\n- Normal Fault - Hanging wall moves downward. Common at divergent boundaries. (Great Rift Valley of East Africa)\n- Reverse Fault - Hanging wall moves upward. Common in mountain ranges formed by compression. (Rockies, Alps)\n- Thrust Fault - Low-angle (almost horizontal) reverse fault.\n- Strike-Slip Fault - Rock moves horizontally on either side of fault plane, due to shear stress. (San Andreas Fault)\nChapter 11, Section 2 - How Mountains Form\nMountain Range - A series of mountains that are closely related in orientation, age and mode of formation.\nMountain System - A group of adjacent mountain ranges. (Appalachian Mountain System = Great Smoky, Blue Ridge, Cumberland, Green and White Mountain Ranges)\nMountain Belt - Made up of groups of mountain belts.\n- Circum-Pacific Mountain Belt\n- Eurasian-Melanesian Mountain Belt\nPlate Tectonics & Mountain Formation\n- Continental & Oceanic Crust Collisions\n- Subduction of oceanic crust deforms rock on continental crust & uplifts mountains.\n- Subduction causes partial melting to produce magma, which may lead to volcanic mountains.\n- Examples: Cascade Range, Andes Mountains\n- Terranes may be scraped off the oceanic crust and added to continents, forming new mountains.\n- Oceanic & Oceanic Crust Collisions\n- The denser plate subducts under the other, causing partial melting. This leads to volcanic mountains.\n- Continental & Continental Crust Collisions\n- Neither plate subducts. Instead, the rocks deform to create mountains.\nTypes of Mountains\n- Folded Mountains\n- Formed when rock layers are squeezed together and uplifted.\n- Examples: Alps, Himalayas, Appalachians, and Ural Mountains.\n- Large, flat areas of rock, high above sea level.\n- Formed by same forces as folded mountains - thick layers of rock are slowly uplifted so that they don't fold or fault.\n- May also form when layers of lava build up and harden, or surrounding areas are eroded.\n- Fault-Block Mountains\n- Formed when the crust is broken into large blocks, and some of the blocks drop relative to others.\n- Examples - Sierra Nevada Mountains\n- Graben - Long, narrow valley formed by the same forces as fault-block mountains.\n- Dome Mountains\n- A circular structure, made of rock that slopes gently away from a central point.\n- Formed when magma rises through the crust, and pushes up on the rock layers above it.\n- Examples - Adirondack Mountains, NY and Black Hills, SD\n- Volcanic Mountains\n- Formed when magma erupts on to the surface.\n- Can occur along convergent plate boundaries.\n- Can occur along divergent boundaries.\n- Can occur at hot spots (volcanic areas found far from plate boundaries).\n- Pg. 312-313 #5-24, 34-36."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:80d89d7a-7296-4188-923d-6c1942ad826d>","<urn:uuid:45ab8df4-b6ff-4c89-9527-6c2f2d1c00f6>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key protection mechanisms for research partnerships, and how does Indian law regulate gene patents in this context?","answer":"In research partnerships, patents are the most frequently used intellectual property protection mechanism for both background and foreground knowledge. Other mechanisms are particularly important in early partnership stages to protect know-how. For gene patents specifically, Indian law under Section 3(c) states that mere isolation of naturally occurring genes cannot be patented. However, artificially developed genetically engineered microorganisms, vaccines, and recombinant DNA are patentable when they demonstrate novel and inventive steps with industrial applications.","context":["Intellectual property protection mechanisms in research partnerships\nA set of U.S.-based companies is investigated regarding the effectiveness of intellectual property protection mechanisms (IPPMs) in the formation of research partnerships. Patents are the most frequently used IPPM to protect both background and foreground knowledge in partnerships. Other IPPMs are used to protect know-how, especially in the early, forming stages of a partnership. Existing IP titles are quite useful when negotiating new partnerships.

Continuous and ongoing researches in genome projects, identifying specific target genes and their respective response and functional activities, have evolved genetic therapeutics in the treatment of multifactor disorders such as heart disease, diabetes, neurological disorders, muscular dystrophy and so and so forth.\nGene patents have been the most debated matter for years. The economic and policy issues surrounding patents on genes, gene sequences, nucleotide sequences, expressed sequence tags (ESTs), single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) have posed the potency to present unique challenges in science, innovations and legal fraternity around the globe.\nPatent Issues regarding Gene Patents:\nA number of gene/DNA sequence patents grew dramatically during the Human Genome Project. Researchers have obtained patents for isolating genes or gene sequences that occur in nature. Whether this should be permitted or not is still an open debate for decades.\nGenerally, to seek a patent-protected gene, there are certain issues that a researcher comes across.\n(1) Stop or avoid researching the particular gene;\n(2) License the rights to research the gene from the patent holder; or\n(3) Continue research regardless of legal liability.\nIndeed, the choice made is often dependent on the DNA sequence in question and the line of research pursued. Regardless, the exercise of any of these three options could potentially work to reduce fundamental R&D in human genetics.\nConsidering an instance of gene patent invalidation of Myriad Genetics by US federal court. The American Association of Pathologists and others have challenged several patents relating to the breast cancer genes BRCA1 and BRAC2 held by Myriad Genetics and the University of Utah Research Foundation. BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are associated with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer. The patent claimed products of nature, the law of nature, and naturally occurring phenomena. The US district court for the Southern District of New York upon a decision by Judge Robert Sweet invalidated Myriad’s patents. The decision that isolated but otherwise unaltered DNA should not be patentable is now being appealed by Myriad.\nThe US Government stated that:\n“The fact that a particular segment of the human genome codes for the BRCA1 protein in a human cell, for example, rather than for adrenaline or insulin or nothing at all, is not within the power of science to alter. Such basic natural relationships may not be the subject of a patent.” (Case 1:09-cv-04515-RWS)\nSecondly, it is been argued that Myriad patents and it is the sole provider of BRCA1/2 testing has highly hindered cancer patients to receive cancer genetic testing. It is impeded that genes are the natural heritage of animals and/or humans and its use should not be restricted by patent protection.\nIndian Patent Laws on genes:\nIndia, like other major countries, have immensely involved in various biotech and medical research area, being one of the topmost competitors in the commercial market in biological therapeutic and diagnostic domains globally\nSection 3(c) of the Indian Patent Act, states that “mere discovery of scientific principle or the formulation or the discovery of any living/nonliving substance occurring in nature” is not considered to be an invention. Pertaining to this law, mere isolation of naturally occurring genes from animal or plant body cannot be patentable.\nAccordingly, section 3 (i) define diagnostic methods is not patentable. Further, it explains that in vivo diagnostic methods practiced on human/animal bodies cannot be patentable but if the diagnosis is performed in vitro i.e. on tissue or fluids that have been removed from the body are entitled to be patentable in light of inventive measures. Hence, diagnostic methods employing DNA primers or probes or the like that are different from naturally occurring genes/DNA sequences that exhibit modified functions would be considered as patentable inventions. Considering Bilski (30 S.Ct. at 3225), new and useful methods of identifying, isolating, or using genes or genetic information may be patented (prohibiting patenting abstract ideas), that are basically man-made transformation or manipulation of the raw materials of the genome, such as cDNAs.\nSection 3(j) “plant and animals as a whole, seeds and species which involve in its propagation or biological processes are not considered to be patentable”. In addition to this section 3(j) also states that apart from naturally occurring embodies, living entities of artificial origin such as transgenic plants and animals and/or parts thereof are not patentable. Microorganisms are construed to be patentable under section 3 (j). However, section 3(j) and section (c) when combined, states that isolated microorganisms from naturally occurring bodies are not construed to be patentable. Nevertheless, artificially developed genetically engineered microorganisms, vaccines, and recombinant DNA is all considered to be patentable. For instance, as seen in the case-law of Diamond v. Chakrabarty, 447 U.S. 303 (1980), ruled that “anything under the sun that is made by man” is patentable. The Supreme Court established that the man-made products of genetic engineering are eligible for patent protection under 35 U.S.C. § 101. The Patent and Trademark Office responded to Chakrabarty by granting patents on a wide range of engineered DNA molecules and useful genetic methods.\nThe basic fact about genes/gene products being patentable is that when a genetically engineered gene/DNA/amino acid sequence is novel and holds an inventive step thereby ensuring its industrial application, the patents can be claimed as:\n- Gene sequence/amino acid sequence.\n- A method of expressing the above sequence.\n- An antibody against that sequence/protein.\n- A kit made from the antibody/sequence.\nIn a more brief sense, it should be noted that rDNA, plasmids, and process of forming the same are allowed to be patentable under substantive inventive steps employed. Further, unidentified functions of gene/DNA sequences and without any industrial application cannot be construed to be patentable.\nOne such example of gene patents in India, as seen in Indian Patent No. 243373 (279/MUM/2004) assigned to Sichuan Biotechnology Research Center, discloses artificial gene sequence for encoding recombinant super compound interferon with enhanced activity. The independent claim of the patent states:\n- A method for producing recombinant interferon for inhibiting HBV-DNA replication as well as secretion of HBsAg and HBeAg comprising steps of;\n- Synthesizing and interferon DNA having a sequence as depicted in Fig.1 or 2 designed according to the codon usage;\n- Placing said interferon DNA in an appropriate host preferably E.Coli and;\n- Expressing said recombinant interferon in a said host having an amino acid sequence encoded by interferon DNA shown in said Fig.1 or 2.\nWherein Fig 1 or 2 is a gene sequence of interferon DNA. (see Patent)\nAgain looking into Biocon’s story on genes, Using patent information as an integral tool, Biocon determined areas on which the company’s R&D should focus on. One such example is how the company used patent information to gain initial access to the field of human insulin production, where it is now a major player. The product patent on human insulin had long expired, but it was still protected by strong patents on processes of production.\nIn most prosecution cases, it is been observed that the examiner objects claims directed towards isolated DNA/gene sequences in context to section 3 (c). Such objections can be dealt sating that the applicant’s/individuals claimed isolated DNA/gene sequence is purely recombinant and in modified form and its functions are not identical to that occurring naturally. But nevertheless, there are certain granted patent claims where isolated DNA/gene sequences are not substantially different from that occurring in nature. Such claims have been granted based on the previous precedence of such issued claims.\nAbout the Author: Ms. Minusmita Ray, a Senior Patent Consultant in the Institute of Intellectual Property Research & Development (IIPRD) and can be reached: firstname.lastname@example.org."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:0191a10f-2b2e-4b24-be8c-575a57b2d3fb>","<urn:uuid:8aa56135-3a75-4074-b84b-a6de1f16f4c7>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the benefits of counting macronutrients for athletic performance, and what specific vitamin considerations should vegetarian athletes keep in mind?","answer":"Counting macronutrients can help athletes optimize their performance by adjusting ratios to meet their specific needs. Athletes often require 5-12 grams of carbohydrates per kilogram of body weight and 1.2-1.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, with recommended ratios of 45-65% carbohydrates, 10-35% protein, and 20-35% fat. As for vegetarian athletes, they must pay special attention to certain vitamins and minerals. They need to ensure adequate vitamin B12 intake through supplements or fortified foods since B12 is only available from animal products. They should also monitor their vitamin D levels, which can be maintained through fortified non-dairy milk and cereals, and be aware of potential iron deficiencies that could lead to lethargy and decreased performance.","context":["Counting macronutrients, which involves counting the amount of carbohydrate, fat, and protein that you are consuming, has become a popular method to monitor nutritional intake, reach desired health outcomes, and maintain a healthy and balanced diet.\nFoods are essentially made up of different ratios of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. We need to eat a combination of all three of these macronutrients to meet our nutritional needs and support bodily functions. But sometimes depending on our health goals, we may want to focus on certain macronutrients over others, or ensure we have the right type of a macronutrient in the diet. Counting macronutrients, ‘macros’ for short, can help you reach your health goals. Whether you’re looking to improve your diet, gain muscle, manage your weight, or improve your cardiometabolic health, counting macros may be the solution. (7)(9)(10)\nBenefits of counting macros\nThough studies have traditionally focused on how the overall intake of calories affects our health, other recent research demonstrates that the ratio of macronutrients (carbohydrates:fats:proteins) can influence cardiometabolic health, body composition, and longevity. (9)(17)\nCertain macronutrient ratios may improve cardiovascular and metabolic health. For example, the DASH diet (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension), which was developed as a method to lower blood pressure and improve cardiovascular health, recommends a low to moderate-fat approach, with an emphasis on lean proteins and fiber-rich carbohydrates (e.g., fruits, vegetables, whole grains). (3)\nModerate to low-carbohydrate diets are commonly recommended for individuals with diabetes or prediabetes as they may help regulate blood glucose (sugar) and blood lipid levels, as well as prevent or mitigate the risk of diabetic complications. (6)\nBody composition and weight management\nCounting macros is a popular method for weight loss and weight management. Research has shown that certain dietary patterns and macronutrient distributions can help individuals reach their goals. For example, low-fat diets may be beneficial for modest, sustained weight loss, whereas high-fat, low-carbohydrate diets may produce faster, more significant weight loss results. (7)(10) High-protein foods and diets are generally more satiating, helping you feel fuller for longer after a meal and thus preventing overeating. (16)\nMacro counting is also used by many athletes and individuals attempting to gain muscle mass or boost athletic performance. This may include adjusting macronutrient ratios to increase protein or carbohydrates, depending on their fitness and body composition goals. (11)(21)\nSome research suggests that macronutrient distribution plays a more significant role in longevity than does total caloric intake, suggesting that what you eat may be more important than how much you eat. (18)\nAlthough extensive evidence exists to suggest the importance of high protein intake in aging adults, (1) conflicting research proposes that a low-protein, high-carbohydrate diet may promote longevity. Residents of the Japanese island of Okinawa, who are among the longest-living people in the world, follow this type of dietary pattern, consuming approximately 85% and 9% of their total calories from carbohydrates and protein, respectively. (12) Unlike many North Americans, Okinawans and other Asian populations eat an abundance of vegetables and other high-fiber foods as their main carbohydrate sources. (19)(20) Diets high in fiber have been shown to contribute to lower risk of certain chronic conditions, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and cancer. (5)\nHow to count macros\nThe steps to calculating your macronutrient intake are outlined below.\nStep 1: Determine your caloric needs\nYour age, sex, weight, height, and activity level all play a role in determining optimal macronutrient ratios to maintain a healthy and balanced diet. Your optimal macronutrient intake also depends on your desired outcome. To simplify the process, there are a number of diet tracking wellness apps and online calculators that allow you to easily record and understand your daily macronutrient ratio and overall calorie intake. However, this should be used in conjunction with proper consultation with a healthcare practitioner who has nutritional expertise. Examples of highly-rated apps currently available on the App Store and Google Play Store include:\n- Lose It!\nIf you choose to manually calculate your macronutrient intake, the first step in determining the number of macros you need is to calculate your caloric needs. The simplest way to do this is to use an online calorie calculator that calculates your resting energy expenditure (REE) or basal metabolic rate (BMR). (15) These online calculators are available for free on many websites and mobile apps and help you calculate the number of calories that you would need to meet your daily intake per day based on your age, sex, weight, height, and perceived activity level.\nIt is important to note that these calorie calculators are based on statistical calculations that apply to the average population. While they may be useful for estimating caloric needs, your healthcare practitioners can provide more accurate caloric assessments. (4)\nStep 2: Consider the appropriate macronutrient ratio for you\nThe Acceptable Macronutrient Distribution Ranges (AMDR) represents the recommended macronutrient ratios for the average population according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans outlined by The Food and Nutrition Board of the Institutes of Medicine (IOM). The recommended macronutrient ratios according to the AMDR is as follows:\n- Carbohydrates: 45 to 65% of caloric intake\n- Protein: 10 to 35% of caloric intake\n- Fat: 20 to 35% of caloric intake (19)\nAs an example of demonstrating how to count your macros using the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommendations, assuming that you were ingesting 2000 calories per day with a macronutrient breakdown of 55% carbohydrates, 15% proteins, and 30% fats, you could determine the following:\n- 2000 cals * 0.55 = 1100 calories; 1100 kcal/4 calories per gram = ~275 g of carbohydrates\n- 2000 cals * 0.15 = 300 calories; 300 kcal/4 calories per gram = ~75 g of protein\n- 2000 calories * 0.30 = 600 calories; 600 kcal/9 calories per gram = ~66 g of fats\nThe amounts of each macronutrient outlined above represent the amount of each macro that you will need to ingest on a daily basis to meet your optimal ratio. Note that each gram of carbohydrate and protein contains approximately 4 calories and each gram of fat contains 9 calories. (19)\nConsiderations for special populations and diets\nKeep in mind, different populations may need to adjust their macronutrient ratios to meet their specific needs. For instance, athletes have different macronutrient needs than sedentary populations as they often expend more energy and have greater nutrient requirements for proper recovery. (13) It has been recommended that athletes primarily consume 5 to 12 grams of carbohydrates per kilogram of body weight and 1.2 to 1.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight, depending on the level of physical activity. (13) In general, athletes are recommended to break down their macros into the following ratios:\n- Carbohydrates: 45 to 65% of caloric intake\n- Protein: 10-35% of caloric intake\n- Fat: 20-35% of caloric intake (13)\nNotice that athletes are often advised to increase protein intake, reducing carbohydrates and fats, though this can also depend on the nature of their sport (e.g., endurance vs. sprint sports). Ingesting a higher ratio of protein can be challenging for certain individuals, such as vegetarians or vegans, since many protein sources are animal-based. However, there are many plant-based protein options that can be incorporated into a properly planned diet, which will assist in meeting protein requirements.\nOther diets may suggest varying macronutrient distributions depending on desired outcomes. For example, the ketogenic diet, which emphasizes a high-fat, moderate-protein, and low-carbohydrate approach for weight loss, may have a macronutrient distribution similar to the example below:\n- Carbohydrates: 5 to 10% of caloric intake\n- Protein: 30 to 35% of caloric intake\n- Fat: 55 to 60% of caloric intake (14)\nIn a high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diet, glucose stores are depleted, which results in the body utilizing fat stores for energy instead. This dietary pattern has been shown to promote weight loss, however long-term effects and likelihood of adherence to the diet are not well understood. (14)\nStep 3: Measure and track your macros\nThe final step to counting your macros is to track the weight of each food and beverage that you consume, using a food scale. You can also use the nutrient labels that appear on most food products to calculate the number of grams and calories of each macronutrient you are consuming. The mobile apps mentioned previously can be especially helpful for tracking foods that don’t have food labels, such as fruits, vegetables, meat, and poultry. These apps also make it easy to track multiple ingredients used in homemade meals and recipes. For help understanding a nutrition facts label, refer to the diagram below:\nIf you had a ⅔ cup serving of the food (55 g), you would have ingested 8 g of fat, 3 g of protein and 37 g of carbs (33 g apply when calculating calories as you can subtract the dietary fibers). For simple calculation, keeping the calorie estimates for each macronutrient can be done as follows:\n- Fat: 8 g * 9 kcal/g = 72 calories\n- Protein: 3 g * 4 kcal/g = 12 calories\n- Carbs: 33 g * 4 kcal/g = 132 calories\n- Total = 216 calories\nRemember, these calorie counts per gram are approximations and can vary by a few decimal points from food source to food source, so your final caloric calculations may slightly differ from the amount displayed on the nutrition label.\nIf you don’t want to do these calculations, you can always find an online food macro calculator or food journal which can tell you the amount of each macro in specific foods and beverages based on weight as well. You just need to make sure that the overall proportion of the macros that you ingest aligns with your caloric intake and your goals. Also, keep in mind that there’s a lot more to nutrition than the ratio or simply counting macronutrients; it’s just as important to consider the type and quality of protein, carbs, and fats you’re consuming.\nFor more information about macronutrients, visit the Fullscript blog.\nThe bottom line\nAll in all, the healthy way to go about counting your macros requires determining your caloric needs based on your physiological characteristics and goals. You then determine the amount of carbs, fats, and proteins in each food and liquid that you ingest using nutrition labels and weights and match these ratios with your predetermined macro goals. If you’re a patient, speak to your integrative healthcare provider to determine if counting macros is right for you and your health goals.\n- Baum, J., Kim, I.-Y., & Wolfe, R. (2016).

Since this is not always possible, some vegetarians choose to supplement their diet with vitamins to ensure adequate nutrients for performance and recovery. Vegetarians must take extra care to avoid deficiencies of iron, calcium, zinc, vitamin B12, and vitamin D, which can hurt exercise and strength training performance.\nNOTE: Please consult your doctor to be tested on before taking supplements. The information below explains what may be lacking in a vegetarian runner’s diet.\nVitamin B12 is essential to vegetarian runners because red blood cells are so important to muscle repair, oxygen delivery, blood lactate clearance, and other mechanisms associated with continued, injury-free physical activity. Since vitamin B12 is available only from animal products, it is one of the most common nutrients missing from the diets of vegetarian athletes. If vegetarians don’t obtain their B12 requirements from food, they are advised to take B12 supplements. Vitamin B12 absorption becomes less efficient as we age, so supplements may also be needed by older vegetarians.\nNo active form of vitamin B12 is found naturally in plant foods (including soy products), however, if you eat dairy products and eggs they will provide you with sufficient amounts of vitamin B12. There are also fortified foods such as some soy beverages and some vegetarian sausages and burgers. Mushrooms, tempeh, miso, and sea vegetables are often claimed to be a source of B12, however, they actually contain a compound with a similar structure to B12 but it doesn’t work like B12 in the body.\nThe main source of vitamin D is sunlight so vegetarians may require a dietary source of vitamin D when sun exposure is insufficient. There are few foods that contain significant amounts of vitamin D which means there is very little vitamin D in most people’s diets unless they eat fatty fish, eggs, liver or vitamin D fortified foods (such as margarine). Vitamin D deficiency can be avoided by choosing fortified nondairy milks and breakfast cereals as well. Vegetarians may wish to choose these and other animal-based vitamin D supplements.\nVegetarian diets are usually high in iron from plant foods, although this iron is not absorbed as well as the iron in meat. Vegetarian athletes are at more risk of iron deficient anemia than non-vegetarian athletes who eat red meat and should be aware that underlying iron deficiencies can be noticeable in athletes as they become more lethargic and their performance decreases.\nGood food sources of iron include green leafy vegetables, peas and whole grains, enriched cereals and legumes. Combining these foods with foods high in vitamin C and food acids, such as fruit and vegetables, will help your body absorb the iron. Some foods contain substances that block the absorption of iron in the intestine. Coffee, whole grains, bran, legumes, and spinach all interfere with iron absorption and should be combined with vitamin C to increase iron absorption.\nCooking in cast iron cookware every once and a while rather than stainless steel can leach absorbable iron into simmering food. Look at also taking iron supplements but be careful that too much iron can be toxic. Speak to a well-qualified nutritionist or dietician if you are unsure.\nSome reports say that vegetarians have a lower zinc levels than non-vegetarians. This may be due to the fact that cereals, legumes, nuts, soy products and eggs are secondary sources of zinc. However, there is no suggestion that vegetarian athletes need to include zinc supplements in the diet. The best vegetarian sources of zinc are nuts, tofu, miso, legumes, wheat germ and wholegrain foods.\nCalcium is necessary for strong bones and teeth, as well as to help muscles relax and contract and nerves conduct messages. Good vegetarian sources of calcium include dairy products, fortified cereals and fruits juices, fortified soymilk, tahini and some brands of tofu. Leafy dark green vegetables (especially Asian greens), legumes, almonds and Brazil nuts also contain calcium."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a4357236-4bb3-4fa8-986c-9e13336bd6a9>","<urn:uuid:de6f5725-27aa-4861-9f9d-9b7aa8133d40>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Hey there! 🤔 I'm curious about different types of certifications for ethical businesses - what's the main difference between B-Corp certification and Fair Trade certification? Would love to understand how they compare!","answer":"B-Corp and Fair Trade certifications serve different purposes. B-Corp certification, administered by B-Lab, focuses on overall company practices across five categories: governance, workers, community, environment, and customers. Companies are evaluated through the B Impact Assessment, which measures their social and environmental performance. Fair Trade certification, on the other hand, specifically focuses on equitable trade relationships and fair compensation in supply chains, particularly for producers in the Global South. It includes requirements for fair labor practices, environmental standards, and price premiums paid to producers. While B-Corp certification looks at a company's overall social and environmental impact, Fair Trade certification specifically addresses trade relationships and producer compensation in global supply chains.","context":["Spend enough time in the social impact space, and you’re bound to hear the concept of “B-Corps” come up again and again. But what exactly is a Benefit Corporation, and why is the concept so important to the conversation around business as a force for good?\nBroadly speaking, businesses traditionally fell into one of two categories: they were either for-profit or nonprofit. For-profit companies were driven to maximize financial returns, while nonprofits relied on outside fundraising and donations to operate. With no social impact requirements for for-profits, and no ability for nonprofits to use the power of the market, the two camps remained firmly planted on opposite ends of the spectrum.\nMeanwhile, a historic global culture shift was already underway to harness the power of business to help address society’s greatest challenges. People were realizing that the business community could be part of the solution to global problems like wealth inequality, climate change, and social unrest.\nAgainst this backdrop, in 2006, three friends set out to explore a third option – almost a hybrid of the two, that would allow businesses to use the power of the market as a force for social and environmental good. They founded a nonprofit called B-Lab with the goal of accelerating that cultural shift to bring about an inclusive, equitable and regenerative economic system for all people and the planet.\nThe advocacy work done by B-Lab and its partners helped bring a new legal entity into existence: the Benefit Corporation.\nThe Benefit Corporation As a Concept\nIn the MovingWorlds Institute, we educate Fellows that a social enterprise is often a B Corp (not all social enterprises are B Corps, and in almost all cases, all B Corps are social enterprises). Specifically, B Corps have targets in five categories of responsible operating practices: Governance, workers, community, environment, and customers.\nIn setting targets and showing progress in these five areas, benefit corporations grow to create social good, manage their externalities, contribute to their communities, care for the planet, and ensure they are treating workers equitably.\nThe Benefit Corporation as a Legal Entity\nA benefit corporation, sometimes called a “B Corp,” is a for-profit corporation that commits to create a material positive impact on society and the environment from the business and operations of the corporation. As CooleyGo explains, “Like a traditional corporation, it pursues profit for the benefit of its shareholders, but a benefit corporation must also report on how it pursues a positive social environmental impact.” The table below outlines some of the other key differences between Benefit Corporations and traditional corporations:\nAnother advantage of the benefit corporation structure is that it gives entrepreneurs the freedom to define success beyond profit for their businesses, and protect their mission through changes in ownership and leadership by baking it right into their articles of incorporation.\nIs the option to incorporate as a Benefit Corporation available everywhere?\nThe short answer is: no. However, that is changing. In the United States, some version of the Benefit Corporation has been adopted in over 30 states plus the District of Columbia, but the actual name of these entities varies by state. In Washington State, for example, Benefit Corporations are called “Social Purpose Corporations.”\nSimilar legal structures are gaining momentum internationally as well. The United Kingdom offers an option called a “Community Interest Company,” with similar features to ensure it’s operating for the benefit of the community. Social Enterprise UK is an example of a Community Interest Company working to further the social enterprise movement.\nBringing this kind of legal structure or its equivalent to more parts of the world is a big part of B-Lab’s ongoing work. As its website explains, “B Lab works with our partners around the world to identify countries where corporate law impedes mission driven entrepreneurs. B Lab works with local experts to identify legal pathways for mission-aligned companies to consider impact over time. A key component of B Lab’s impact thesis is that accountability is fundamental to driving positive impact over the long-term. Companies can only consider impact over time if they are legally allowed (and even required) to do so. Building on the success of benefit corporation legislation in the U.S., B Lab is already working with governments in several countries to create and implement mission-aligned structures and working in all its regions to promote their use.”\nIn Latin America, for example, Sistema B promotes B Corps and other economic actors in Latin America in order to build a new economy, in which success and financial benefits include social and environmental well-being. Organizations with the same goal of furthering business as a force for good include Social Traders in Australia and Euclid in Europe.\nLegislation is already moving forward in Australia, Argentina, Chile, and Canada. For information on these legislative efforts, you can contact firstname.lastname@example.org.\nWhat’s the difference between a Benefit Corporation and a “Certified B-Corp”?\nThe B-Lab certification is similar to other certifications, like “Fair Trade” or “USDA Organic.” Most certified B-Corps will have this icon somewhere on their website:\nAny organization that is incorporated as a benefit corporation is a B-Corp. But for organizations in places where those legal structures aren’t available, or even organizations who are incorporated as a B-Corp but want an extra layer of accountability, Certification is a third-party service administered by the non-profit B Lab, based in part on a company’s verified performance on the B Impact Assessment.\nThe B Impact Assessment is a free, confidential tool that any business can use to start measuring and managing its social and environmental impact. Dimensions covered in the assessment include:\n- Mission & Engagement\n- Ethics & Transparency\n- Mission Locked Impact Business Model\n- Financial Security\n- Health, Wellness, & Safety\n- Career Development\n- Engagement & Satisfaction\n- Diversity, Equity, & Inclusion\n- Economic Impact\n- Civic Engagement & Giving\n- Environmental Management\n- Air & Climate\n- Land & Life\n- Environmental Education & Information Impact Business Model\n- Customer Stewardship\n- Education Impact Business Model\n- Economic Empowerment for the Underserved\n- Support for Underserved/Purpose-Driven Enterprises\n- Serving Underserved Populations (Indirect)\nStep 1 is taking the assessment. You have the option to answer fewer questions in about 30 minutes to get a quick snapshot, or to dedicate a few hours to answering all of the questions for a full impact report. Once you’ve completed the assessment, you can then compare your performance against thousands of other businesses to see how you measure up. Finally, you can create a customized improvement plan for your business and use B-Lab’s free best practice guides to help you implement.\nA benefit corporation is a legal structure, a certification, and a global movement. At its core, being a benefit corporation means that you exist for some public benefit – whether that’s social or environmental. As the B-Corp movement continues to gain momentum, new legal structures will continue to become available that balance profit with purpose.

You will also see “Fair Trade,” two words and capitalized, referring to the U.S.-based organization, standards, and initiatives. When the word “Fairtrade” (close up) is written, it implies involvement of FLO, or Fairtrade Labeling Organization International, which is generally known as Fairtrade International.\nConfusing, right? Yeah, we know. That’s why this next section exists.\nThere are many ways to describe or define what Fair Trade/Fairtrade means, but the most common one you will likely hear is something simplified along the lines of “it means the producer is paid more money for their work or product,” and often what the speaker means is that there is a built-in price premium for simply holding some form of Fair Trade or Fairtrade certification. This is true: Goods that carry Fair Trade/Fairtrade certification do come with a price premium—but that isn’t the only function of this cert. It is also a mark that carries implication regarding fair labor use (no child or bonded labor, for example), environmentally sound practices, and—historically perhaps the most significant aim—the desire to empower smallholder farmers by encouraging them to band together in order to gain more market access and leverage. (More on this last point in just a moment.)\nWhy is this premium price important? Good question, thanks for asking!\nIn the 1940s, as a response to the cycles of exploitation and abuse that arose from increasingly globalized capitalism, many religious, charitable, and/or non-governmental organizations began seeking to develop more equitable supply chains between consumers and producers—specifically producers in the Global South, or countries that had been negatively economically affected by colonialism. Business models like Ten Thousand Villages grew out of this early push, selling art, crafts, textiles, and other handmade items in order to solicit donations that would be used to strengthen those supply chains at their country of origin.\nThroughout the 1960s and specifically in Europe, politicized pushback against the continued exploitation of labor through international trade gave rise to a “Trade not Aid” philosophy that saw the emergence of alternative trade initiatives (so-called “fair trade”) designed to bypass complicated chains of custody by connecting buyers and sellers more directly through business networks, shops, catalogs, and other highly specialized means. Alternative trade organizations like Oxfam came into being at this time.\nThen, in the late 1980s, consumer demand for credibility and traceability led to the transformation of the fair trade concept into something more standardized, recognizable, and easily distributable across multiple (rather than specialized)channels. The first official alternative trading certification, called Max Havelaar, was established in Holland in 1988 and named for a 19th-century Dutch novel about the horrors of the Indonesian coffee trade under Dutch colonial control. This was the first certification that allowed certified products and to be sold in mainstream shops, as opposed to being limited to fair-trade-only marketplaces.\nThe rest of Europe and the United States took inspiration from Max Havelaar, and the 1990s saw several new international initiatives to solidify and legitimize the fair trade philosophy. Fairtrade Labeling Organizations International (FLO International) came into being in 1997, creating an amalgamation of like-minded certification organizations around the world and attempting to standardize them along the lines of their policies and procedures.\nFairtrade International (FLO) is the longest-standing standard-setting body, and its certification arm (FLO-CERT) is the oldest entity of its type. In 2012, the United States’ standard-setting body, Fair Trade USA, split off from FLO in order to create and support its own set of certification requirements and prerequisites.\nThe primary ideological difference between Fair Trade USA and Fairtrade International is that FLO certification is only available to smallholder producers who belong to democratically run associations or cooperatives, while FTUSA recognizes cooperatives as well as individual and large-scale producers. (Fair Trade USA defines “small-scale” as those farms that have 0–5 permanent workers and less than 25 total workers; large-scale operations have more than 25 permanent workers or more than 100 total workers.)\nThis last point is relatively key to understanding the evolution of the movement and philosophy behind fair trade: Perhaps the pivotal tenet of Fairtrade International was the initiative to encourage smallholder farmers to simulate an economy of scale by banding together into associations and cooperatives with democratic leadership. This aspect of the movement was intended to provide them with greater access to a competitive marketplace, create pathways for producers to share and pool resources, and to provide greater transparency and traceability to producers who have historically had their products sold anonymously and for little (if any) profit back to their pockets. To this day, FLO certifies only smallholder farmers who are affiliated with democratically operated grower groups, as the benefits to the collective action and advocacy has always been the primary goal.\nFair Trade USA, on the other hand, asserts that individual and even large-scale plantation operations should be eligible for certification, which makes FTUSA’s primary focus more about the other standards (agrochemical abatement, labor protections, etc), as well as the premium associated with the certification, and the guaranteed security that comes with the floor price.\nProducers who are interested in becoming certified will need to apply and be audited, which means first needing to comply with the requirements of FLO-CERT, FTUSA, or other overseeing entity. The process might take several months or longer depending on how much current operations need to change in order to be compliant.\nCertification costs will also vary based on the complexity of the process: For example, organizations will likely need to make investments in their operations both on the group level and the individual farm level in order to achieve certification compliance, which will add expenses above and beyond the cost of the application and auditing. Auditing costs will also vary based on the number of producers and contracted labor, and more.\nThe initial and annual fees to the certifying organization are paid per unit, such as 3c/lb.\nSellers (such as Cafe Imports) also need to be registered with the Fair Trade/Fairtrade certifying bodies in order to prove our own compliance (e.g. that we are paying the proper premiums and using the seals and logos appropriately). Roasters who want to sell items that are labeled as Fair Trade/Fairtrade will need to do the same and can do so by filling out an application with their preferred entity.\nIs Fair Trade Coffee Better?\nAs with any other certification, model, philosophy, and practice in specialty coffee, there is no cut-and-dry answer to this question: We encourage our customers to take some of the significant pros and cons of this certification into consideration before coming to a conclusion.\nThere are certainly benefits to Fair Trade/Fairtrade certification, including:\nOf course, there are the drawbacks as well:\nWhat about Direct Trade?\nWhile they sound somewhat similar, direct trade (you’ll notice the lowercase letters) is not a certification, but rather a broad and unstandardized range of sourcing strategies and philosophies. It’s a great question, though, and one that warrants further investigation: We’ll dedicate a later post in this series to direct trade, so stay tuned!\nCan I Sell Fair Trade–Certified Coffee?\nAbsolutely! You are welcome to buy any Fair Trade– or Fairtrade-certified green coffee from our offerings list in order to roast and re-sell it. In order to use the corresponding certification marks, however, there are a few guidelines.\nFairtrade International requires any business using their certification marks to sign a licensing contract: The Fairtrade guidelines for sellers is located on its website here. Fair Trade USA also requires its business partners to register as re-sellers: The process also starts with an online form.\nCafe Imports and our sister small-bag company, La Bodega, are both certified buyers and re-sellers of Fairtrade (FLO)- and Fair Trade USA–certified coffees. If you purchase certified coffees from us via either of these outlets, you are welcome to use certain language to describe the coffees’ production and trade history, but you will only be permitted to use the official certification logos if your own company is registered with the corresponding entity.\nStill have questions? We’re always happy to talk about Fairtrade/Fair Trade certification and compliance!

{"question":"¿Qué diferencias hay entre los túneles de Madrid y Estocolmo en cuanto a su propósito principal? 🤔","answer":"While Madrid's tunnels (Madrid Rio M30) were primarily built to transform a highly trafficked urban area into a family-friendly park by moving traffic underground through 43 kilometers of tunnels, Stockholm's tunnel project is mainly focused on solving severe traffic congestion problems. Stockholm's project, which will be one of Europe's largest road tunnels, aims to create a new half-ring dual three-lane motorway that will help address the city's growing congestion issue, where it can sometimes take hours to get home by car due to limited crossing points between the city's two main areas.","context":["The need for sustainable urban development that benefit people, the economy and the environment is ever present. By understanding the value of green urban spaces we can avoid short-circuiting the development of our cities. Here's how we do it.\nCurrently, more than half the world's population lives in cities. It has been estimated that, over the next 30 years, surging populations will require sustainable urban planning and the construction of new urban areas to accommodate an extra three billion people.\nExplosive population growth will create challenges such as containing traffic congestion, which costs society billions, and fashioning an infrastructure that enables mobility and access to green urban spaces for all citizens.\nThese challenges require long-term, coherent infrastructure solutions that do more than keep the traffic flowing smoothly. The solutions must consider climate change and enable urban development that supports the health and well-being of urban dwellers in the face of increasing population pressure. And they must do it in an economically responsible manner.\nMany large cities have already addressed these challenges and invested in new, welcoming urban spaces.\nFor example, Madrid has completed an extensive infrastructure project, Madrid Rio M30, which has transformed a worn and highly trafficked urban area along the river into a family-friendly park. The previously intense traffic has been moved underground, into 43 kilometres of tunnels. In addition, several metro lines have been built to relieve the city’s dense traffic. In Madrid, as in several other cities, it has been possible to move people to other forms of transportation, without eliminating car traffic.\nIn Oslo, the southern ring road has been converted into a tunnel across the harbour (Bjørvika), creating a recreational area along the edge of the harbour. This has created a unique connection between the city and the water, to the delight of many.\nSimilarly, in Stockholm, putting the new northern ring road underground has created a recreational area north of the ring road, with a connection to the city south of the ring road. Currently, Forbifart Stockholm reroutes traffic west of the city in more than 20 kilometres of tunnels, and the upcoming Eastern Connection tunnel will further support mobility in the Swedish capital.\nCommon to these projects is the realisation that investing in tunnels – and the introduction of user payment to recoup the investment – has improved traffic conditions and created some wonderfully attractive parks and urban spaces where people can meet their fellow citizens in the open air.\nTunnels have improved traffic conditions and created some wonderfully attractive parks and urban spaces where people can meet their fellow citizens in the open air.\nIn Copenhagen, urban development is also picking up speed, with Metro Cityringen, adding 17 new metro stations and urban spaces; a new Copenhagen–Ringsted railway; and the construction of Nordhavnsvejen (Nordhavn Road), with the subsequent extension of the Nordhavn tunnel to Nordhavn. These major infrastructure projects create a better framework for mobility as well as new and exciting urban spaces.\nHowever, ensuring a sustainable urban development is facing obstacles in cities around the world. A major challenge is that investing in green spaces is rarely economically viable according to the traditional socio-economic models. This is especially true when spaces are created by building traffic tunnels – increasingly seen as the most efficient way of creating elbow room for citizens, as more people move to cities.\nIn a time of intensified struggle for public resources, political opposition to user payment in some countries and cutting-edge cost–benefit analyses, our experience is that major investment in green urban development is often doomed before it even gets started.\nThe pertinent questions are: What value can be put on green spaces? Do city dwellers who exercise in the parks and other green areas have fewer health problems and so are less of a burden on the healthcare system? Is human well-being improved by replacing grey concrete with more aesthetically pleasing habitats? Will children play with other children more often in the parks rather than sitting at home alone with electronic devices? Does that have a socio-economic value?\nThere are many questions, but very few answers, simply because research and tools are lacking in this field. When it comes to the blue elements in a city, for example, investment in climate adaptation, we see valuations growing, because the investment is compared with the enormous sums that insurance companies will have to pay for flood damage and other destructive consequences of climate change.\nThe risk is that societal investments fail to harvest benefits of green infrstructure because the economic valuation methodology is incomplete.\nSustainable solutions must include economic, environmental, and social conditions. It is possible to achieve sustainable urban development that both provide valuable green spaces and solve traffic congestion, as well as downpour and flood protection as part of climate adaptation. That's the way to provide a comprehensive decision support to politicians governing the development of cities around the world.\nCities are already taking important and progressive steps in this direction, but continuous realisation of these investments requires long-term thinking, accommodation of all forms of traffic - both current and future - and the inclusion of citizen demands for vibrant and attractive urban environments.","After years of preparation and design, blasting and rock moving for Sweden’s largest infrastructure project began south of the city this year. It sets in train a decade-long project that will create a new half-ring dual three-lane motorway for the city, 20km long. With most of it deep underground, it will also be one of Europe’s largest ever road tunnels. The scheme is aimed at transforming a growing congestion problem for Sweden’s capital which can be a highly frustrating city for residents trying to move around, and especially those in the south wanting to work in the north or, vice versa. “In medieval times the water was a means of movement but nowadays it is an obstacle,” said Jesper Niland, technical manager for the project client, the Swedish Road Authority.\n“At times it can seem like there are almost two cities and getting from one to the other is a major difficulty” added overall project director, Johan Brantmark. After just a day or two in the city the snarl-ups are obvious with traffic jams almost constant for extended rush hours. It can sometimes take hours to get home by car.\nThe impact of the congestion is mainly within Stockholm itself, affecting the 2.2 million or so people living in the Stockholm metropolitan area. There is passing traffic heading to the relatively unpopulated north but that is currently fairly limited and some 95% of the traffic is local. “It either starts or finishes in the city or both,” said Brantmark.\nThe introduction of a congestion charge some years ago lowered traffic volumes, but not sufficiently to fully address the congestion problem. Rail links that could help are also overextended, although a new “City Banan” central train line will open next year. But though the new line doubles the current twin-track line capacity of the central station, it will only partially meet demand.\nThe problem arises from the geography of the city, which sits between the edge of the Baltic archipelago and several large inland lakes and further associated islands. It is a beautiful setting, and makes Stockholm one contender for the perhaps overworked “Venice of the North” designation, with all its waterways. But it also means the city is split in two by a large channel.\n“And there are only three links across,” said Brantmark. One of these is around the central island of the old city, where “the Sluice” separates the lake and the Baltic, and another on a bridge over the lake. “But the only high-capacity crossing is the E4 route on the west side.”\nNot only does this restrict traffic, it leaves the transport network vulnerable, he said. “If a bridge is damaged, and we have had some incidents of barge collisions or if repairs are needed, the impact is significant.”\nThe proposed solution is a new motorway link which will essentially reroute the E4 motorway west of the capital, running south to north, and joining to a new northern link running eastwards across the city. Together with an eventual southern section this will make a half ring outer motorway. The eastern half is not needed as that would put it in the Baltic Sea.\nThe old E4 will remain but redesignated as a local road and with reduced traffic loads. “These are currently about 110,000 vehicles/day,” said Brantmark. The new route is expected to see traffic volumes increase up to 140,000 vehicles/day, some 10 years after it opens in 2026.\nBut passing the road westwards has been fraught with problems, and some political objections, which for a while suspended the project while its go-ahead was debated. Most of these issues are environmental; contesting the overall existence of the road itself and its location.\nFor many “greens” the new road, which began significant design work in 2011, was seen as encouraging and perhaps stimulating traffic growth. That would be causing unacceptable emissions at a time of global warming; investment should instead go on new metros.\n“A new government in 2014 therefore made a reassessment of the project but eventually decided it should go ahead,” said Brantmark, “not least because the city is quite rapidly growing.”\nA second issue is the potential damage to some relatively pristine areas the route must cross, including several lake waterways and a large island, Lovön, which includes a royal palace and is mostly parkland over the rest of its area.\n“The result is that, as the decades have gone by, an original proposed scheme mostly above ground has been more and more put underground,” said Niland. The central part of the scheme will now be a single underground section 16.5km long with a further 1.8km tunnel section to the north after a junction with an existing motorway. There are short at-grade sections at the end too.\nNot only is the scheme very long for an urban tunnel but it will also drop fairly deep, as much as 65m below sea level, to ensure that it can pass beneath the water channels and any cracks and fissures there might be in Sweden’s very hard rock.\nAnd it will be huge; a twin bore tunnel for a full motorway of three lanes in each direction and associated safety shoulders. The total width of the two rock bores is 16m. Along with the main tunnel there must also be a large number of approach and leaving ramps for various junctions, including one at each end linking into the existing E4; one at the north end between the two tunnels sections where the E18 route passes east to west; and two intermediate junctions, one on the island of Lovön and another in an urban area north of that. As these junctions will also be partly underground, an additional 14km of ramp tunnel is needed, as well as further work for seven access tunnels.\nThe junctions are significant projects in themselves, particularly the Häggvik junction in the north and the Kungens Kurva, where the road ties into the existing motorway at the southern end, each having multi-lane sections and major bridge and ramp structures above ground as well as below.\nThe challenges in carrying through these projects are not simply the design of the structures themselves and their construction but also the need to keep the existing traffic flowing freely, or at least as freely as it can be said to flow at present.\n“Safety, and security are the top watchwords for the project,” explained Brantmark, “and that includes avoiding any disruption of the circulation or making the network any more vulnerable. Keeping the vehicle users free from extra stress is important.”\nThe junction contracts, currently being let after a long international tendering period, are therefore to be done on a design-build principle. The aim is to encourage innovation from the contractors, particularly with temporary works and traffic management.\n“The tunnel works are done differently. As with all tunnels we follow the principle that the ground conditions can be variable and are therefore the responsibility of the client, more or less in line with the British code of practice which evolved after the Heathrow tunnel collapse.”\nDesign will be done by the client, with the contractor responsible for implementation. Extensive geotechnical investigation and coring has been done to assess rock quality.\nSweden has long experience in hard rock tunnelling and this obviously informs the design of the project, which will be carried out by traditional drill and blast methods. The rock is primarily a granitic gneiss, commonplace throughout the ancient rocks of the Baltic Shield.\nIn Sweden the basic excavation technique always includes extensive pre-grouting of the rock on most projects, ensuring that cracks and fissures are sealed and the rock is “tight” to fairly severe limits of water leakage.\nThat is especially important on this route where there is a reasonable level of fracturing and cracks in the rock said Niland, not least from the lake bed sections above.\nThough it takes longer to do things this way, “…it is usually quite successful and means the requirements for lining the rock tunnel against water ingress are reduced,” said Brandt, who holds a doctorate in rock mechanics himself.\nA major issue to come will be blasting vibrations particularly in the southern sector and further north where the tunnels pass underneath urban areas and buildings. Rock transmits vibrations rather too well. Some mitigation measures are already underway including the mass double glazing of a housing estate near to one of the sites for a junction.\nNot all the tunnelling will be in hard rock however, and there are sections particularly, as ramps approach the surface, which most cope with clays and glacial tills laid down during the Ice Age.\nThe tunnel itself has some modern features, most notably an inner envelope set around half a metre in from the rock excavation walls. “This is to make an inner seal and also to set a good shape for the tunnel interior,” explained Niland. It is made using a flexible membrane supported on rock bolts standing out from the bare rock walls and then coated with layers of shotcrete to form a rigid shell.\n“The older method was a drainage mat and shotcrete on the rock but this offers better control of water leaks,” said Niland.\nHe explained that the space outside the shell is inaccessible. But for later maintenance a newly developed semi-robotic scanner is being modified from one used at present for the London Underground, to pick up any changes in the rock profile over the years.\nSweden famously pays a lot of attention to road safety – the Volvo car is known for it, and the design of the tunnel will reflect that. The major feature is a cross-passage system linking the two sides allowing for evacuation in the event of a fire or crash and for the access of emergency services from vehicles in the opposite carriageway. The relatively small passages are sealed with pressure doors and contain communication links, firefighting equipment and water hydrant points.\n“The principle is ‘self-evacuation’ through short but frequent tunnels,” said Niland. The cross-passages will be made every 100m which is much above the 300m level common in many modern tunnel systems such as the Gotthard high speed, and even more above the European minimum of 500m.\nThe cross-passage system is part of a tunnel fire system that includes heat and smoke detectors and emergency radio communications network.\nVentilation is another important aspect of the tunnel safety both in emergencies and during normal operation. With an anticipated 140,000 vehicles/day, keeping the air clean and safe presents a significant challenge.\nSurprisingly the design has gone for a longitudinal system using ceiling mounted jet-flow fans, where the fan output drags the rest of the tunnel air along. For very long tunnels over 4km it is more normal to provide a system using under road or ceiling ducts, drawing in or pushing air out through slots.\nSuch tranverse systems need more structure however and more complex air flow and control.\n“We are able to use a longitudinal system because the tunnel has been broken into sections,” said Niland. “Every 4km there is an air exchange station which draws fresh air from the surface through a vent and discharges stale air through another. We had a lot of discussion on this and design and modelling studies.”\nThe 8m diameter intake and out-take vents are spaced 100m apart and will require some major raise boring work to reach the surface from the 65m depth of the tunnels. They are fitted with big tranverse fans, some 48 in all, complementing 250 jet fans in the tunnels. Additional smoke extraction-only vents to the surface will be provided near the tunnel entrances.\nTaken together, the system and associated air quality, smoke and air temperature detectors, will allow a fairly high level of control over different sections of the tunnel and also a means to isolate smoke and heat from fires.\nA water sprinkler system will also come into play in the event of fires, says Brandt.\nAnother safety aspect for the tunnel will be an architectural interior finish and variated lighting to change the appearance of the tunnel for drivers as they pass through. However, 16km is a long drive underground and ways to keep drivers alert are needed.\nThat comes later. A more pressing issue is the 19 million tonnes of rock spoil that will emerge from the tunnel network as blasting really gets underway. Though some truck transport will be used, most of the route is environmentally protected.\n“So most of the spoil will be removed by water transport,” said Niland. Rock spoil inside the tunnel will be moved to crushers sited underground, to limit noise and dust, and then sized spoil will go by conveyor to one of three jetties which are being built for loading bulk transport ships. The client has purchased the sites for those and has also made arrangement with three buyers to sell the spoil. As a hard granite there is no difficulty in finding users for concrete making and other aggregate purposes. Some will go north and some south, said Niland.\n“We have taken these measures as the client to ensure a level playing field for the bids,” he added, “because the local contractors tend to have arrangements already in place for this kind of disposal.”\nSome of the earlier works for access tunnels are underway at present with smaller contracts in the US$50 million range, Czech contractor Subterra has one for example. But many of the main bids are still in progress for the major contracts, which are up to $300 million. There are six for the junctions and another half dozen for the main tunnelling works which get underway in earnest next year.\nThe client split the jobs into these packages to ensure the market could cope said Brantmark, “…though in the event it seems we could have gone bigger – some offers for discounts to take two packages have been received.”\nThere could be some delays for the moment however because several of the big contracts are being contested in the courts at present over award procedures.\nThese major tunnelling works are expected to continue until 2022. After that comes the mechanical and electrical and ventilation works and installation of the control systems, signalling, lighting and signage.\nPossibly by then the technology will have further advanced and it is difficult at this stage to be precise about the details. Current opening schedule is mid-2026.\nA key element of the project has been the decision by the Swedish government’s Roads Authority to make the project a full Building Information Modelling project (World Highways Software supplement 2012). It is the first major project done this way in the country and a step towards full BIM procedures for the future.\nImplementation of the BIM system has been part of a design exercise carried out since 2011 by a consulting joint venture of Sweden’s ÅF and international consultant URS, now part of the Aecom group.\nThe team, together with the Trafikverkert, (Sweden’s Road and Rail Authority), has developed a complex set of protocols and procedures for design development and communication, together with a methodology for publishing and passing on information.\nA “common data environment” is part of this, where documents are tracked and versioned very carefully. Bentley‘s ProjectWise server system has been used to implement that along lines used on the London Crossrail project.\nAt the heart of the new system is full use of 3D models for both design and tendering of the project, and then it is hoped, the development and passing on of models as construction proceeds.\nThere is still the use of drawings for some early parts, according to Trafikverkert, which added that the electronic model has a priority in the hierarchy of the contract process.\nThe client does not insist that contractors use the model for their own procedures if they do not wish. Contractors can extract drawings for site work for example. But the client wants the communications carried out using 3D information. It hopes the models will be passed on with added as built information, potentially all the way to the asset management stage of the project.\nA key aspect is that any exchange must be software vendor neutral and for the moment that is handled by using the more common file formats like DNG and DWG as well as XML. These are integrated as a common federated model using the I-model system.\nAlthough the system will put Sweden at the forefront in using electronic models it is still only a level two BIM says one of the Aecom engineers involved. But a full common 3D model is the target.\nAnother continuing aspect of the project as it enters the construction stage is the developing use of simpler apps and systems to extract and use information on site via “Cloud” applications like Navisworks 360. This is likely to evolve as the scheme gets into full swing."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:05af48bb-41a3-4fd3-a2a2-dfccf16177d8>","<urn:uuid:bbfadca3-64e6-439f-9b2d-e7e587ec91ee>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm planning two celebrations next month. What's the key difference in timing between planning a baby shower and organizing a baptism ceremony?","answer":"A baby shower requires dedicated planning over 4 weeks, with specific tasks broken down week by week, including organizing (week 1), invitations and entertainment (weeks 2-3), and final details (week 4). In contrast, for a baptism ceremony, there is no specific timeline mentioned - you simply need to contact the church office to plan the baptism of your child. The baptism is a single ceremonial rite focused on joining the church community, while a baby shower is a more complex social celebration requiring multiple planning steps.","context":["How to Plan A Baby Shower\nGetting ready to host a baby shower or gender reveal party? Need some help? We've got everything right here to help you get organized: checklists and guest lists ready to print out, even a gift tracking form to help with those very important after-shower thank-you notes and ideas for party entertainment for all ages.\nGetting Started Planning a Baby Party\nOur first bit of baby shower planning advice? Set aside four weeks for getting organized, planning, sending invitations, and purchasing the babyshower party supplies, decorations and favors.\nBack in my pregnancy days, showers were thrown by friends, not relatives ... and men were never invited to partake in the festivities! It's the 21st century and times have changed - many parents-to-be, family members and friends are throwing baby showers, and everyone's invited - sometimes even children!\nBaby parties are a celebration of life and family, and in fact, these days it's not uncommon to have more than one party, especially if the parents-to-be have a large family or several close friends, or if they have friends and family in widely separated spaces that make travel hard or expensive for a large number of guests.\nFunny Baby Shower Games\n4 Week Shower Planning Guide\nTo help you make sure you host the best baby shower ever, we've put together a four-week baby shower planning guide with steps to take for each week up to the big day of the baby shower.\nHere's how your work plan will break down over the 4 weeks leading up to the day of the party:\n- Week 1: Organizing the Shower or Gender Reveal Party\n- Weeks 2 & 3: Invitations and Entertainment Planning\n- Week 4: Final Details, Decorating, Shopping\n- Day Of the Shower: Time to Celebrate!\nWeek 1: Organizing A Baby Shower / Gender Reveal Party\nYou're throwing a baby party! How exciting. There are several decisions you'll need to make in the early stages of planning, so we'll walk you through each one and provide a ton of tips and hints to help out. To get started, here is a sample schedule you can use for your baby party bash:\nOf course you can throw in some more games, mix things up, leave things out, it's all up to you!\nPutting Together the Baby Shower Guest List\nWhen our parents were young, the hostess would invite only women to a baby shower: ladies from both sides of the family, the mom-to-be's girlfriends, and of course, the mom-to-be. Times have changed however, and potential invitees could be the dad-to-be, grandpa-to-be, uncles and anyone else!\nThe first decision you need to make is what kind of baby shower do you want to host? Do you want to invite women only? Will the parents-to-be have another baby shower for family members only? If so, you might consider hosting a friends-only baby shower. Another popular trend is to host a co-ed couples baby shower. And another trend is to hold a baby shower for co-workers of the mom- or dad-to-be (whichever one works at the same office as you).\nKids or No Kids?\nWhether or not to invite children is another decision you need to make right up front. If the baby-to-be already has a brother or sister, then inviting other kids would be a great way to get them involved in celebrating their new sibling.\nDepending on how old the older children are, they might be able to lead other kids in activities designed just for youngsters. Seven years old is about the right age child to invite to a baby shower. They'll feel as though they are included in hosting responsibilities and are part of the big event - which they are. For younger kids, or if the situation doesn't present opportunities for inviting children to a baby shower, you might consider hiring a babysitter to entertain the kids during the event.\nPicking a Baby Shower Location\nOnce you make a guest list and have a general idea of the number of guests, start researching local venues for the party.\nTraditionally, baby showers were held in the home of the hostess, but more recently restaurants and social halls have become popular places to throw a baby shower. Consider a restaurant or church social hall, a park picnic pavilion, a reception hall, or even a day at the spa with a catered lunch.\nWeeks 2 & 3: Shower Invitations & Entertainment\nAfter the guest list is set and you know where you're going to host the baby shower, it's time to pick a baby shower theme and send the invitations out!\nBaby Shower Themes\nBaby shower themes serve as inspiration for decorations and games, invitations, favors and even the food. Themes can be as simple as choosing a color scheme like blue and white if you know the parents-to-be are having a boy, or pink and white for a girl. A theme makes shopping for supplies a breeze!\nClick the link to see one of a selection of favorite party kits with Unique Baby Shower Themes. There are many different baby shower theme ideas to help get you started.\nFor example, if you are using a Rubber Duckies theme, select baby shower invitations with ducks, then buy cute duck decorations, a baby bath centerpiece filled with water and floating rubber ducks, small rubber duck favors, and yellow foods.\nSee how much fun baby shower themes can be?\nLet's Play Some Games\nBaby Shower party games are best when you have a group of people who may not know each other very well and you need to relax everyone before the party gets going.\nIce-breaker games set the mood for your shower and get people talking and laughing - this is a happy and fun occasion, so the more laughter, the better. If you're planning a theme baby shower, the party games can relate to the theme. Plan and choose about 3 games for a 2-hour shower.\nBaby Shower Invitations\nOnce you have the guest list settled and have all the address information, you're ready to mail the invitations. You need to allow your guests plenty of time to plan their schedule and find just the right gift. Invitations are a guest's first clue as to the style and/or theme of the party.\nYou can design custom printed baby shower invitations, buy preprinted cards, or design and print your own invitations, name tags and favor cards.\nIt's easy to use make your own invites: pick a front cover image and enter the details then print the invitations out on 8 1/2\" x 11\" paper, fold the cards into quarters and send them to your guests! The benefit of making your own invitations is that you have unlimited printouts.\nIf you make a mistake on one, no problem, just print out another. If you discover you have last minute additions to your guest list, you can easily print additional baby shower invitations on demand.\nGift Ideas for Mom-to-Be, Big Sister, Big Brother, Dad\nGive a personalized, unique gift to every member of baby-to-be's family.\nMenu and Beverages\nStart thinking about what you are going to serve. You don't need to finalize everything as you make your initial food plan, but you do want to have an idea of what you want to serve to your guests besides cake, coffee and tea.\nNeed suggestions? Finger foods work great and if you arrange them in several areas around the room it will encourage guests to mingle. Use food to reinforce the party theme. If your guest of honor has a favorite color, or if the shower theme revolves around a color, choose foods with the same color.\nThe time of day can help you decide what to serve. For a mid-morning baby shower, you could serve coffee and tea with pastries. For an afternoon baby shower affair you can serve a light lunch with cake and punch for dessert, or go lighter with finger foods or mini-sandwiches. A party held later in the afternoon could include chips and dip or vegetables and hummus along with a sweet finishing tidbit.\nTime to Go Shopping!\nThere are two rounds of shopping for baby shower planning. First you need to select and pick up invitations (or card stock to print your own), party favors and decorations. You can also print your own party ware from printables or by using clip art and designing your own!\nIn the week before the actual baby shower date you'll need to shop for food and beverages.\nNeed ideas for baby shower favors? One of our favorites are tealights personalized with the date of the baby shower. These cute, brushed aluminum 24-hour tea lights can be personalized in black, gold or silver ink. Another fun idea is to give out personalized bud vases. Both of these items make great keepsakes without breaking the bank.\nYou should also pick up a few items to use as prizes for the winners of your Baby Shower games - picture frames, compact mirrors, candles, journal notebooks or small jewelry boxes work well as prizes.\nWeek 4: Final Shower Details\nAfter 3 weeks of planning and organizing, shopping and preparing the favors, the last week means there are just a few days left until the big day.\nFinalize Menu and Go Shopping\nIn the final week before the shower you should finalize your menu plan for what you are going to serve at the baby shower. Write down all the ingredients, beverages, serving pieces and table ware you'll need, then take inventory on what you have on hand versus what you need to by for supplies. Need any extra film or decorations that may have been left out on the first round of shopping?\nConfirm Venue Reservations\nIf you have made reservations at a special venue for your baby shower party, call to re-confirm your reservation and also ensure they have enough chairs, tables and dishes. Also make sure you can get in early enough to set up the decorations and arrange the room how you want it for the shower.\nDay Of the Baby Shower - It's Time to Celebrate!\nThere are always a few loose ends to tie up on the day of the party, so the best thing to do is make a list and, yes, check it twice. Put a reminder to pick up flowers, balloons and last minute decorations on your day-of-the-event checklist.\n- Designate a photographer and/or videographer to capture the event for the parents-to-be and guests.\n- Take a photo of each guest with the parents-to-be as they leave the baby shower, and then get prints made so the parents can include a copy of the photo with each thank you note\n- Create a gift tracker and designate a gift recorder to write down gifts and givers so the mom-to-be will know who to send each thank you card to.\n- Provide a comfy chair, a small back pillow and footstool for the mother-to-be\n- Enlist a cleanup crew ahead of time so you don't get stuck with all the tidying up after the party's over\n- Bring along storage totes or boxes to organize the gifts and make them easier for the mom-to-be to transport them home. Designate a team to pack them up and deliver them or load them into the car after the shower.","Weddings, Baptisms, FUNERALS\nA Life Milestone\nBaptism is a symbolic action that signifies the new life God gives us as we join the church community.\nBaptism uses water as a symbolic cleansing that signifies the acceptance of new life within the church family. The sacrament of baptism is the single rite of initiation into the Christian community, the church.\nThe United Church offers baptism to all ages. We believe the gift of God's love doesn't depend on our ability to understand it, so we baptize people as infants right up through adulthood.\nWith children, instruction is given to parents or sponsors to equip them for the child's Christian nurture. During the ceremony, everyone in the congregation pledges support for the child and his or her parents.\nBaptism is not a requirement for God's love. We believe people who die without baptism are in no way condemned, lost, or damned.\nBaptism in the United Church is recognized by all denominations of the Christian church that practise infant baptism.

{"question":"What role do probability and superposition play in quantum mechanics and quantum computing, and how do these concepts bridge theoretical physics with practical applications?","answer":"In quantum mechanics, probability is fundamental to the wavefunction, where |ψ|2 represents the probability density of finding a particle at a specific location. The wavefunction must be normalized so that the probability of finding a particle somewhere in space equals one. In quantum computing, probability manifests through superposition, where qubits can be both 0 and 1 simultaneously, utilizing negative probabilities called amplitudes. These quantum mechanical phenomena enable quantum computers to potentially solve certain problems that classical computers cannot handle, though practical quantum computers don't exist yet. This theoretical framework has led to practical applications like quantum key distribution systems, which use quantum physics laws to prevent eavesdropping in secure communications.","context":["The wave-particle duality of matter is dealt with in quantum mechanics by considering that, rather than a particle traveling along a definite path, it is distributed through space like a wave. The classical idea of a trajectory is thus replaced in quantum mechanics by a wave, which is defined by a wavefunctionrepresented by ψ.\ni.e. the spatial distribution of a particle is represented by a wave, and the wavefunction is the mathematical function that describes this wave. The wavefunction contains all the information that would be available from the trajectory.\nFrom this, it follows that it must be possible to write a function that describes the complete state of a system (as it is possible to write a wavefunction for all the individual particles that make up the system). A function that completely describes a system is also called a wavefunction. (By “completely describes” we mean that the function contains information about all the properties of the system that may be experimentally determined, for example at the simplest level the position and momentum of particles.)\nIt is a fundamental principle in quantum mechanics that the wavefunction of a system contains all the information about measurable physical properties of the system.\nThe wavefunction is the function ψ described as “a function that precisely describes the system of interest ” in the section on principles of quantum mechanics on the previous page.\nIn general, a wavefunction is a function of the spatial coordinates of the particles that make up the system and of the time. If the way the system changes with time is not of interest, then this part of the wavefunction may usually be neglected. (It commonly proves possible to write the wavefunction as a product of a solely time-dependent part and a time-independent part.)\nThe wavefunction may also depend upon a property of the particles themselves known as their spin, but discussion of this will be left till later.\nAlthough, as we have said, it is theoretically possible to write a wavefunction for any system, the function rapidly becomes exceedingly complicated. It will thus normally be the case that a fully written out wavefunction will only be encountered for very simple systems.\nOne very important use of the wavefunction comes from the Born interpretation, which derives information about the location of a particle from its wavefunction.\nQuite simply, it states that the square modulus of the wavefunction, |Ψ|2 , at any given point is proportional to the probability of finding the particle at that point. (The quantity |ψ|2 is thus a probability density.)\nThis is simply illustrated in a 1-dimensional situation, when we can state that if the wavefunction of a particle has a value ψ at the point x, then the probability of finding the particle between x and x + dx is proportional to |ψ|2 dx . Thus the probability of finding the particle between two points a and b is proportional to the integral of the square modulus of the wavefunction, evaluated between limits of a and b:\nThe square modulus of a wavefunction (or indeed any function in general) is given by ψ ψ*, i.e. by the function multiplied by its complex conjugate. This means that |ψ|2 must always be real and positive.\nSince physical properties are directly related only to the square modulus of the wavefunction, it follows that we need not be concerned about the effect on these properties of the wavefunction being complex or negative at a particular point in space. (Note however that the sign of a wavefunction can indirectly be of great significance, as it gives rise to the possibilities of constructive or destructive overlap between different wavefunctions, which is for example crucial in theories of molecular bonding.)\nIt may be shown that if a wavefunction is an accurate description of a system, then it can be multiplied by any constant factor and still remain an accurate wavefunction for the system. i.e. if Ψ is a wavefunction, then so is NΨ, where N is a constant.\n(This is because any wavefunction must satisfy a particular equation known as the Schrodinger equation. The wavefunction occurs on both sides of the equation, so any constant factor may be cancelled. This is covered in more detail under a discussion of the Schrodinger equation, here.)\nThis allows us to find a constant factor, N, called a normalisation constant, that makes the constant of proportionality in the Born interpretation of the wavefunction equal to one. i.e. it makes the proportionality into an equality.\nNow, for a wavefunction NΨ, the probability of finding the particle anywhere in space is proportional to the integral of the square modulus of the wavefunction, N2|Ψ|2 , over all space. However, we also know that the probability of finding the particle somewhere in space must be equal to one (it is certain the particle must be somewhere in space), so we may write:\nEvaluation of the integral allows us to calculate the constant N required to normalise the wavefunction. Note that the integral is over all the space that the electron may occupy, eg from + ∞ to -∞ .\nFrom here on, unless otherwise specified, it should be assumed that the wavefunctions used are normalised. i.e. ψ includes a numerical factor that means in one dimension:\nIn three dimensions, the requirement for a wavefunction to be normalised is:\nwhere dτ is shorthand for dxdydz.","This is a summary of the talk “Quantum Computers vs. Computers Security”, given at the DEF CON 23 Hacking Conference in Las Vegas in August 2015 by Kudelski Security Principal Cryptographer, Jean-Philippe Aumasson.\nIncreasing numbers of cybersecurity experts and stakeholders are watching developments closely in the field of quantum computing. A quantum computer is a model of a computer that works completely differently from a classical one. It’s based on phenomena of quantum mechanics that facilitate the resolution of certain problems that classical computers cannot solve, e.g. breaking the crypto used for e-commerce transactions. How does a quantum computer work? Although it leverages complex quantum mechanical phenomena, the core concepts are pretty simple:\n- Whereas a classical computer works on bits that are either 0 or 1, a quantum computer works on qubits, which can be 0 and 1 simultaneously. In quantum physics, this is called superposition.\n- Superposition is characterized by some probabilities, but not the usual ones: a quantum computer relies on negative probabilities, which are called amplitudes.\n- The actual computation is not performed with usual computer operations such as addition or bitwise logic, but uses basic linear algebra transformations, similar to operations between vectors and matrices like in high school physics.\nThe good (or bad) news is that quantum computers don’t exist yet. Building a quantum computer is a gigantic and fascinating engineering challenge, and we don’t know for sure if it’s even doable. There’s been some progress over the last decade, and some large companies are investing in quantum computing research – but don’t expect a useful quantum computer within the next decade! Cryptographers obviously pay special attention to quantum computing research. A large enough quantum computer could totally break the RSA and Diffie-Hellman cryptographic algorithms, and more generally, all cryptography based on the mathematical problems of factoring integers (such as RSA) and of solving discrete logarithms (such as Diffie-Hellman and elliptic curve cryptography). In short, if a quantum computer is created today, we’re doomed! But there’s hope: the field of post-quantum cryptography is about creating cryptographic systems that can resist quantum computers. These experimental systems are based on different mathematical problems that are expected to be hard for both classical and quantum computers to solve. One such family of hard problems is that of NP-complete problems, which occurs in many contexts. For example, the problem of finding the optimal scheduling of a group of events is NP-complete. And quantum computers cannot solve NP-complete problems. Quantum physics has more potential applications to cybersecurity than of just breaking crypto:\n- Quantum key distribution establishes a secure link between two systems, leveraging quantum physics laws to prevent eavesdropping. Such systems are practical and are being deployed, though their actual added value in terms of security is sometimes disputed.\n- Quantum money uses the physical “no-cloning” principle to prevent counterfeiting. Quantum money is only a theoretical idea, and seems difficult to put in practice.\n- Quantum machine learning is an emerging field that attempts to leverage quantum computers to improve the efficiency of machine learning algorithms."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1f396825-d268-443f-966d-10af262778da>","<urn:uuid:032ff763-3a89-4778-b161-4c41b62c5f7e>"],"error":null}

{"question":"How does milk production and utilization differ between sheep dairy farms and other dairy operations?","answer":"Sheep dairy operations differ significantly from typical dairy farms. Sheep are milked seasonally from March through July, coinciding with spring lambing, with ewes producing about four and a half pounds of milk per day. The milking process is unique because sheep have only two teats compared to cows' four teats, allowing farmers to split each bucket milker between two ewes. In terms of milk utilization, sheep's milk is primarily used for cheese production due to its high fat content of 6 grams per 100 grams of milk, while cow's and goat's milk, which have similar and lower fat percentages, are more versatile in their uses and can be consumed directly.","context":["Timing and circumstance led Kristyn and Kevin Henslee to pursue what many may find a most unusual farm business. Three years ago, the Henlees started Yellow House Cheese, a sheep dairy and artisan cheese business in Seville, Ohio.\nThe Henslees operate one of just two sheep dairies in Ohio, and they are part of just 100 sheep dairies across the United States. And although they may be a minority here in the U.S., the Henslees note that milking sheep is a common practice in Europe.\nThe most commonly recognized cheeses made from sheep’s milk include feta of Greece, Roquefort of France, Manchego of Spain and Pecorino Romano, Pecorino Sardo and Ricotta of Italy.\nKristyn and Kevin Henslee met as 4-H members in Medina County, but neither had experience in the dairy industry.\n“I grew up showing beef steers and Kevin showed turkeys,” Kristyn said.\nWhile Kevin is a sixth grade teacher in the Medina School System, Kristyn longed for something that she could do at home while raising two young daughters, Corinne, 10 and Ellen, nine.\n“We knew that we wanted to be involved in agriculture,” she said. “We only have four acres here, so we knew it had to be something we could do on small acreage. We had always raised our own garden and beef, so we didn’t think it was ridiculous to milk sheep.”\nKristyn read a news release announcing a sheep dairy conference at the Ohio State University’s Agricultural Technical Institute in Wooster.\n“Kevin’s best friend was a chef out in Las Vegas, and we ran the idea by him,” she said. “He told us the restaurants out there were importing sheep’s milk cheese for $75 a pound. Then we learned that the United States imports 70 million pounds of sheep’s milk cheese each year and produces just one million pounds of it. We thought we might be on to something.”\nAfter attending the Wooster conference, Kristyn also participated in a class at the University of Wisconsin’s Spooner Agricultural Research Station, which operates a sheep dairy. The Henslees purchased 30 lambs from Wisconsin and later purchased rams to supplement their flock.\n“Our flock is a mix of Fresian, Lacaune, Dorset, South African Meat Merino and Hampshire breeds,” Kristyn said. “We are working to move our ewes up to 70% dairy genetics for optimal dairy production as well as trying to keep some meat qualities to market our spring lambs. There are a limited amount of bloodlines available in the U.S. for milk production — it’s not the American style of lamb that people are used to seeing.”\nThe Henslees milk their ewes seasonally from March through July, coinciding with the spring lambing season. Currently, lambs are weaned at 30 days, although the Henslees have weaned lambs at 36 hours and placed them on milk replacer in the past.\n“Thirty percent of the ewe’s milk production is in the first 30 days after lambing, so it’s a trade off,” Kristyn said.\nThe family is currently milking 44 ewes twice a day producing about four and a half pounds of milk each per day. The milking process takes about 45 minutes.\nA custom-designed raised milking parlor accommodates eight ewes at one time, which allows the Henslees to use two bucket milkers with split pulsation to gently milk the ewes.\n“Since ewes have only two teats and cows have four, we are able to split each bucket milker between two ewes,” Kevin said.\nThe milking process takes about two minutes per ewe.\nThe milking routine had a tough start in the beginning.\n“Those first three days it was pretty rough,” Kevin admits. “We didn’t know what we were doing and neither did the sheep. But we got there.”\nThe Henslees found that much like dairy cows, the sheep soon learned the routine and seem to look forward to milking.\n“You have to have a leader in the group, though,” Kristyn said. “When they are going in to be milked, if you have a timid leader, the sheep don’t go up to the parlor as easily.”\nAfter collecting the milk, Kristyn makes cheese about every three days. Every drop of sheep’s milk goes into the cheese-making process.\n“We get a lot of calls asking if we sell sheep’s milk, and we don’t,” she said. “We use it all in making cheese.”\nSheep’s milk contains a much higher fat content than cow’s milk. While cow’s milk may have 3.9 grams of fat per 100 grams of milk, sheep’s milk may average 6 grams of fat per 100 grams of milk.\n“You wouldn’t want to drink it,” she said.\nKristyn learned to make cheese while taking two courses with Three Shepherds of Mad River Valley, located in Vermont.\n“To me, it was going to be like baking a cake,” she said. “You have a recipe and you put the ingredients together and follow the directions. But there are a lot of variables, and you have to wait 90 days to see if it turned out.”\nTo make the cheese, Kristyn combines the ingredients into a large vat in her creamery, then places the cheese into molds where they remain for two days. Then the molds go to the “cheese cave” where they cure for 75 to 90 days.\n“We keep the cheese cave at 50 degrees and try to maintain 95% humidity to help the cheese age,” Kevin said.\nThe couple converted an existing root cellar on their farm, which they dug out and renovated with an extensive ventilation system.\n“In the summer it’s a challenge to maintain the humidity, so we wet the floor and we have misters also,” he said.\nEarly in their business plan, the Henslees decided to concentrate on making artisan blue cheese.\n“Mainly we chose blue cheese because no one else in Ohio was doing it,” Kristyn said. “It was a lot of trial and error, because we didn’t want it to taste like anyone else’s. We wanted it to taste like cheese with a blue flavor, not have a moldy taste.”\nYellow House Blue is the dairy’s signature blue cheese offering. In its first year to compete in 2013, Yellow House Blue won second place in the American Cheese Society’s annual cheese competition in the Sheep’s Milk Blue Mold Cheeses category. Yellow House Blue is described as “a sophisticated taste, firm with sharp, salty, blue flavor bite with a complex set of flavors.”\nYellow House Cheese also produces a fresh cow’s milk cheese, Wooster Pike Blue. As the Henslees perfected their cheeses, they began to sell at farmer’s markets.\n“We go to markets at the North Union markets at Shaker Square and Chagrin Falls, the Cuyahoga Valley Conservancy District Market and the Medina Farmer’s Market,” Kevin said.\n“We were brand new and we had no reputation,” added Kristyn. “We were aiming to be consistent, and make sure we had a product that people wanted. What we found was that many of the chefs would come by the markets and buy local ingredients. They really started coming to us by word of mouth before we were even ready to approach them.”\nThe Henslees also found themselves launching in the midst of the local food movement.\n“Everyone is thinking about locally grown products, and our cheeses fit right into that,” Kristyn said. “We work really hard to educate our customers at the markets about how our cheeses are made, and we find the restaurant staffs share our story with their customers too.”\nBecause it takes 90 days from start to cured cheese, the Henslees are still seeking to find balance between supply and demand.\n“We don’t make cheese just to make cheese,” Kristyn said. “I have a home for almost every wheel of cheese in the cheese cave right now. So when someone new calls to buy cheese, we’re looking at 90 days to get it to them.”\nThe Henslees also see growth in their value-added products. They sell lambs, lamb meat and wool, as well as sell their whey products to local farms.\n“We’ve worked really hard to put up a high quality product,” said Kevin. “We work really hard at doing the right thing.”\nLearn more about Yellow House Cheese by visiting their website at www.yellowhousecheese.com.","Composition of Cow, Sheep and Goat Milks\nTable 1: Chemical Composition of Milk from different species.\n|Total Solid %||12.2||12.0||16.3|\nTable 2: Principle fatty acids (g/100g fat) in milk fats from different species.\nNote: The tabled figures above are averages obtained through scientific studies. Milk composition varies according to feed, breeds of animal, stages of lactation and the environment.\nAll of the products produced at Meredith Dairy are made using pasteurisation.\nCow’s milk and Goat milk have a similar percentage of fat and protein in the milk (see Table 1.). However the differences in the size and composition of the fat molecules in the milk between the two species attribute to easier digestion of goat milk.\nWhen compared to cow’s milk, the fat globules contained in goat milk are much smaller in size. As a result of this there is an increase in the surface area of the fats which are exposed to lipase enzymes within the intestines which allows a more efficient break down (digestion) of these molecules.\nIn addition to this, there are a greater proportion of medium chain fatty acids in goat milk fat when compared to cow’s milk (see Table 2.). The smaller chain size allows the lipase enzymes to process these compounds more quickly.\nSome goat milk products have a strong and sometimes offensive flavour. This flavour is due to the presence of medium-chain fatty acids (capric, caprylic and dcaproic acid) combined with bacterial enzymes (lipase) which breakdown these molecules to produce the “goaty” flavour. Matured goat cheese products typically present this flavour attribute, however fresh goat cheese such as the products manufactured at Meredith Dairy (Chevre, Marinated Cheese) should be absent of this flavour. Fresh, correctly treated goat milk usually has a very neutral and clean flavour.\nFood Allergies and Intolerance\nBelow is an excerpt taken from the Victorian Government website: Better Health Channel, if you would like further information please follow the link provided and consult your local health professional when seeking medical advice.\nAllergy is an immune response\nAllergies are an overreaction of the body’s immune system to a specific part of a food, usually a protein. These proteins may be from foods, pollens, house dust, animal hair or moulds. They are called allergens. The word ‘allergy’ means that the immune system has responded to a harmless substance as if it were toxic.\nFood intolerance is a chemical reaction\nFood intolerance is a ‘chemical’ reaction that some people have after eating or drinking some foods; it is not an immune response. Food intolerance has been associated with asthma, chronic fatigue syndrome and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Food intolerance is much more common than food allergy.\nMilk Allergies and Intolerance\nGoat’s milk protein has a similar structure to that of cow’s milk thus goat milk is not suitable for those people with a true cow’s milk allergy (IgE-mediated immune response). Intolerances to cow’s milk based dairy products may be overcome by switching to goat or sheep based products however this will vary from person to person.\nIf you are unsure whether you are intolerant or allergic to milk products it is best to seek advice from your doctor or health professional before trying new foods.\nPregnancy & Our Cheese\nThe issue with pregnancy and cheese is the potential harm to the baby & mother caused by food contaminated with a bacteria called “Listeria Monocytogenes (LM) referred to as Listeriosis. You should make yourself familiar with this bacteria and foods which can become contaminated with LM.\nThere are several strains of Listeria but only the Monocytogenes strain is harmful to health. LM, mostly referred to as just Listeria, has been found in small goods, including smoked fish, dips, salads, as well as soft cheese. There are incidents of LM in both unpasteurised and pasteurised cheeses as the bacteria can be present not only in the unpasteurised milk but in the factory environment. By law any food containing this bacteria must be removed from circulation.\nAll of the cheeses we make at Meredith are pasteurised, eliminating the presence of this bacteria in the milk for cheese making, but contamination after pasteurisation is a risk and has occurred at other cheese factories.\nAt Meredith Dairy, we test our cheeses and the factory environment for LM. To date we have not had any laboratory tests indicating the presence of LM in our factory environment or cheeses. This is reassuring for our company, but this bacteria is commonly found in the environment, in soil, wet areas & in animal feed.\nPregnancy is a very special time and the choice to eat processed foods including cheese is a personal one, perhaps avoiding processed foods whilst pregnant is a small price to pay.\nLactose, literally meaning “milk sugar”, is the primary sugar found in milk from most mammals. Those who have a sensitivity or intolerance toward lactose lack the ability to produce the enzyme (lactase) that is required for the break down and digestion of lactose in the human body.\nFermented dairy products, such as yoghurt and cheese, are manufactured using starter cultures (good bacteria) whose primary role is to convert the lactose present in the milk into lactic acid which forms an integral part of the finished product.\nDepending on their sensitivity, lactose intolerant people can better tolerate fermented dairy products due to the action of the starter cultures consuming the lactose in the milk. All products manufactured at Meredith Dairy are considered high-acid thus a high portion of lactose in the product has consumed by the starter cultures making the products more favourable for those lactose sensitive people who enjoy dairy products.\nContent on this website is provided for education and information purposes only.

I have not found any scientific based evidence to confirm that the canola we use is bad. There are references indicating that heating can change the chemical structure of cooking oils, but we use only cold-pressed oil, and don’t use any heating or cooking to make the marinade. Furthermore, cold pressing excludes the use of chemical oil extraction.\nThe cold-pressed canola we use is GMO free, grown in Australia, has a neutral taste, is free of taints and trans fats. Canola grown in the Northern Hemisphere often is GMO, not so in Australia. Australian farmers who grow GM canola, are listed on a register. We use only GMO free oils. Click here for more info.\nWe use blended Australian edible oils, Extra Virgin olive Oil (EVOO) & GMO free Canola.\n- Our product tastes better with this blend.\n- The Australian EVOO has a very robust flavour. The unblended Extra Virgin Olive oil overpowers the other flavours in the marinade.\n- Aust grown olives contain high levels of wax and when cold pressed, the wax is retained in the olive oil. At refrigeration temps the EVOO wax solidifies and looks unsightly.\n- The olive oil characteristics can vary due to seasonal conditions. A blended product helps maintain the colour, flavour and texture of the marinade.\n- Australian Canola oil is lower in saturated fat than any other oil, is second only to olive oil with levels of monounsaturated fats. It contains Omega-3 fatty acids which lowers levels of cholesterol and triglycerides. (Omega-3 is known to contribute to heart health, brain growth and development)\n- We use only cold pressed oils. The edible oils are erucic acid free.\n- After extensive sensory analysis we wanted a marinade with a neutral taste, good colour, light, smooth taste, free of cholesterol and Trans fats.\n- We use only GMO free edible oil, grown in Australia.\nUnfortunately there has been a lot of misrepresentations and generalisations made regarding plastics and their potential to migrate into our foods.\nThere is some truth in these claims, however these occurrences are only specific to certain types of plastics under certain conditions. The classic case where this issue can occur is with the use of cling film with the offender being the PVC (polyvinylchloride) component.\nWhen this product is in contact with fatty foods (e.g. meat and cheese) and is subject to a heat process such as a microwave this is where the migration can occur. This same issue can be applied to those plastic containers that are not deemed microwave safe.

{"question":"Could you help compare how exchange rates are determined through supply-demand versus parity conditions? I'm studying international finance.","answer":"Exchange rates are determined differently under these two approaches. In the supply-demand framework, the exchange rate is determined by market forces where participants like international banks and multinational companies create demand and supply for currencies. The equilibrium rate changes when factors like inflation, growth rates, and interest rates affect these conditions. In contrast, parity conditions focus on establishing equilibrium relationships - particularly through Purchasing Power Parity (PPP), which links exchange rates to relative inflation rates between countries. PPP states that currencies of high-inflation countries will depreciate by approximately the difference in inflation rates. While the supply-demand model works continuously, PPP is more accurate in the long-run and acts more like a band than a precise line due to market imperfections.","context":["How to Determine Exchange Rates through Supply and Demand\nThe demand–supply framework enables you to predict the next period’s exchange rate. When you understand this framework, you’ll be able to predict the direction of the change in the exchange rate — in other words, whether a currency will depreciate or appreciate against another currency. Keep the following in mind when applying the demand–supply model to exchange rates:\nAn exchange rate implies the relative price of a currency. For example, the euro–dollar exchange rate tells you how many euros to give up to buy one dollar. Therefore, this exchange rate implies the price of a dollar in euros.\nIf the exchange rate is expressed as the dollar–euro rate, it tells you how many dollars to give up to buy one euro. Therefore, this exchange rate implies the price of a euro in dollars.\nCertain forces affect the demand for and supply of dollars, or of any other currency, in foreign exchange markets.\nThe demand–supply model of exchange rate determination implies that the equilibrium exchange rate changes when the factors that affect the demand and supply conditions change.\nThis example uses the market for dollars as an example, but you can use any market you want. Whichever market you use, be careful when labeling the x- and y-axes of your model. For example, if you have the quantity of oranges on the x-axis, you have to put the price of oranges on the y-axis. Then the supply and demand curves inside the model refer to oranges.\nAlso, think about the meaning of the demand for and supply of dollars. Who are these people that want to buy or sell dollars or any other currency? They are international banks, multinational companies, speculators, and so on. Whenever they want to buy dollars, they’ll be along the demand curve. Whenever they want to sell dollars, they’ll be along the supply curve.\nPrice and quantity of the dollar market\nIf you want to graph the dollar market, the quantity on the x-axis must be the quantity of dollars in the market. Therefore, the price indicated by the y-axis must be the price of dollars in another currency (in this example, the euro). In other words, the exchange rate has to be defined as the euro–dollar exchange rate.\nConsequently, the demand and supply curves indicate the demand for and supply of dollars. The figure shows the initial equilibrium exchange rate as 0.89 per dollar.\nEven though this example talks about the demand and supply of dollars, don’t think about the domestic money demand and supply. For now, think about foreign exchange markets where market participants buy or sell currencies.\nFactors that affect demand and supply\nCeteris paribus conditions are associated with the demand and supply of dollars. These conditions are related to the macroeconomic fundamentals of two countries represented in the exchange rate.\nBecause the example exchange rate is the euro–dollar rate, the following variables may change in the U.S. or the Euro-zone, which then have an effect on the euro–dollar exchange rate:\nIn the demand–supply model, these factors are divided into two areas based on how they affect exchange rates. Inflation rate and growth rate are considered trade-related factors. When you apply the changes in one of these factors to exchange rates, you think about the trade between the U.S. and the Euro-zone.\nThe interest rate, on the other hand, is a portfolio flow–related factor. It means that when one of the country’s interest rate changes, you think about how this change affects the attractiveness of dollar- and euro-denominated securities to American and European investors.\nGovernment restrictions can be related to both trade flows and portfolio flows, depending on the nature of these restrictions.\nNote that the changes in inflation, growth, and interest rates, as well as government restrictions, don’t have to be actual changes that you are observing right now. If market participants have expectations regarding these changes, they will act on them now, producing the same results as if these changes were actually happening.","Parity Conditions - Lecture 4\nHelp to determine if foreign exchange rates are predictable.\neliminate risk doing business abroad\nBy parity there means there is some sort of equilibrium or equality.\n4 Variables - Outline the Parity Condition\n*Note: If parity conditions are to hold (equality) we must assume that exchange rates are fully floating and there are no capital controls\n5 Parity Conditions:\nPurchasing Power Parity\nRelationship btw inflation and exchange rates\nInflation and Nominal Interest Rates\nInternational Fisher Effect\nNominal interest rates and Exchange rates\nInterest Rate Parity\nRelates nominal interest rates to the forward premium or discount on the currency Forward Rate\nPredictor of the spot rate\nPurchasing Power Parity (PPP):\nLaw of 1 Price\nIdentical goods in two different markets with no restrictions on sale or transportation costs of moving the product btw the two markets that the product prices should be the same Conversion to the foreign currency\nP$ X S = P(Euros)\nS = spot exchange rate\nSpot rate = P(Euros)/P$\nNot workable because we are talking about specific products.

The expected change in exchange rate is -4%. In other words, the US dollar will depreciate by 4%. Why does this make sense?\nUS goods are more expensive, the demand for the $ decreases, therefore the value of dollar decreases\n**PPP states - Currencies on high inflation countries will depreciate by approximately the difference in inflation rate and vice - versa\nWe are looking at the rate of change for this equation:\ndS/S = [dPI(country1)/PI(country1)] - [dPI$/PI$]\nRate of the change of the spot rate compared to the rate of change in the inflation in both and foreign countries\nUsing derivatives to indicate we are talking about a rate of change\nPPP: Does it work?\nOver time (LR) - yes, gives us relatively accurate predictions of exchange rates SR - no\nPPP is more of a band then a line - there is some margin for error due to the differences in price indices\nPPP line demonstrates there is an inverse relationship: If the difference in the relationship is positive (foreign inflation is greater than home inflation) the home currency will appreciate.

{"question":"What are the key differences between protecting against external cyber threats and implementing an Information Security Management System (ISMS)?","answer":"While protecting against external cyber threats focuses on specific measures like preventing spyware, hacks, and phishing scams, an ISMS takes a more comprehensive approach. External threat protection primarily deals with preventing attacks and fraud, but an ISMS is a systematic approach that manages sensitive company information by including people, processes, and IT systems through risk management. The ISMS framework covers not just security measures but also ensures legal compliance, handles internal vulnerabilities, and addresses future security needs. It can be implemented in any size organization within any industry and provides a structured approach to maintaining information security across all aspects of the business.","context":["Any non-profit organization established business or start-up enterprise that does not take cybersecurity seriously in the information age is storing up trouble for itself. There are potentially business-critical outcomes that can occur in short order when cybersecurity is not sufficiently prioritized within a business. And yet, most businesses do not have the technical know-how to protect themselves fully. All of the necessary steps can be put in place, of course, with the right sort of outsourced expertise but what decision-makers need to take on board is that cybersecurity ought to be a top commercial priority along with sales and marketing and employee retention. Why is it so crucial?\nProtect Your Enterprise From Attack\nIt is not just government departments around the globe that come under attack from cyber warfare or online criminal activity. At any passing moment, a stealthy piece of spyware could be monitoring your financial transactions ready to commit fraud. There again, you might be subject to a hack that leads to data loss prevention or even a ransom being demanded. Other forms of cyber threat include phishing scams and even the theft of intellectual property. Any of these types of attacks could put your company out of business or, at least, severely hamper it, so proactive measures ought to be put in place sooner rather than later. This is why many companies and organizations hire professional cybersecurity providers.\nEnsure Data Breaches Do Not Occur\nAs mentioned, data breaches can occur from malign attacks but this is not the only way they happen. Sometimes, simple user errors or negligence leads to private data classification falling into the wrong hands, for instance. You might even find your network is susceptible to a device being plugged in directly and lifting your data without even needing to bypass your firewall. As such, cybersecurity is as much about adjusting your company’s practices to make it more secure as it is about avoiding external threats.\nAvoid Regulatory Failings\nThere are all sorts of regulations that companies of any size need to comply with if they are to handle and store data. This means any sort of record-keeping under most codes, not just sensitive data, such as payment information. In the EU, GDPR rules are fairly well-known nowadays but they are far from the only regulatory code across the world. Operating online may mean you need to work within multiple foreign regulatory frameworks as well as your local one. Bear in mind that failures can lead to big fines being levied against offending companies.\nAdopt an Information Security Management System That’s Fit For Purpose\nUltimately, understanding cybersecurity properly is not about taking a few discrete measures, such as setting a new password on your firm’s router or running anti-malware software, important though these measures are. In the end, it comes down to operating in a systematic manner that covers all aspects of cybersecurity. This is why organizations that take it seriously will usually implement a thorough information security management system (ISMS) that deals with their current vulnerabilities while also addressing their future security needs.\nInteresting Related Article: “Cybersecurity Market Predictions: What to Expect in the Next 5 Years?“","What is ISO 27001?\nThe ISO 27001:2013 (also known as BS EN 27001:2017) standard provides a framework for an Information Security Management Systems (ISMS) that enables the continued confidentiality, integrity and availability of information as well as legal compliance.

It includes people, processes and IT systems by applying a risk management process.\nIt can help any size organization within any industry keep business information assets secure.\nGDPR and ISO 27001\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has a much more extensive scope than the previous Data Protection Act (DPA) and has been introduced to stay in touch with the modern digital landscape. The Regulation affords more data rights to individuals and requires organizations to develop defined policies, procedures and to adopt relevant technical and organizational controls to protect personal data.\nThe GDPR applies to two types of users, of which we will undoubtedly all fall; Controllers and Processors. Briefly put; the controller determines how and why the personal data is used or processed and the processor acts on the controllers behalf, much like many organizations relying on the services of an IT service provider. Processors have more legal obligations placed on them in the case of a breach however a controller will be responsible for ensuring the contracts with the processor comply with the GDPR.\nThis is not a complete overview of the regulation and should not be used as such.
