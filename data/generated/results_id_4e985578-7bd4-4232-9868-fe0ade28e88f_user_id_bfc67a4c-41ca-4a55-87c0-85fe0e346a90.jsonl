{"question":"How do the acting methods of Stanislavski and Grotowski compare in their approach to emotion and memory? Could you provide a detailed analysis of their similarities and differences in handling these psychological aspects of performance?","answer":"Both Stanislavski and Grotowski incorporated emotion and memory in their acting techniques, but with different emphases. Stanislavski's system focused on using personal emotion memory and experiences to develop characters, allowing actors to apply their own life experiences for proper portrayal. Grotowski, while also using emotion memory like Stanislavski, demanded total honesty and authenticity from actors about their memories, believing that only genuine memories would lead to self-discovery. He combined this psychological approach with intense physical and vocal training, believing that bodies express everything we think and feel. Both practitioners aimed for authentic performances, but Grotowski's approach was more physically intensive and focused on stripping away theatrical artifice through his 'Poor Theatre' concept.","context":["Just as any other profession in this world, acting requires training and application of various techniques if you want to reach the stars. You might have heard of Stanislavski or Chekhov, but not realise what these people actually did for the film industry. In this article, you will learn about five basic acting techniques and get a couple more tips on how to prepare for your next big role.\nStanislavski’s system is a universal acting technique that is based on the theories and philosophies created and developed by Constantin Stanislavski. Professors teaching Stanislavski’s method aim at developing concentration, physical skills, voice, emotion memory, observation, and dramatic analysis of their students. By learning a variety of these parts of a human existence you will be able to try a character, apply him or her to your own life and use your personal feelings and experiences for proper portrayal. The best idea of this technique was said by Stanislavski himself: “Create your own method. Don’t depend slavishly on mine. Make up something that will work for you! But keep breaking traditions, I beg you.”\nChekhov’s acting technique\nMichael Chekhov was Stanislavski’s student, but he looked at the portrayal of a character from a different perspective. He taught that an actor needs to focus on the character’s internal problem and then express this issue or struggle through movements. Clint Eastwood and Marilyn Monroe used Chekhov’s technique to live their characters’ lives. They would repeat movements and gestures of their characters to allow their physical memory build their performance on an unconscious level. Once the body remembers proper gestures, any improvisation will come naturally attached to the character.\nStrasberg’s acting technique\nLee Strasberg and the members of his Theater Group developed the technique that emphasized the importance of affective memory for an actor. They said that an actor needs to connect to a character through personal emotions and memories. All professors working with the Strasberg’s technique design exercises and workshops to develop students sense memory and affective memory. Actors working with Strasberg’s technique are referred to as “method actors”, they are Jake Gyllenhaal or Jared Leto.\nIf you would like to work within this framework, you will need to imagine yourself with the thoughts and emotions of your characters in order to develop lifelike performances.\nMeisner acting technique\nThis acting technique is related to the Strasberg’s one, but in this case, an actor focuses not on him- or herself, but completely the acting partner. And by focusing here and now on the partner, an actor gets into the state that the reality is only something that exists in this particular moment. Such technique is used frequently for intimate scenes that require a lot of authenticity. This method and especially exercises for its advancement help get closer to the partner and make the scenes more natural. These are Naomi Watts and Alec Baldwin that employ the Meisner technique.\nPractical aesthetics acting technique\nDavid Mamet and William H. Macy are the founders of this acting technique and it’s based on the Stanislavski’s and Meisner’s techniques as well as the philosophy of Epictetus. This technique is based on 4 step-analysis of the situation: 1. A literal description of a situation; 2. Explanation of what one actor wants the other one to do or to say; 3. Understanding of what the character is supposed to do and what the actor will be doing; 4. Implementation of the actor’s personal experience in the situation from point 3.\nThis method helps an actor go away from the fiction and make the whole scene more truthful. However, in this case, the scene will be based not only on the character’s life and experience but mostly on the actor him- or herself. Felicity Huffman and Clark Gregg are the examples of this technique in action.\nOf course, you understand clearly that all five techniques are essential for working over the role and are of great use in different scenes. What you will choose for a particular shooting day is up to you, however generally film investment companies like Red Rock Entertainment explain that they are more likely to sponsor a film with actors juggling all these techniques at once.\nBelow we also prepared several real-life tips that will help you get ready for the first day of the shooting.\nLearn your character\nBefore you can apply any of the above-mentioned techniques, you need to understand who your character is, what they like, what they hate, whom they love/like and dislike, what they wear, how they talk and move, etc. Think of your character as of an interesting person you need to know best of all. Once you know who you need to transform into, the process will go easier.\nOf course, be ready that not everything might be clear from the very beginning. For instance, you might not know what your character’s hobby is, or what’s their political position. In such cases, you have the right to complete them with your own ideas and experiences. However, make sure that you share your groundwork with the director and writers before implementing them into the life.\nGet into the skin of your character\nOnce you learn everything about your character, it’s time to start transition period. Speak in the way your character would, learn their accent, talk to people with the same accent, listen to the audio tracks to master the speech aspect. The same rule applies to the gestures: watch as many videos as possible, talk to the similar personas to get in the right direction.\nIf you can afford it, move to a place similar to the living conditions of your character. For instance, Robert de Niro moved to Sicilia when he was preparing for “The Godfather: Part II” or he studied the behaviour of the mentally ill people and worked as a taxi driver for a month while preparing for “Taxi Driver.” Adrien Brody sold all his home and car to experience the need, he started starving to feel the despair of not getting any food. Such tortures were needed to play an impeccable character of Władysław Szpilman in “The Pianist.” Both actors received the highest award possible for their efforts – the Oscars.\nStay in the character\nTo stay in character you need to use all the described above techniques of acting. But here’s a shortlist of essentials for you:\nWhen at the set, recollect some similar situation from your memory, remember your feelings and emotions at that moment and live it through again. Keep in mind that microexpressions do count, so think of a particular smell, taste, view, sights, as well as tactile feeling.\nInstead of recollecting your old memories try to apply your character’s problem or situation to your current love. So replace or substitute your partner with someone from your real life to make emotions feel more natural.\nThink of the gestures that would fit perfectly into the current scene and situation and use it in the most important moment. By doing so you will also make your whole body work following this little gesture and so making your acting more truthful.\nThe bottom line is to learn the theory and then apply in your profession. Without any doubts, by only reading this article you won’t learn the craft of acting, but you can become aware of the existing techniques to come prepared for workshops and classes. Learn, act, and transform – this is your motto for the career!","Jerzy Grotowski -Theatre Practioner - Acting Method\nJerzy Grotowski was one of the most important European theatre practitioners of the 20th Century.\nIf you are currently preparing for LAMDA Acting Grade 8 you will need to know and understand the key principles and influences in the process of acting for one of the following practitioners: Constantin Stanislavski, Bertolt Brecht or Jerzy Grotowski. Here we look at Jerzy Grotowski.\nJerzy Grotowski was a theatre director, educator and creator of acting methods. He was born in 1933 in Rzeszów in Poland and died in 1999 in Pontedera, Italy. He is considered to have been one of the great reformers of 20th century theatre.\nHe was known for his intense actor training in Poland in the 1960s and 1970s.\nJerzy Grotowski and his small groups of actors were known for experimenting with many different aspects of theatre: spiritualistic, ritualistic and physical and also the nature of role and the relationship between actor and spectator. His acting system is probably the most complete approach to role since Stanislavski.\nHe invented the term 'Poor Theatre': a style of performance that got rid of all extraneous parts of theatre. This meant there were no lavish costumes, complicated props or detailed sets.\nRelied on skill of actors and required only a few props.\nGrotowski enjoyed working in unconventional spaces. He liked the audience to be all around the performance area or in amongst the actors.\nHe used the physical skill of his performers rather than costumes and minimal props to become other significant objects; building on Brecht's thoughts and ideas on performance.\n- Main influences: Brecht, Stanislavsky and Meyerhold.\n- Focused on actor training and probably most intensive actor training since Stanislavsky\n- Poor Theatre gets rid of excesses of theatre\n- Opposite to commercial theatre - the complete antithesis of the star-led shows you often see in the West End\n- Grotowski believed theatre could never compete with television and film so it shouldn't attempt to\n- The majority of Poor Theatre works never made it to performance\n- The ones that did were performed only once to a very small audience\n- The word 'paratheatre' is often used in relation to Grotowski - 'para' meaning 'beyond'\n- With 'paratheatre' Grotowski experimented with actors in training programs and other non-performed pieces.\n- The 'paratheatrical' phrase is generally believed to be between 1969/70 and 1975/1976\n- The Poor Theatre phase was between 1959 and 1970\n- 1975 marked the end of all Grotowski performances\n- Grotowski often experimented with classical works\n- He often updated them for a modern audience\n- He changed the setting to make them more relevant\nSpace and Actor/Audience Relationship\n- Traditional theatre spaces were ignored in favour of small rooms and buildings\n- He didn't believe in a traditional stage dedicated to acting or a purpose built theatre for performances\n- Grotowski's work focused on the relationship between the actor and spectator\n- The aim of his work was to eliminate the divide between audience and actor and create a union between the two\n- The audience were often on all sides of the actors and performance space\n- The actors performed around the space and audiences, placing themselves strategically amongst them\n- The acting area was often bare with little set and few props\n- Object transformation was an important part of Poor Theatre - props becoming different things\n- After a prop was transformed it became incredibly significant/often symbolic\n- The lighting was often just a general wash of the stage, no specific spotlights or focused areas\n- If costumes were used at all they were not character specific, they were completely anonymous\nActing and Characterisation\n- The actor and his/her skill was at the core of all Poor Theatre performances\n- Sometimes no 'real' props were used at all and other actors were employed to play important objects\n- The actor training was incredibly intense and took place over long periods of time\n- Grotowski wanted the acting to be completely authentic, much like Stanislavsky, but more physical\n- He used a version of Stanislavsky's emotion memory technique with his students.\nGrowtowski's main theories, training and techniques\n- Acting through focus and awareness\n- His actors were so physically and vocally skilled they could communicate clearly through just sounds and movements.\n- The actors kept healthy mentally and physically aiming to have inner peace and focus\n- They believed that acting was a search for self knowledge and awareness\n- The training taught them to break free from limitations and reach their full potential\n- Working in silence\n- Grotowski said an actor must begin by doing nothing\n- He believed that if a group of actors could remain completely still for several minutes without distractions then they would be able to concentrate more intensely and use it as a 'creative passage'\n- Physical training\n- The actors were extremely physically skilled\n- They developed a technique of movement which allowed them to control every move they made, even the smallest detail.\n- Grotowski believed that our bodies expressed everything about us. Everything we think and feel is expressed through our bodies and everything we experience is felt in our bodies.\n- He gave actors the skills to be able to fully express their emotions and imaginations.\n- Voice training was essential\n- They focused their voices as if they were coming from different parts of their bodies.\n- Range was incredibly important - they used all parts of their register from the lowest point to the highest.\n- Grotowski believed in the important of clarity - he used poetry, singing and chanting to impress this.\n- All of the actors were incredibly vocally strong - they were able to imitate nature sounds, animals and even thunder.\n- Grotowski thought of the voice as an instrument and treated it as such.\n- Human contact\n- He believed in real contact between human beings\n- He believed that human relationships only developed when people really looked and listened to each other.\n- He wanted actors to be aware of the impact they had on other people.\n- 'Poor Theatre' used the simplest of sets, costumes, lighting and props. This meant actors had to use all their skills to completely transform a space into other imaginative worlds.\n- Symbolism was incredibly important\n- The most important element was the relationship between actors and the audience.\n- Like Brecht, Grotowski used emotion memory to recall and experience and recreate the feeling and emotion that went with that memory.\n- He wanted total honesty and truth from the actors about their memories - the more truthful the memory the more genuine and authentic the performance.\n- Only by using their genuine memories would the actors find themselves on the oath to self discovery.\n- Evoking silence\n- Grotowski stated the actor should begin by doing nothing - he called this creative passivity.\n- By experiencing external silence they would begin to learn internal silence.\n- They could then use this for intense creative concentration.\n- Grotowski warned his actors to avoid what he called 'the beautiful lie' both on stage and in their every day lives.\n- By this he meant they should avoid doing things on stage, and in real life, just because they look good or it was what people expected them to do.

{"question":"What are the key differences between Mary's chastity and Ibrahim's devotion as exemplary models of faith?","answer":"Mary and Ibrahim were both exemplary models of faith but demonstrated different virtuous qualities. Mary was declared one of the best women in history specifically for her chastity, love of worship, and patience in facing adversity including accusations of fornication. Ibrahim, on the other hand, was highlighted as a model for being devoutly obedient to Allah, true in faith, and notably refusing to join gods with Allah. He demonstrated his devotion through building the Kaaba, making duas (prayers) for future generations, and showing complete submission to Allah's commands even in difficult situations like leaving his wife and infant son in an uninhabited valley.","context":["THE DIVINE PARABLES 41 of 49 .\n(41) SEED GROWING [48:29] Muhammad (SAW) is the Messenger of Allah, and those who are with him are severe against disbelievers, and merciful among themselves. You see them bowing and falling down prostrate (in prayer), seeking Bounty from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure. The mark of them (i.e. of their Faith) is on their faces (foreheads) from the traces of (their) prostration (during prayers). This is their description in the Taurat (Torah). But their description in the Injeel (Gospel) is like a (sown) seed which sends forth its shoot, then makes it strong, it then becomes thick, and it stands straight on its stem, delighting the sowers that He may enrage the disbelievers with them. Allah has promised those among them who believe (i.e. all those who follow Islamic Monotheism, the religion of Prophet Muhammad SAW till the Day of Resurrection) and do righteous good deeds, forgiveness and a mighty reward (i.e. Paradise).\nMEANING: Allah confirming the Prophet hood of Muhammad (Peace of Allah upon him) & the sincerity of his companions. As the message grew delightfully & the Muslims became more & stronger, the disbelievers were unhappy with the growth, they tormented them, boycotted them & engaged them in wars in & out until Islam finally became victorious.\nTHE DIVINE PARABLES 42 of 49 .\n(42) RAIN AND PHYSICAL GROWTH [57:20] Know that the life of this world is only play and amusement, pomp and mutual boasting among you, and rivalry in respect of wealth and children, as the likeness of vegetation after rain, thereof the growth is pleasing to the tiller; afterwards it dries up and you see it turning yellow; then it becomes straw. But in the Hereafter (there is) a severe torment (for the disbelievers, evil-doers), and (there is) Forgiveness from Allah and (His) Good Pleasure (for the believers, good-doers), whereas the life of this world is only a deceiving enjoyment. 21. Race one with another in hastening towards Forgiveness from your Lord (Allah), and towards Paradise, the width whereof is as the width of heaven and earth, prepared for those who believe in Allah and His Messengers. That is the Grace of Allah which He bestows on whom He pleases. And Allah is the Owner of Great Bounty.\nMEANING: Allah reminds us that we are going to be alive for a short while on Earth therefore we should avoid distractions & remember we will have to meet God for judgement. We should do as many good deeds as possible before we die, so that we can enjoy ourselves in Paradise for Eternity, rather than face perpetual suffering in Hell.\nTHE DIVINE PARABLES 43 of 49 .\n MOUNTAIN THAT HUMBLES ITSELF [59:21] Had We sent down this Quran on a mountain, you would surely have seen it humbling itself and rending asunder by the fear of Allah. Such are the parables which We put forward to mankind that they may reflect.\nMEANING: The Noble Quran is so powerful and Allah – The Mighty, The Wise – is to be feared so much that even a mountain [massive as it is] would have been inadequate and would have crumbled under the awesome power of the Quran.\nTHE DIVINE PARABLES 44 of 49.\n DONKEY [62:5] The likeness of those who were entrusted with the (obligation of the) Taurat (Torah) (i.e. to obey its commandments and to practice its legal laws), but who subsequently failed in those (obligations), is as the likeness of a donkey who carries huge burdens of books (but understands nothing from them). How bad is the example (or the likeness) of people who deny the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allah. And Allah guides not the people who are Zalimoon (polytheists, wrong-doers, disbelievers, etc.).\nMEANING: Those given the responsibility of implementing the law of Moses [A.S.]. But their failing to implement it is likened to a donkey which carries thick, complicated books, but who does not understand what is in them. They made innovations to the laws due to their wicked character and, therefore, became misguided.\nTHE DIVINE PARABLES 45 of 49.\n(45) WIVES OF NUH, LUTH & FIRAWN.(66: 10) Allah sets forth an example for those who disbelieve, the wife of Nooh (Noah) and the wife of Lout (Lot). They were under two of our righteous slaves, but they both betrayed their (husbands by rejecting their doctrine) so they (Nooh (Noah) and Lout (Lot) ) benefited them (their respective wives) not, against Allah, and it was said: “Enter the Fire along with those who enter!\nMEANING: It is only Allah that gives guidance, not even the prophets can give guidance to their relatives; associating with pious people is not enough to earn us paradise unless we strive to sincerely believe in Allah & work in righteousness too. Also, the reward of betrayal of Iman is eternal doom.\nTHE DIVINE PARABLES 46 of 49.\n(46) WIFE OF PHARAOH & MARY; MOTHER OF JESUS (66:11-12).\n“11.And Allah has set forth an example for those who believe, the wife of Firaun (Pharaoh), when she said: “My Lord! Build for me a home with You in Paradise, and save me from Firaun (Pharaoh) and his work, and save me from the people who are Zalimoon (polytheists, wrong-doers and disbelievers in Allah). 12. And Maryam (Mary), the daughter of Imran who guarded her chastity; and We breathed into (the sleeve of her shirt or her garment) through Our Rooh (i.e. Jibrael (Gabriel)), and she testified to the truth of the Words of her Lord (i.e. believed in the Words of Allah: “Be!” and he was; that is Iesa (Jesus) son of Maryam (Mary); as a Messenger of Allah), and (also believed in) His Scriptures, and she was of the Qaniteen (i.e. obedient to Allah).\nMEANING: The wife of pharaoh (firawn) remained a believer despite being the wife of one of the greatest oppressors in history who tortured her in the worst of manners. This is a message for all Muslims ; that there is no obedience to the creation in disobedience to the creator. A woman is not expected to obey her husband if he commands her to disobey Allah directly or indirectly. Mary; mother of Jesus was declared one of the best women in the history of humans because of her sublime example of chastity ,Love of the worship of Allah, patience in the face of the adversity of accusation of fornication etc.\nTHE DIVINE PARABLES 47 of 49 .\n IF STREAM OF WATER BE LOST [67:30] Say (O Muhammad SAW): “Tell me! If (all) your water were to be sunk away, who then can supply you with flowing (spring) water?”\nMEANING: Allah has created fresh water and the rain cycle. Allah challenges the polytheist Arabs by asking them that if their stream became diverted to an underground cavern, then who could supply them with fresh water [this hints at the impotence of the idols that they worshipped].\nTHE DIVINE PARABLES 48 of 49 .\n PEOPLE OF THE GARDEN [68:17-33] Verily, We have tried them as We tried the people of the garden, when they swore to pluck the fruits of the (garden) in the morning,18. Without saying: Insha Allah (If Allah will).19. Then there passed by on the (garden) something (fire) from your Lord at night and burnt it while they were asleep. 20. So the (garden) became black by the morning, like a pitch dark night (in complete ruins). 21. Then they called out one to another as soon as the morning broke, 22. Saying: “Go to your tilth in the morning, if you would pluck the fruits.” 23. So they departed, conversing in secret low tones (saying), 24. No Miskeen (poor man) shall enter upon you into it today. 25. And they went in the morning with strong intention, thinking that they have power (to prevent the poor taking anything of the fruits therefrom). 26. But when they saw the (garden), they said: “Verily, we have gone astray,” 27. (Then they said): “Nay! Indeed we are deprived of (the fruits)!” 28. The best among them said: “Did I not tell you: why do you not say: Insha Allah (If Allah will).” 29. They said: “Glory to Our Lord! Verily, we have been Zalimoon (wrong-doers, etc.).” 30. Then they turned, one against another, in blaming. 31. They said: “Woe to us! Verily, we were Taghoon (transgressors and disobedient, etc.) 32. We hope that our Lord will give us in exchange a better (garden) than this. Truly, we turn to our Lord (wishing for good that He may forgive our sins, and reward us in the Hereafter).” 33. Such is the punishment (in this life), but truly, the punishment of the Hereafter is greater, if they but knew.\nMEANING: Proud people were punished by Allah for deciding to harvest their fruits without saying, ‘Insha Allah’ [if Allah wills it]. While they slept, all the fruit disappeared [as it had already been harvested] so that the fields were entirely barren. When it was dawn, the owners decided to gather their harvest in total secrecy. But when they saw their desolate fields, they knew that they had been selfish and avaricious. They began to repent, hoping for even better land. Allah says that He can inflict punishment in the world as he sees fit, but the punishment after death will be far worse – if only souls could see it in this world!\nTHE DIVINE PARABLES 49 of 49 .\n(49) OVER IT ARE NINETEEN (74: 30-31) 30. Over it are nineteen (angels as guardians and keepers of Hell).31. And We have set none but angels as guardians of the Fire, and We have fixed their number (19 nineteen) only as a trial for the disbelievers, in order that the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) may arrive at a certainty (that this Quran is the truth as it agrees with their Books i.e. their number (19 nineteen) is written in the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel (Gospel)) and the believers may increase in Faith (as this Quran is the truth) and that no doubts may be left for the people of the Scripture and the believers, and that those in whose hearts is a disease (of hypocrisy) and the disbelievers may say: “What Allah intends by this (curious) example ?” Thus Allah leads astray whom He wills and guides whom He wills. And none can know the hosts of your Lord but He. And this (Hell) is nothing else than a (warning) reminder to mankind.\nThe main subject matter of this parable is the number (19 nineteen).Allah made the number nineteen(19) a trial for the unbelievers as they would keep wondering about it , ridiculing it, rather than take heed, it gives certainty & confirmation of the message of the Qur’an to the people of the book & it strengthens the believers in faith because the true believers accept whatever Allah says & have no doubt about it.\nAnyone who opens his/her heart or whose heart is not totally closed to the truth, to the Guidance provided by ALLAH in the Qur’an must become a believer if he or she is not already one . Those sinners who end up in Hell cannot blame God for their calamity. They were warned to follow the Truth , to believe and then work righteously, but they did not believe or do good deeds. They followed the desires of their own ‘self’ [‘nafs’]. They failed to follow Allah’s Guidance. The parables in the Qur’an are a part of Allah’s Guidance! So follow the messages contained in the Parables before it is too late.

{"question":"What are the key differences between ale and lager yeast in terms of fermentation characteristics and reusability?","answer":"Ale and lager yeasts differ in several ways: Ale yeast is top-fermenting while lager yeast is bottom-fermenting. Ale yeast ferments at higher temperatures and acts quicker, while lager yeast performs best at lower temperatures and takes longer to complete fermentation. Regarding reusability, ale yeast is more resilient, whereas lager yeast can fade out after 7-8 uses.","context":["Part 4/4 - Yeast, the Magician\nWelcome back! We hope you have been busy exploring all the unique beers available over the holidays and in to the late winter. We have been. There is a lot to talk about, but last but not least we need to talk about the 4th and final ingredient in our 4 part series about beer: yeast!\nWithout yeast in beer you have a barley and hop soup. Yeast is a simple yet complex ingredient. It can be found naturally nearly everywhere, but is also hard to control. In the brewing process yeast is somewhat a sacred part of the beer.\nGetting down to the basics, there are two main of strains of yeast that divide beer into two main styles of beer: ales and lagers. Nearly every beer drinker is familiar with these two types. You can take the exact same recipe of malt, water and hops and by changing the yeast you significantly change the overall character of a beer.\nSo what does yeast do?\nYeast is added once the barley and hops have been processed appropriately in the hot water mixture mixture. This process is called 'pitching'. In either an ale or lager the process is the same, the yeast performs the function of breaking down the sugar from barley (or whatever other forms of sugar were added to the batch) and turning them into alcohol. This is the process known as fermentation. This is what creates the alcohol in beer and gives it the foaminess that we have all come to love. As fermentation happens sugar is converted to alcohol and carbon dioxide is released.\nAle vs. Lager Yeast\nThere are a few differences between ale and lager yeast. Ale yeast is referred to as top fermenting and lager yeast is bottom fermenting. These are generic references and simply mean when either of the yeasts are pitched they ferment the beer from the top of the fermenter or the bottom. Beyond the basic top and bottom difference, they also ferment best at different temperatures and speeds. Ale yeast usually ferments at a higher temperature and acts quicker whereas lager yeast performs best at a slightly lower temperature and usually takes longer to finish the fermentation.\nOn a side note, another cool thing about yeast is that it is reusable. Yeast can be skimmed off the top or bottom of a batch of beer and reused in another batch. Over time reusing the yeast will make the flavouring properties change. Ale yeast tends to be a bit more resilient whereas lager yeast can fade out after 7-8 uses.\nWhy does it matter?\nSo really why would I care about yeast?\nIf you are a person that enjoys beer of any type, yeast may actually be the factor that hinges your entire preference. Ales and their yeast varieties usually produce a more full bodied beer. Lager yeast gives a lighter body.\nBreweries go through extreme lengths during the fermentation process ensuring yeast reacts just the way they want it to provide the certain flavour they are seeking. For example; Duvel, the world famous Belgian Golden Strong Ale uses a variety of yeasts to ferment, moving it through different temperature ranges and conditions, before it is put in the bottle (with more yeast) to become the ultra foamy, complex, and beautiful golden colour. This is an amazingly elegant beer that has become world famous, mainly through the careful attention the brewery gives the yeast.\nSome flavours you may taste coming from yeast are things like: banana, clove, raisin, barnyard, and other subtle fruit flavours. Yeast can be open fermented in a large vat or closed fermented in a vessel. In either case the brewery must ensure that there are no unwanted natural yeast that make its way into the beer, so the fermentation stage must be somewhat protected and the beer not disturbed once the yeast is added.\nYeast can certainly not be overlooked as it can make or break a beer. Malted barley or hops can both be substituted with other forms of ingredients to derive fermentable sugars or bitterness and preservation. Yeast is the key that makes it all happen and ties the ingredients together to transform everything into the beverage we all love.\nOnce again thanks for reading!

Look for us on the street and book a tour if you'd like to learn more about beer and get to know Saint John a bit better.\nOnce again here is a shortlist of what is happening on the beer scene right now!\n1. Beer to Drink Now! - Aphrodisiac Ale, Picaroons - Only around for a bit longer and till clinging on to that loving feeling from Valentines Day. This is a great flavoured beer that has subtle chili notes with chocolate taste. Light bodied and interesting; it won't last long.\n2. Gateway Beer! - Old Growth ESB, Maybe Brewing Company - Extra Special Bitters' (ESB) would usually not be a great beer to introduce someone to hop forwardness, but this one presents itself very delightfully. It is not in your face with hops, but you know they are there. A great beer for someone who is interested in the craft scene but hasn't made the leap yet. They just need to get past the name. It is barely bitter.\n3. Most Crowd Pleasing! - Ruckus IPA, Long Bay Brewery - Available at the brewery, on tap, and now in bottles. A seriously drinkable IPA. Quality and juiciness at every sip. So easy to drink. A great IPA all around. Hopefully this one sticks around. It will certainly become a staple Uptown.\n4. Most Adventurous! - One Hot Minute, Hammond River Brewing - Yes another beer with chilies added. This one is spicy. But that all subsides after a few sips. A really interesting beer that is not for everyone, but you have to try. High quality and tasty. This will keep your belly warm and is great for anyone that likes chili heat.\nStay tuned for our next post! Cheers!

{"question":"What is the projected global impact of antimicrobial resistance by 2050, and how does Universal Health Coverage help combat this crisis?","answer":"By 2050, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is projected to cause 10 million deaths annually and wipe off US$ 100 trillion from the global economy. Additionally, global exports will decrease by up to 3.5%, livestock production will diminish by 7.5%, and healthcare costs will increase by US$ 1 trillion. Universal Health Coverage (UHC) helps combat AMR by improving access to quality antimicrobials, promoting rational use through standardized treatment protocols, expanding preventive services like vaccination to reduce disease burden, and strengthening health systems governance. UHC also reduces out-of-pocket expenditure and improves access to essential health services, particularly benefiting vulnerable populations.","context":["The world is faced with an antimicrobial resistance (AMR) crisis that threatens to throw our health and medical practices back to the Dark Ages according to a report released by economist Jim O’Neill.\nThe report estimates that even today 700,000 people a year die of resistant infections around the world, and that this is likely to rise to 10 million lives a year by 2050, with an estimated cost to the world economy of £69 trillion a year.\nThe report sets out a 10 point plan to combat the problem, that needs to be implemented globally to be fully effective.\nWhat is antimicrobial resistance?\nAntimicrobials are a range of medicines used to treat infections caused by bacteria (antibiotics), viruses (antivirals) and parasites (antiparasitics). Resistance to these medicines arises in microbes by an evolutionary process.\nFor instance, when a bacteria is treated with an antibiotic, some individual bacteria may have acquired mutations that make them more resistant to being killed. This allows them to survive the treatment and reproduce and pass down this mutated antibiotic resistance gene to all their offspring.\nEvolution works fast in bacteria due to their high reproduction rate. E. coli can reproduce every 20 mins, so one resistant bacteria can become over a million cells in just 20 hours. The evolutionary process is also aided by bacterial cells mutating at a much faster rate than human cells.\nIt is a thorough report and provides many sensible suggestions as to how to tackle this crisis. The problem is, the majority of these suggestions have been proposed before, and not acted upon. I attended the BA Festival of Science at the University of Salford in 2003 where antimicrobial resistance was a topic discussed. Then, suggestions such as prescribing less antibiotics, cutting down the use of antibiotics in livestock, creating new antibiotics, public awareness and investigating alternatives were being discussed.\nVery little has been done since then to promote any of these good ideas, which have all reappeared in this current report. The problem of antimicrobial resistance was on the radar of the European Parliament as far back as 2001 when a resolution was passed on the prudent use of antimicrobials in human medicine.\nMore resolutions, conclusions, recommendation and regulations have followed every few years since, each time trumpeted by a scientific luminary in the press, with little more result than a round of letters being posted to doctors advising them to prescribe less antibiotics.\nBig Pharma’s failure\nHopefully change will follow this current report which does go into the reasons we have failed to deal with problems in the past. The world is highly dependant on Big Pharma to bring drugs to the market; unfortunately, antibiotics are not generally profitable for Big Pharma, so they do very little research on them and very few new antibiotics have reached the shelves since the 1980’s.\nO’Neill, uses the term “market failure” throughout the report to describe the failure of Big Pharma to produce the new antimicrobials the world desperately needs. He hopes to change this by the report influencing the G20 meeting in September so they will:\nsupport new innovation – including mechanisms to pool global funds to stimulate the development of antibiotics and diagnostics. It is vital that the market failures in the pipeline for new antibiotics are fixed, and that more successful products come to market.\nTo fix these market failures and help produce funds to promote antimicrobial research and development he makes a number of suggestions, including:\na market entry reward system where up to $1.3 billion would be paid to the successful developer of a new antibiotic (money paid when drug enters market).\nAn antibiotic investment charge, which would operate like a tax on firms selling pharmaceutical and healthcare products. The tax could be deferred if the company could show they were investing a similar amount into R&D of antimicrobials, referred to as a ‘pay or play’ system.\nA tax on antibiotics – which the author also hopes would restrict use slightly.\nThe market entry reward level suggested is probably not high enough to incentivise Big Pharma to work on antimicrobials. A study by the Tufts Centre For the Study Of Drug Development calculated the cost of developing a prescription drug that gains market approval at $2.6 billion.\nThe pay or play system has already been rejected by the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, Dr Virginia Acha, director of research, medical and innovation was reported to say in the Guardian:\n[It] fails to recognise the need for a collaborative response which this long-term review has consistently identified… Putting the onus on any one group will not solve the problem and is not a sustainable solution.\nBig Pharma is a powerful lobbyist of the government in the UK, and the lobbyists are already probably hard at work, whispering into the ears of the cabinet and discrediting the pay and play system. I can see the headlines now of the Big Pharma CEO’s spitting their dummies out and threatening to take their research toys to a more exotic location if it is introduced.\nA tax on antibiotics would hit the poor hardest, and it is the poorer countries that are expected to suffer more from antimicrobial resistance, and so is unfair.\nGlobal Innovation Fund\nA much more appealing recommendation for the funding of R&D into AMR is the Global Innovation Fund (GIF), which is planned to fund early stage research into drug discovery and other areas relevant to AMR, as well as research into how to use better what we already have. It is proposed the fund will be endowed with $2 billion over five years from public funds. The UK and Chinese governments have so far committed £100 million ($145 million) to the fund.\nThe GIF is also earmarked to fund not-for-profit initiatives and will assist/run alongside initiatives like the Global Antibiotic Research & Development (GARD) programme, which is a new not-for-profit development partnership supported by the World Health Organisation.\nI believe GIF and GARD provide the best of opportunity of making progress with R&D into AMR at reasonable costs. The good work that the World Health Organisation and its supporting countries and organisations (once they got up to speed) did in combatting the Ebola virus by developing a vaccine in record time, points to them being a very useful force in the fight against AMR.\nAntibiotic abuse in agriculture\nAnother major concern of the report is the overuse of antibiotics given to livestock. Antibiotics are used to quell infections developing in overcrowded farm animals, which could be reduced by better farming practices. Often they are given simply to promote growth in the animal. The antibiotics used are often ones that are important to human health, and the resistance acquired by bacteria in the animals can be passed to bacteria that can infect humans, in certain conditions, by a process called transformation.\nIn 2003 when I was researching this subject, bacterial resistance to vancomycin was of concern due to it being a last line antibiotic (which means it is the last chance to treat an infection when all else has failed) and also commonly used in treating livestock. There was some evidence to suggest then that vancomycin resistance had been transmitted from bacteria that infected livestock, to bacteria that infected humans. In 2012 it was reported that a lineage of the hospital superbug methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) had also picked up resistance to vancomycin.\nAlthough this development can’t be traced directly back to treating animals with vancomycin, there is a strong possibility that it was a factor involved. And the report states in a review of the relevant literature:\nonly five percent concluded that there was no evidence of a link between antibiotic use in animals and resistance in humans, while nearly three quarters concluded that there is evidence of such a link.\nIn the USA, of the antibiotics that are important for maintaining human health, over 70% of the total volume used are sold for use in animals. The report proposes a 10 year target to reduce antibiotic use in global agriculture and also suggests restrictions/bans on certain highly critical antibiotics, with improved transparency from food producers on the antibiotics used to treat the livestock we eat.\nDiagnostic tools & alternative solutions\nThe report laments the fact that nothing has changed since the 1950’s in the way antibiotics are prescribed to people. Doctors have to rely on the symptoms presented to them to determine whether to prescribe antibiotics. Unfortunately, viral and bacterial infections can produce very similar symptoms. A bacterial infection may be resistant to the first antibiotic given, and antibiotics have no effect against viruses, so antibiotics are often prescribed inappropriately.\nIn the USA, 40 million people a year are prescribed antibiotics for respiratory issues. It is estimated 27 million of these get antibiotics unnecessarily.\nTo combat this, the report suggests that rapid diagnostic tools should be used to\ndetermine the type of infection prior to prescribing the medication. This is an excellent idea but unfortunately these tools have yet to be developed.\nI was very pleased to see bacteriophage (viruses which kill bacteria) mentioned as an alternative to antibiotic use. They have an amazing structure, and look like they would be as comfortable landing on the surface of a moon as the surface of a bacteria.\nResearch was done into bacteriophage use to treat bacterial infections in the Soviet Union. However, work on them finished when the Soviet Union collapsed and bacteriophage therapy fell out of fashion due to mistrust of the Soviet science carried out and the availability of antibiotics to do the job.\nCan this plan work?\nThe plan to combat AMR, as set out in the report, is a rational one and has every chance of succeeding if it is implemented globally in a timely fashion. And global implementation is crucial, as the report itself states, because uncooperative countries could act as a reservoir of antimicrobial resistance which could then easily spread to other countries, via people travelling, and undo their good work.\nThe AMR problem has a lot of parallels with the problems of climate change, as both require a global solution and agreement between many countries. So I was surprised to see no mention of climate change or global warming within this report. This is important as climate change is predicted by the World Health Organisation to increase infectious disease transmission.\nObserving the difficulties involved in the increasing number of unsuccessful climate change summits leads me to believe that herding cats may be an easier proposition than gaining global consensus on a major issue such as AMR. But we can only live in hope, as long some superbug doesn’t kill us first.\nFeatured image via Connor Conway\nFund our Investigations Unit\nYou can help us investigate corruption, expose injustice and uncover the truth.\nAs one of the only independent investigations units in the country, we work for you – but we need your help to keep going.

Universal health coverage framework to combat antimicrobial resistance. Indian J Med Res 2018;147:228-32\nRecent United Nations General Assembly political resolution on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) articulates serious concerns of the global community, including the political leadership at the highest level on the impact of this burgeoning issue with profound implications not only on human health but more so on economy, food security and overall human development . The review on AMR projects AMR causing 10 million deaths annually and wiping off a massive cumulative US$ 100 trillion from economy by 2050 as a consequence of inaction to contain AMR . This report also estimates that mortality due to AMR globally shall exceed those due to cancers and road accidents put together. Moreover, most of these deaths will be in developing countries creating greater impact on health and economy. Data from World Bank reveal that global exports will see a decrease of up to 3.5 per cent, livestock production will diminish by 7.5 per cent and additional healthcare-related costs will be staggering US$ 1 trillion by 2050.\nAt clinical and public health platforms, patients with infections caused by drug-resistant bacteria are at increased risk of worse clinical outcomes and death and consume more healthcare resources than patients infected with non-resistant strains of the same bacteria  Outbreaks with resistant strains lead to serious outcomes. The WHO estimates that carbapenem antibiotics which are the last resort treatment for Klebsiella pneumoniae infections do not work in more than half of the people treated for hospital-associated infections due to this organism, fluoroquinolone resistance in Escherichia More Details coli has become widespread and is ineffective in 50 per cent patients in some geographical areas. Ten countries have reported treatment failure in gonorrhoea to third-generation cephalosporins. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) are firmly entrenched in healthcare facilities making people infected with MRSA, 64 per cent more likely to die than people with a non-resistant form of the infection .\nAMR is a public health concern in India. Carbapenem-resistant isolates of K. pneumoniae increased from 29 per cent in 2008 to 57 per cent in 2014 and MRSA showed an increase of 18 per cent during this period . Seventy eight per cent of clinical isolates of Neisseria More Details gonorrhoeae were resistant to ciprofloxacin . Sixty one per cent of E. coli were extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers . Acinetobacter species responsible for hospital-associated infections in a tertiary care hospital in Delhi showed 57-80 per cent resistance to imipenem .\nThe health sector has been developing various strategies and plans to combat AMR. Its complexities and various competing national priorities demand a strategic, efficient and cost-effective doable approach that can yield rich dividend in short term. Although almost one hundred countries in the world have drafted their respective national action plans, almost all are finding it difficult to initiate implementation of their national action plans against AMR because of the complexity and internecine nature of the problem. It is neither technically nor financially feasible to have a stand-alone national programme, especially in developing countries. These countries have to thus identify a point of entry for AMR implementation that is doable, practical and feasible. This article discusses about universal health coverage (UHC) initiative as a possible and workable entry point for AMR national action plans as well as an ideal enabling platform since it can support various AMR specific as well as AMR sensitive interventions .\nUHC is the aspiration that all people obtain quality promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative and palliative health services without suffering financial hardship paying for them. It occupies a prominent place in the United Nation's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs),. UHC is dependent on an efficient health system. At the same time, countries with strong health system shall indeed have better outcomes from their UHC activities. Its successful implementation from now onwards shall strengthen health system in the countries which have traditionally suffered from weak health systems providing comprehensive benefits to people.\nUHC is recognized as a development promoting endeavour that carries tremendous potential to enhance economic growth by enabling adults to work and earn an income and children obtain an education, thus keeping them away from poverty. It thus neutralizes a major impact of AMR of pushing people into avoidable poverty. World Bank estimates that if left uncontrolled AMR shall push 28 million people into poverty . Accordingly, AMR containment through UHC can be the key to achieving the World Bank Group's twin goals of ending extreme poverty and increasing equity and shared prosperity ,. UHC can act as an enabling platform through improved governance, an expanded coverage in activities such as vaccination, preventative care and hygiene measures that reduce disease burden thus bringing about a proportionate reduction of antimicrobial agents and resultant spread of resistance; improved supervision that assures use of standardized protocol leading to rational use of antimicrobials; improving access to affordable antimicrobials and systematic approach to complex problem of AMR. UHC improves access to health services and dramatically reduce out-of-pocket expenditure by the communities especially the poorer segments.\nA WHO and World Bank Group report launched in 2015 showed that 400 million people did not have access to essential health services leading to significant out-of-pocket expenditure. At 62 per cent, India's out-of-pocket expenditure for health is one of the highest in the world . To overcome this and in alignment with global initiatives, India is embarking on an ambitious target of achieving UHC for all .\nOne of the major interventions in overall fight against AMR is improving access of antimicrobial agents to vulnerable populations. Through UHC, this becomes feasible as improving access aligns with the core UHC objective.\nAll UN Member States have agreed to try to achieve UHC by 2030, as part of the SDGs. Several countries have already initiated UHC reforms. UHC is being recognized even by developing countries as a revolutionary public health aspiration to catalyze development and negate several ill-effects of poor health. Given the pan-global prevalence of resistant pathogens , UHC comes out to be the ideal platform for extending activities that prevent and contain AMR.\nUHC is not just about health financing. It strengthens all components of the health system. The UHC promoted strong health system shall be better equipped to launch effective measures to contain AMR. UHC impacts all key elements of WHO Global Action Plan on AMR [Figure 1].\n|Figure 1: Linkages between objectives of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) action plan and key elements of Universal Health Coverage (UHC). Objectives of WHO Global Action Plan (GAP) on AMR are shown in bold. UHC key elements influencing specific GAP objectives are shown in red.|\nClick here to view\nRecognizing that sustainability of financing is one of the most important challenges to achieve UHC, World Bank and other partners are financing UHC in several developing countries. At the same time, implementation of AMR stands at risk of getting hampered because of inadequate or erratic availability of resources. Instead of lobbying for significant budgets from dwindling and finite global resources for development purposes, it will be cost-effective for AMR activities to dovetail into UHC. It shall promote access to quality antimicrobials and their rational use.\nUHC under its pillar of providing quality health care shall be using standard treatment guidelines and quality antimicrobial agents for common ailments including diarrhoeal diseases and acute respiratory infections (ARI). These will substantially reduce widespread indiscriminate use of antimicrobial agents including those of questionable quality in ARI and diarrhoea .\nUHC aims to expand health services to cover entire population in a geographical area. Apart from curative services, UHC has a focus on preventive services, especially vaccination and disease prevention interventions, which shall contribute to a reduction in disease burden. This shall lower the need for antimicrobials and thus prevent emergence and spread of AMR.\nThe confidence of community in sustained availability of quality health care through stronger health system under UHC will prevent the storing and self-medication of antimicrobial agents. It may catalyze a behavioural change in the community towards rational use of antimicrobials by them.\nOn working under the broad umbrella of UHC, AMR activities shall derive management benefits from UHC's inbuilt service delivery, outreach and logistics related components. Apart from efficient utilization of available human resource, data management and infrastructure under UHC, bulk procurement of antimicrobials shall reduce the cost and improve the quality of these agents. A robust UHC approach shall build systems governance and coordination capacities that will be critical for the AMR fight.\nUHC has been prominently public-sector approach. Given the growing importance of private sector in several countries, UHC needs to engage and establish workable linkages with private sector for improving efficacy and reach of UHC for AMR containment. As with many other developing countries, India's current public healthcare spending and infrastructure is currently well short of what is required to fulfil its ambition of achieving universal health care . Ninety three per cent of all health facilities in India belong to private sector; and hence, public-private-partnership (PPP) will have to play a major role . Several successful PPP models have emerged over the last few years. Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojana, launched in 2008, has been successful in enhancing health coverage for poor households in India . However, for a nation-wide successful implementation of UHC for AMR containment several such PPPs need to be established and nurtured.\n| Can Amr Be Measured Within Uhc?|| |\nTogether with the World Bank, WHO has developed a framework to track the progress of UHC . WHO uses indicators in four categories, namely, reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health, infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases and service capacity and access (including access to essential medicines). Within the category of infectious diseases, it is proposed to measure TB treatment, HIV antiretroviral treatment, coverage of insecticide-treated bed nets for malaria prevention and adequate sanitation. It is feasible to include at least a few critical indicators from respective National Action Plans into the framework of monitoring and evaluation of UHC.\n| How to Move Forward?|| |\nAMR integration in UHC should be undertaken optimistically but cautiously. While AMR sensitization of the implementers of UHS is important, primary objectives of UHC must not get diluted. This requires continuous dialogue and discussions at policy and programmatic level between senior managers of UHC and AMR for better understanding and coordination. A step-by-step approach is essential. UHC governance mechanism should have AMR national focal point on its highest decision-making and planning committee. At peripheral level also, a dedicated AMR person should be part of implementing mechanism to ensure efficient coordination, seamless integration and effective response. An approach suggested by Marie-Paul and Evan  for implementation of UHC can also be utilized for integration of AMR in its framework. This approach calls for sustained funding, fair distribution of resources, motivated health workforce, quality services and efficient referral services in addition to strengthening primary health care and making all services accessible to everyone.\n| Challenges|| |\nUHC is health oriented. AMR is strongly influenced by significant use of antimicrobials in both animal health and agriculture sectors as well as the availability of these agents in various environments especially hospital and industrial effluents. Awareness among communities and local officials may catalyze implementation of a One Health Policy by bringing in other sectors within its ambit thus catalyzing a multisectoral approach and promoting a cascading effect.\n| Conclusions|| |\nAMR is not only a health issue. It has serious development dimensions and impact on poverty. AMR has the potential to augment extreme poverty. The efforts being made by the global community to eliminate extreme poverty (at $1.90/day) by 2030 is at serious risk if the problem of AMR is not tackled aggressively .\nDeveloping countries desire to contain AMR are facing several technical and management challenges . Solutions that are workable at local level have to be identified and implemented. Several solutions are inbuilt into UHC and can be fine-tuned to generate AMR sensitive and AMR specific actions without creating a new resource-intensive structures. Implementation of UHC shall vary from country to country and hence the integration of AMR in UHC has to be tailor-made to be context specific.

{"question":"How do the mythological origins and religious significance of Jupiter compare to the historical development of the 7-day week, particularly regarding their connection to ancient Roman culture and astronomy?","answer":"Both Jupiter and the 7-day week have strong connections to ancient Roman culture and astronomy. Jupiter was the supreme deity of the Roman pantheon, adapted from the Greek Zeus, and was closely linked to the founding and military might of Rome. The 7-day week was established as an imperial calendar in the late Roman empire, though it was known in Rome before Christianity. Both systems incorporated astronomical elements - Jupiter was a sky god associated with thunder and storms, while the seven-day week was correlated to the seven 'planets' known to the ancients (Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn). The days of the week were named after these celestial bodies in many languages, demonstrating how both religious and astronomical concepts were intertwined in ancient Roman culture.","context":["seven day week has been used for millennia by the Christian,\nJewish, Islamic, and Chinese calendars, yet its origins are\nWhat Is the\nOrigin of the 7-Day Week?\nthe history of the 7-day week is a very complicated matter.\nAuthorities have very different opinions about the history\nof the week, and they frequently present their speculations\nas if they were indisputable facts. The only thing we seem\nto know for certain about the origin of the 7-day week is\nthat we know nothing for certain.\nThe common explanation is that the seven-day week was established\nas imperial calendar in the late Roman empire and furthered\nby the Christian church for historical reasons. The British\nEmpire used the seven-day week and spread it worldwide. Today\nthe seven-day week is enforced by global business and media\nschedules, especially television and banking.The first pages\nof the Bible explain how God created the world in six days\nand rested on the seventh. This seventh day became the Jewish\nday of rest, the sabbath, Saturday.Extra-biblical locations\nsometimes mentioned as the birthplace of the 7-day week include:\nBabylon, Persia, and several others. The week was known in\nRome before the advent of Christianity.\nThere are practical geometrical theories as well. For example,\nif you wrap a rubber band around 7 soda cans (or any other\nconvenient circular objects). You get a perfect hexagon with\nthe 7th can in the middle. It is the only stable configuration\nof wrapping more than 3 circular objects. Four, 5, and 6 objects\nwill slip from one configuration to another. Ancients wrapping\ntent poles, small logs for firewood, or other ciruclar objects\nmight have come upon this number and attach a mystical significance\nOne viable theory correlates the seven day week to the seven\n(astrological) \"planets\" known to the ancients:\nSun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, and Saturn. The\nnumber seven does not seem an obvious choice to match lunar\nor solar periods, however. A solar year could be more evenly\ndivided into weeks of 5 days, and the moon phases five-day\nand six-day weeks make a better short term fit (6 times 5\nis 30) to the lunar (synodic) month (of about 29.53 days)\nthan the current week (4 times 7 is 28). The seven-day week\nmay have been chosen because its length approximates one moon\nphase (one quarter = 29.53 / 4 = 7.3825).\nDo the Names of the Days of the Week Mean?\nAn answer to\nthis question is necessarily closely linked to the language\nin question. Whereas most languages use the same names for\nthe months (with a few Slavonic languages as notable exceptions),\nthere is great variety in names that various languages use\nfor the days of the week. A few examples will be given here.\nExcept for the sabbath, Jews\nsimply number their week days.\nA related method is partially\nused in Portuguese and Russian:\nof Russian name\nlanguages connect each day of the week with one of the seven\n\"planets\" of the ancient times: Sun, Moon, Mercury,\nVenus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. French, for example, uses:\nThe link with\nthe sun has been broken in French, but Sunday was called dies\nsolis (day of the sun) in Latin.\nIt is interesting to note that also some Asiatic languages\n(for example, Hindi, Japanese, and Korean) have a similar\nrelationship between the week days and the planets.English\nhas retained the original planets in the names for Saturday,\nSunday, and Monday. For the four other days, however, the\nnames of Anglo-Saxon or Nordic gods have replaced the Roman\ngods that gave name to the planets. Thus, Tuesday is named\nafter Tiw, Wednesday is named after Woden, Thursday is named\nafter Thor, and Friday is named after Freya.\nconnotations of the days of the week from a sampling of cultures\nand time periods.\nis the System behind the Planetary Day Names?\nAs we saw\nin the previous section, the planets have given the week days\ntheir names following this order:\nMercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Sun\nWhy this particular\ngoes as follows: If you order the \"planets\" according\nto either their presumed distance from Earth (assuming the\nEarth to be the center of the universe) or their period of\nrevolution around the Earth, you arrive at this order: Moon,\nMercury, Venus, Sun, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn\n(in reverse order) these planets to the hours of the day:\n3=Mars, 4=Sun, 5=Venus, 6=Mercury, 7=Moon, 8=Saturn, 9=Jupiter,\netc., 23=Jupiter, 24=Mars\nThen next day\nwill then continue where the old day left off:\netc., 23=Venus, 24=Mercury\nAnd the next\nday will go\nIf you look\nat the planet assigned to the first hour of each day, you\nwill note that the planets come in this order:\nMoon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus\nThis is exactly\nthe order of the associated week days.\nthe 7-Day Week Cycle Ever Been Interrupted?\nno record of the 7-day week cycle ever having been broken.\nCalendar changes and reform have never interrupted the 7-day\ncycles. It very likely that the week cycles have run uninterrupted\nat least since the days of Moses (c. 1400 B.C.E.), possibly\nclaim that the ancient Jews used a calendar in which an extra\nSabbath was occasionally introduced. But this is probably\nDay is the Day of Rest?\nJews, the Sabbath (Saturday) is the day of rest and worship.\nOn this day God rested after creating the world.\nhave made Sunday their day of rest and worship, because Jesus\nrose from the dead on a Sunday.\nFriday as their day of rest and worship. The Qur'an calls\nFriday a holy day, the \"king of days.\"\nIs the First Day of the Week?\nclearly makes the Sabbath the last day of the week, but does\nnot share how that corresponds to our 7 day week. Yet through\nextra-biblical sources it is possible to determine that the\nSabbath at the time of Christ corresponds to our current 'Saturday.'\nTherefore it is common Jewish and Christian practice to regard\nSunday as the first day of the week (as is also evident from\nthe Portuguese names for the week days). However, the fact\nthat, for example, Russian uses the name \"second\"\nfor Tuesday, indicates that some nations regard Monday as\nthe first day.\nstandard ISO-8601 the International Organization for Standardization\n(ISO) has decreed that Monday shall be the first day of the\nIs the Week Number?\nstandard ISO-8601 assigns a number to each week of the year.\nA week that lies partly in one year and partly in another\nis assigned a number in the year in which most of its days\nlie.

But if you define a \"week\" as a named\ninterval that is greater than a day and smaller than a month,\nthe answer is yes.\nEgyptians used a 10-day \"week\", as did the French\nRevolutionary calendar (see French calendar).\nThe Maya calendar\nuses a 13 and a 20-day \"week\" (see Mayan calendar).\nUnion used both a 5-day and a 6-day week. In 1929-30 the USSR\ngradually introduced a 5-day week. Every worker had one day\noff every week, but there was no fixed day of rest. On 1 September 1931\nthis was replaced by a 6-day week with a fixed day of rest,\nfalling on the 6th, 12th, 18th, 24th, and 30th day of each\nmonth (1 March was used instead of the 30th day of February,\nand the last day of months with 31 days was considered an\nextra working day outside the normal 6-day week cycle).

He ruled as the dominant member of a triumvirate called the Capitoline Triad, which included his consort Juno and daughter Minerva. Jupiter bore many similarities to Zeus, the king of the Greek deities from whom he was adapted.\nUnlike Zeus, however, Jupiter was explicitly linked to a specific political entity—Rome. From the great temple erected in his honor on the Capitoline Hill in Rome, Jupiter presided over the state and its ever-expanding empire. As a result, the Romans emphasized the worship of Jupiter above all other gods. Jupiter’s blessings were thought to secure their victories and maintain hegemony over their rivals. Worship of Jupiter was formalized by the Roman state over the course of its existence.\nWhat is known of Jupiter’s mythos came not through the narratives in which he plays a role, but from the ways in which his worship was observed by the Romans. Like other figures in Roman mythology, Jupiter was believed to be a critical actor in Roman history. Accordingly, his nature and attributes transformed in order to keep up with broader historical changes in the Roman state. By the end of the first century BCE, Jupiter’s centrality to the state was eclipsed by cults devoted to the worship of deified emperors.\nIn Latin, the name “Jupiter” was usually rendered as Iūpiter or Iuppiter (the character “j” was not a part of ancient Latin alphabet, and was added in the Middle Ages). The name stemmed from two roots. One was the Proto Indo-European word dyeu- (the same root for the name “Zeus”!), meaning “shining thing,” “sky,” or “day” (as in the Latin for day dies); the other was pater, a word shared by Greek and Latin that means “father.” In keeping with these naming conventions, Jupiter was sometimes called Diespiter or Dispiter. Additionally, Zeus was called Zeu Pater in Greek, and Sanskrit speakers used the term Dyaus pitar (father of heavens) to refer to the sky god. This all points an archetypal “sky father” deep in the history of Indo-European-speaking people, whose identity was localized by the cultures that splintered off over time.1\nJupiter was known by a number of epithets. For bringing victory, he was Iuppiter Elicius, or “Jupiter who brings forth,” and for summoning lightning, he was Iuppiter Fulgur, or “lightning Jupiter.” For bringing light and enlightenment to all things, he was Iuppiter Lucetius, or “Jupiter of the light,” as well as Iuppiter Caelestis, or “Jupiter of the heavens.” Above all, he was Iuppiter Optimus Maximus: “Jupiter, the best and greatest.”\nAs the god of the sky, Jupiter commanded lightning, thunder, and storms. Like Zeus, he wielded lightning bolts as weapons. Befitting his role as king of the gods, Jupiter was commonly depicted sitting on a throne and holding a royal scepter and staff.\nRather than taking an active part in battles, however, Jupiter was imagined to oversee and control them. More than any other deity, Jupiter held the fate of the Roman state in the balance. To appease him, Romans offered sacrifice and took sacred oaths in his honor. The faithfulness with which they made sacrificial offerings and kept their oaths informed Jupiter’s bearing. The Romans came to believe that the success of their Mediterranean empire could be attributed to their unique devotion to Jupiter.\nBy way of the eagle, Jupiter also guided the taking of the auspices, the practice of divination whereby augurs tried to decipher omens and predict the future by observing the flight of birds (words such as “auspicious” and “inauspicious” come from this practice). Because the eagle was Jupiter’s sacred animal, the Romans believed that the bird’s behavior communicated his will. Omens divined through the behavior of eagles were considered to be the most revealing.\nJupiter was the son of Saturn—the god of the sky who preceded Jupiter—and Ops (or Opis), goddess of the earth and growth. His brothers were Neptune, god of the sea, and Pluto, god of the underworld and wealth (metals, the basis of Roman coinage and wealth, were found underground). His sisters included Ceres, a fertility goddess who controlled the growth of grains, Vesta, goddess of hearth and home, and Juno, a maternal goddess associated with marriage, family, domestic tranquility, and the moon.\nJupiter was married to his sister Juno, who served as the Roman counterpart to Hera. Among their children were Mars, the god of war that played a substantial role in the founding of Rome, and Bellona, a goddess of war. Additional children included Vulcan, the god of fire, metalworking, and the forge, and Juventus, a youthful goddess who oversaw the transition from childhood to adulthood and was associated with invigoration and rejuvenation.\nThough the Roman mythic corpus lacked the stories of marital strife that so often defined Zeus and Hera’s relationship, it was clear that Jupiter was unfaithful to Juno. Anecdotal tales told of Jupiter’s many infidelities and the children that resulted from them. With Maia, the goddess of earth and fertility (who may have lent her name to the Roman month Maius, or May), Jupiter had Mercury, the messenger god of commerce, merchants, sailing, and travel. With Dione, he sired Venus, goddess of love and sexual desire (although other stories had her emerging from sea foam, like the Greek Aphrodite). With his sister Ceres, Jupiter had Proserpine, an important cultic figure associated with cycles of decay and rebirth, just as Persephone was for the Greeks. Finally, with Metis, whom he raped, Jupiter had Minerva.\nBy and large, Roman mythology lacked a rich narrative tradition. As such, little exists in the way of epic stories explaining the order of the universe and the origins of humankind. This is also true of Jupiter, whose mythos was built not around stories that featured him as a main character, but around the ways that Romans observed their chief deity and explained his place in their storied history.\nJupiter’s origins were largely identical to the tales of Zeus’ creation. Before Jupiter, Saturn reigned supreme as the god of the sky and the universe. Of course, it had not always been that way. Before Saturn, his father Caelus (meaning “heavens”) ruled, but Saturn overthrew his father and took control of the heavens for himself. After Saturn married Ops and impregnated her, he learned of a prophecy foretelling his downfall at the hands of one of his children. To prevent the usurper from seeing life, he swallowed the first five children that sprang from Ops’ womb. When the last child finally emerged, Ops hid him away and gave Saturn a rock dressed in swaddling instead. An unsuspecting Saturn devoured the rock whole.\nWhat followed was the worst case of indigestion in the history of mythology. Unable to digest the rock, Saturn regurgitated it, along with the five children he had swallowed—Ceres, Juno, Neptune, Pluto, and Vesta. Jupiter, meanwhile, had been plotting his father’s imminent demise. With the help of his brothers and sisters, he defeated Saturn and took control of the cosmos.\nJupiter would later find himself in the same position as his father, Saturn. After raping and impregnating Metis, Jupiter was seized with the fear that his own unborn son might overthrow him. To avoid such a fate, Jupiter swallowed Metis along with her unborn child. Much to Jupiter’s surprise, the child did not die, but continued to grow until it burst from his forehead and into the world. That child was Minerva, the goddess of wisdom, forethought, and strategic warfare; she eventually became a part of the ruling Capitoline Triad.\n#Jupiter, Numa, and the Founding of Rome\nAccording to the mythologized history of the founding of Rome, Numa Pompilius, the second king of Rome, introduced Jupiter to the Romans and established the parameters of his worship. In the early days of Rome, Jupiter ruled as part of the Archaic Triad, which also included Mars and Quirinus, a deified version of the city’s founder: Romulus.\nAs the histories of Livy and Plutarch had it, Numa was facing hardship and coerced two minor deities, Picus and Faunas, into summoning Jupiter to the Aventine Hill. There, Numa consulted with the mighty god, who issued his demands regarding the offering of sacrifices, known as hostiae.\nIn exchange for securing the worship of the Roman people, Jupiter taught Numa how to avoid lightning bolts, as per Numa’s demands. Jupiter’s lightning lesson likely served as a metaphor symbolizing his broader offer of protection and support for the Roman people. Jupiter, in fact, sealed the pact with Numa and the Romans by sending down from the heavens a perfectly round shield, called the ancile, a symbol of protection if ever there were one. In turn, Numa had eleven nearly identical copies of the ancile made. These twelve shields—known collectively as the ancilia—became a sacred symbol of the city and an enduring reminder of the compact between Jupiter and Rome.\n#Jupiter and the Roman State Religion\nIn time, Jupiter worship became a part of the well-established rituals organized and overseen by the state. The Romans built a grand temple to Jupiter Optimus Maximus n the Capitoline Hill; once complete, it was the greatest of all Roman temples. According to Roman mythology, it was the legendary fifth king of Rome, Tarquinius Priscus, who began construction of the temple, and the last Roman king, Tarquinius Superbus, who finished it in 509 BC. While the temple was destroyed well before the modern era, in its time the temple towered over the Capitoline. A statue of Jupiter driving a four-horse chariot could be found at the apex of the temple. A statue of Jupiter, painted red during celebrations, and a stone altar called Iuppiter Lapis (“the Jupiter Stone”), where oath-takers took their sacred vows, both lay inside the temple.\nThe temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus served as a sacrificial site where Romans would offer slaughtered animals (known as hostiae) to the mighty god. The hostiae for Jupiter were the ox, the lamb (offered annually on the Ides of March), and the wether or castrated goat, which was offered on the Ides of January. To oversee these offerings, the Romans created the ecclesiastical position Flamen Dialis, the high priest of Jupiter. The Flamen Dialis also served as a ranking member of the college of Flamines, a body of fifteen priests who presided over the affairs of the state religion. So reverent was the office of Flamen Dialis that only those of aristocratic birth, the patricians, could occupy it (plebeians, or those of low birth, were forbidden).\nThe Temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus was also the final destination of the celebratory military processions known as triumphs. Leading such processions was a triumphator, or victorious general. The procession itself would consist of the triumphator’s army, prisoners, and spoils, which would wind through the streets of Rome before ending up at the great temple. There, the procession offered sacrifices and left a portion of their spoils for Jupiter.\nThroughout these festivities, the triumphator would bear the trappings of Jupiter himself. He would ride in a four-horse chariot, wear a purple toga, paint his face red, and even carry the scepter of Jupiter. As Maurus Servius Honoratus wrote in his Commentary on the Eclogues of Virgil, “The triumphing generals wear the insignia of Jupiter, the sceptre and toga ‘palmata,’ also known as being “in the coat of Jupiter,” while gazing with the red color of earth smeared on his face.”2 The triumphator was thought to literally embody the god as he rode toward Jupiter’s temple.\nThe Cult of Jupiter thrived in Rome from its founding, popularly dated to the eighth century BC, to at least the first century BC. The cult waned with the fall of the Republic and the rise of the Empire. During this time, the state redirected popular religious enthusiasm from the old gods to the deified Roman emperors. By the time the first emperors embraced Christianity in the fourth century CE, the mythology of Jupiter and the Roman pantheon had totally fallen out of favor.\nIn modern times, Jupiter was best known for lending his name to the fifth planet from the sun, the largest in our solar system. Readers may have also unwittingly channeled Jupiter by uttering the folksy exclamation “By Jove!” Another version of Jupiter’s name, Jove was seen as a more acceptable exclamation for pious Christians, who feared using the name of their own god in vain.\nIn most pop culture outlets, however, Zeus has been preferred to Jupiter, in keeping with the broader cultural preference for Greek deities over Roman ones."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:225ac866-f43d-4f0b-bbab-cc94397953df>","<urn:uuid:2bdc9a1a-a645-42e4-9de7-6e9cd6f82f95>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can you trace the historical evolution of the acoustic bass guitar from its inception in the 1950s to its current form? Include details about what drove its development.","answer":"The acoustic bass guitar emerged in the 1950s as a solution to the need for increased portability and accessibility in the bass domain, which was previously dominated by the bulky stand-up double bass. The development was driven by combining stringed instrument expertise with modern design principles. The result was an instrument that bridged the gap between the rich sonic presence of an upright bass and the practicality of an electric bass. The acoustic bass guitar features a hollow wooden body larger than a 6-string acoustic guitar, four strings tuned E-A-D-G (an octave below standard guitar), and provides deep, resonant tones perfect for jazz, folk, and acoustic rock performances.

{"question":"How do the feeding behaviors differ between Lesser Sand Plovers and Bar-tailed Godwits in their respective habitats, and what might this suggest about their ecological adaptations?","answer":"Lesser Sand Plovers and Bar-tailed Godwits have distinct feeding techniques. Lesser Sand Plovers use a run-and-pause technique to catch insects, crustaceans, and annelid worms, taking fewer steps and shorter pauses compared to other waders. In contrast, Bar-tailed Godwits probe in exposed mud or shallow water for crustaceans, mollusks, insects, and annelid worms on coastal mudflats. In Alaska specifically, Bar-tailed Godwits also feed heavily on aquatic insects and occasionally consume seeds and berries.","context":["Information about the Bird Lesser Sand Plover\nThe lesser sand plover is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.The flight call is a hard trill.The lesser sand plover's feeds on insects, crustaceans and annelid worms, which are obtained by a run-and-pause technique, rather than the steady probing of some other wader groups. This species takes fewer steps and shorter pauses than the greater sand plover when feeding.In all plumages, this species is very similar to the greater sand plover, Charadrius leschenaultii. Separating the species may be straightforward in mixed wintering flocks on an Indian beach, where the difference in size and structure is obvious; it is more difficult to identify a lone vagrant to western Europe, where both species are very rare. The problem is compounded in that the Middle Eastern race of greater sand plover is the most similar to the lesser. The lesser usually has darker legs, a white forehead, and a more even white wing bar than the greater.This chunky plover is long-legged and long-billed. Breeding males have grey backs and white underparts. The breast, forehead and nape are chestnut, and there is a black eye mask. The female is duller, and winter and juvenile birds lack the chestnut, apart from a hint of rufous on the head. Legs are dark and the bill black.It breeds above the tree line in the Himalayas and discontinuously across to bare coastal plains in north-eastern Siberia, with the Mongolian plover in the eastern part of the range; it has also bred in Alaska. It nests in a bare ground scrape, laying three eggs. This species is strongly migratory, wintering on sandy beaches in east Africa, south Asia and Australasia. It is a very rare vagrant in western Europe, but of the three individuals recorded in Great Britain up to 2003, one was a Mongolian plover.There are five races, and the large east Asian forms, C. m. mongolus and C. m. stegmanni, are sometimes given specific status as Mongolian plovers, Charadrius mongolus. If the taxonomic split is accepted, lesser sand plover as then defined becomes Charadrius atrifrons, including the three races atrifrons, pamirensis and schaeferi.The lesser sand plover (Charadrius mongolus) is a small wader in the plover family of birds. The spelling is commonly given as lesser sandplover, but the official British Ornithologists' Union spelling is \"lesser sand plover\". The genus name Charadrius is a Late Latin word for a yellowish bird mentioned in the fourth-century Vulgate. It derives from Ancient Greek kharadrios a bird found in ravines and river valleys (kharadra, \"ravine\"). The specific mongolus is Latin and refers to Mongolia which at the time of naming referred to a larger area than the present country.\nSize is one of the factors distinguishing a lesser sand plover from a greater sand plover, with the lesser being slightly smaller. However, it is not easy to rely on size alone especially when seen individually. The length of the bill is another distinguishing feature, with the lesser generally having a shorter bill compared to a greater. The colour of the legs in a lesser sand plover is generally darker, ranging from black to grey, while in a greater sand plover it is much paler, ranging from grey to yellowish.\nMore inforamtion about Lesser Sand Plover Facts and Photos.","Some Alaskan Bar-tailed Godwits (Limosa lapponica) have the longest non-stop flight of any migrating bird. According to some biologists, the birds stay airborne for almost one week, making a 6,800-mile beeline from wintering grounds in southeast Asia, Australia, and New Zealand to their breeding range in Alaska, Siberia and Scandinavia.\nSome routes of satellite tagged Bar-tailed Godwits migrating north from New Zealand:\nMore on this species’ identification, ecology, and conservation below the fold.\nBar-tailed Godwit is easily identifiable as a godwit by its large size and large, upturned bill. In breeding plumage, males have rich chestnut-red heads and underparts, and dark wings and upperparts touched with small amounts of chestnut. Breeding females are less colorful than males, with some light chestnut coloring on the upper breast fading to white down below. Non-breeding birds are much drabber, with grayish-brown upperparts, gray streaking on the breast, and white underparts. In its limited North American breeding range, Bar-tailed Godwit is only likely to be confused with Hudsonian Godwit, which also breeds in western Alaska. Breeding male Hudsonian Godwit, however, does not have the rich chestnut-red coloration of Bar-tailed Godwit on its head, and has a prominent white eye-line. In flight, Bar-tailed Godwit lacks the white wingbar of Hudsonian Godwit.\nOn its breeding grounds in Alaska, Bar-tailed Godwit nests on tundra hillsides with short shrubby growth and hummocky ground cover. Breeding birds will sometimes leave nesting habitat to feed at coastal lagoons located some distance away. During migration and on wintering grounds, Bar-tailed Godwit is found primarily on coastal mudflats, where it probes in exposed mud or shallow water for crustaceans, mollusks, insects, and annelid worms. In Alaska, birds feed heavily on aquatic insects, but will occasionally eat seeds and berries. Individuals do not reach sexual maturity until two years of age. Males perform elaborate courtship and territorial displays in which they call loudly and circle high above the tundra in flight. The nest is a shallow depression, lined with grass, moss, and lichens, placed on a raised hummock surrounded by grass. Clutch size is usually four eggs, and both sexes participate in incubation, which lasts about three weeks. A short time after hatching, chicks are led by both parents to marshy areas, where the young find all their own food. On migration, it is believed that Alaskan breeders fly long distances over the Pacific Ocean en route to Australia and New Zealand, rather than quickly crossing the North Pacific and then moving south along the Asian coastline.\nThe U.S. Shorebird Conservation Plan lists Bar-tailed Godwit as a “Species of High Concern,” based on its low relative abundance, threats on non-breeding grounds, and restricted U.S. breeding distribution. The breeding population of Bar-tailed Godwit in North America is concentrated in a limited area along the coastal plain of western Alaska, placing it at higher risk to potential disturbance. While Bar-tailed Godwit is protected in the United States under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act, and is also protected on its wintering grounds in New Zealand and Australia, it is not protected on the migratory pathway along the eastern coast of Asia. If Alaskan Bar-tailed Godwits do follow the Asian coastline southward more than is believed, hunting in eastern China could have a serious negative impact on the North American population of this species.\n- Gill RE, Piersma T, Hufford G, Servranckx R, Riegen A.

{"question":"What are the key differences between how Iandry Randriamandroso and Mark Bradford incorporate urban materials and community voices in their artworks?","answer":"Iandry Randriamandroso and Mark Bradford use different approaches to incorporating urban elements and community voices. Randriamandroso directly translates community interviews into visual elements, as seen in his 'Talking Hands' mural where he used American Sign Language alphabet to spell out 'BOOK THING' and represented community sentiments through hand imagery. In contrast, Bradford's work is more abstractly layered, incorporating salvaged urban materials like torn bill posters and newsprint to create abstract compositions that reference alternative cartographies of cities, including themes of economic class, immigrant communities, and race relations.","context":["Curated by Susan May\n8 April – 14 May 2011\nWhite Cube Mason's Yard\n'The dream of a suitable political work of art is in fact the dream of disrupting the relationship between the visible, the sayable, and the thinkable without having to use the terms of a message as a vehicle.' - Jacques Rancière, 'The Aesthetics of Politics' (2006)\nThe relationship between aesthetics and politics has been a polemical issue for much of the history of art. In particular, the late twentieth century saw an overt politicisation of critical discourse amidst collapsing colonial hegemonies, global wars and the emergence of civil rights movements across the world. This was coupled with artists questioning the principles of modernism opening up the debate as to what constituted a work of art. A number of key figures emerged on the international art scene, whose practice specifically dealt with issues of power structures, race, injustice, gender and dissent. The works featured in 'New Order' share a focus on the transformation of social or ideological structures that shape experience, and in different ways they explore existing communal, political and physical constructs of the everyday.\nThe formal geometry and commonplace materials of Miroslaw Balka's 'Kategorie' (2005) lend the work a pared-down aesthetic generally connected with Minimalist and Conceptual art. A six-metre long, two-metre high tunnel is interrupted by five fine coloured threads, suspended from rotating motors on the ceiling. The work is rich in associative historical and political references, such as the traumatic memory of wartime atrocities in his native Poland which Balka has addressed throughout his practice. The colours of the strands - red, violet, green, pink and black - are the colours assigned to uniforms identifying different categories of prisoner in the concentration camps (red for political prisoners; violet for Jehovah's Witnesses; green for criminals; pink for homosexual and bisexual men; and black for Romany people, alcoholics and individuals with learning disabilities, among others).\nPart of Doris Salcedo's ongoing series in which found domestic furniture is used as a vehicle to explore the traumatic political history of her native Colombia, 'Untitled' (2008) features tables and wardrobes, conjoined and partially entombed in concrete. The re-assembled components of the hybrid form of the sculpture, each through use embedded with a material history, function as silent witnesses to implied personal and collective narratives.\nRooted in black urban experience, David Hammons' practice comments on the iniquities present within social, political and economic systems. Critiquing the relationship between high art and the street, his sculptures often feature found objects laden with cultural association. Hair clippings swept from the floor of a Harlem barbershop are fashioned into a cornrow hairstyle upon a smooth oval rock in 'Rock Head' (2000), while in 'Which Mike Would You Like to Be Like?' (2001), Hammons takes three vintage microphones that serve as surrogates for three prominent figures in recent popular culture - Michael Jackson, Mike Tyson and Michael Jordan - referencing the limited range of role models for young African-American men.\nThe densely-layered, collaged paintings of Mark Bradford also incorporate materials salvaged from an urban setting, including torn bill posters or newsprint. The abstract compositions reference alternative cartographies that burgeon within cities, such as the spread of an economic underclass, the movement of immigrant communities and race relations. In 'Strange Fruit' (2011), fragments of text drawn from the local 'merchant posters' Bradford frequently uses echo across the painting, while the title is taken from the protest song about the lynching of African-Americans in the 1930s, sung by Billie Holiday.\nIn Julie Mehretu's 'Mumbo Jumbo' (2008), a swirling vortex of shapes and marks on a grey ground, overlaid with architectural passages, give the sense of a gathering storm. Made on the occasion of the inaugural New Orleans Biennial in 2008, the painting conveys the destructive power of uncontrollable nature within a stricken cityscape, mired in bureaucratic chaos.\nIn 1969, Anselm Kiefer photographed himself in a variety of imposing locations (often in settings evocative of German Romantic imagery) making the Nazi salute. The resulting series, entitled 'Besetzungen' ('Occupations'), provocatively confronted the blanking out of history and questioned the collective guilt of an entire post-war generation in Germany. In the works presented in the current exhibition, 'Heroische Sinnbilder' (2011), Kiefer revisits the iconography of his own art history, as a means of investigating the resonance of totalitarian symbols across the passage of time.\nNew Order was curated by Susan May, Creative Director, White Cube","You are here:\nArt @ Work, the five-week mural artist apprenticeship program for Baltimore City youth enrolled in the city’s Youthworks Baltimore program, employs young people ages 14-21 to work under lead teaching artists to create highly visible community artworks throughout their neighborhood.

{"question":"How do local currency crises manifest in politically volatile regions like Hong Kong, and what economic warning signs typically precede such instability?","answer":"Local currency crises occur when there's a loss of investor confidence leading to currency depreciation, which parallels concerns in Hong Kong's situation. In Hong Kong's case, while it maintains significant autonomy in financial matters, increased intervention from Beijing has raised concerns about its future stability. Economic warning signs typically include social unrest, reduced trade volumes, and currency volatility. The situation in Hong Kong shows similar patterns, with demonstrations reflecting concerns about civil liberties and economic issues, including the high cost of living and wealth divide, which could potentially impact investor confidence and trigger currency instability.","context":["What’s Happening in Hong Kong and Why?\nNSF Invited Commentary by Richard W. Mueller\nAmerican Consul General (Ambassador) to Hong Kong 1993-1996\nAugust 4, 2019\nThe following perspective on recent events in Hong Kong and China gives history and context to an important crisis, namely, Hong Kong’s future as a Special Administrative Region of China. Hong Kong’s promised 50 years of a “high degree of autonomy” within the sovereignty of the People’s Republic of China is under pressure, as described below. How the issue is resolved, or not, will have potentially large consequences for China’s credibility in its international agreements and sensitivity in handling difficult issues as well as for Hong Kong’s significant world role in trade, finance, and economic development. Also, at stake are the civil liberties, human rights, and lives of the Hong Kong people.\nThe View From a Hong Kong Perspective:\n– Hong Kong (HK) was promised a “high degree of autonomy” after its return to China in 1997, particularly in civil liberties and freedoms, rule of law, travel/ trade/investment, participation in international organizations. Defense and foreign affairs were reserved to the national government.\n– HK has continued to prosper since its return to China. But more recently the central government has intervened more often, e.g., when it attacked the press and others for criticizing the Communist Party or when it forcibly removed HK residents to the mainland for detention/trial.\n– Many Hong Kong people, particularly the younger generation born after 1997, have chafed under Beijing’s demands for patriotic education in schools, security legislation, and patriotic obeisance. The umbrella movement of 2014 drew widespread support in HK. The current generation feels itself to be unique “Hong Kongers,” different from mainland Chinese.\n– Few Hong Kongers advocate independence. Universal suffrage was in the cards but not full democracy. HK wants more freedom to openly choose its leaders and more restraint from China.\n– The spark that started the current prairie fire, to use a Mao Zedong phrase, was a government proposal for extradition to China. Interestingly, many professional HK civil servants now are speaking out. The demands of the demonstrators vary: permanent withdrawal of the extradition legislation; discipline of the police for excessive use of force; action to deal with the high cost of living and enormous wealth divide; concessions from Carrie Lam, HK chief executive, including a more sustained dialogue with different societal groups; importantly, more restraint from Beijing.\nThe View from a Beijing Perspective:\n– Hong Kong is fully a part of China. The one-country/two systems policy is China’s alone to implement. Interference from any other country is interference in China’s internal affairs.\n– Criticism of the Communist Party and China’s leaders is a red line not to be crossed.\n– Demonstrations reflect poorly on China which has helped to take care of HK and allowed its people to invest and travel/live in China and to again be part of the great Chinese people.\n– The HK chief executive must tamp down the demonstrations. The HK police must steel themselves and deal forcefully with demonstrators as necessary.\n– Beijing has launched a high visibility propaganda offensive. The US is the “black hand” behind the demonstrators trying to separate HK from China. Combined with the US-launched “tariff war,” America is the “shit-stirring stick” interfering in China’s business.\n– The PLA has troops in HK that could attempt to suppress unrest. Beijing will be extremely reluctant to take this course since the outcome would likely involve bloodshed, shatter the current one country/two systems constitutional structure, undermine economic development in China and draw deep criticism from around the world.\n– Any such use of PRC force would further alienate Taiwan and set back China’s strategic goal of reuniting it with the “motherland.”\n– However, Beijing would not hesitate to launch such an intervention and bear the attendant costs if it felt it had no other choice to deal with threats to China’s unity.\nThe View From a Washington Perspective:\n– The US has long-standing ties with Hong Kong. By enacting the Hong Kong Policy Act in 1992 the US, at China’s request, recognized China’s one country/two systems structure allowing HK to maintain a system different from the rest of the PRC. The US supports HK as an engine for international trade/investment and a beacon for civil liberties and human rights.\n– The US continues to support HK’s promised “high degree of autonomy.” Protests and demonstrations are solely those of Hong Kong people. The US stands for non-violence.\n– The Trump administration has commented little on Hong Kong. It avoids statements that might divert attention from the issue of the “tariff war.” It downplayed the outgoing American Consul General’s recent final speech on US – HK relations, an insightful statement of American interest in a productive relationship with Hong Kong and China.\n– More broadly, the administration correctly identifies unacceptable and harmful Chinese policies and practices and points to the authoritarian nature of Chinese leadership and the Communist Party.\n– There is little discussion of how a constructive relationship benefits both countries.\n– The administration has adopted a broadly confrontational approach to China without any cogent, strategic sense of what the relationship should or could look like over coming years and how to work toward it. For example, it suggests the US needs to de-couple its economy from China’s and create a “whole of society” resistance to China. Some people talk about a new “cold war.”\n– The administration’s approach will not serve HK or the US well. If China concludes the US or anyone else is trying to separate HK and Taiwan from China, it will act forcefully and even militarily.\n– Americans need to identify our national interests clearly and how best to realize them. Do those interests include a broad, uncharted, and dangerous confrontation with China that could even lead to armed conflict?\n– Or is there a wiser path of “tough diplomacy” and realistic policies that would better serve US long-term interests of peaceful development and engagement with the rest of the world?\nRichard W. Mueller was a 32-year career Foreign Service Officer, Minister-Counselor, retiring in 1998 after serving as American Consul General (Chief of Mission) in Hong Kong, 1993-1996. He previously served as Deputy Executive Secretary under Secretary of State George Schultz and Deputy Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs under Secretary James Baker. He specialized in Asian and Chinese affairs, serving in State Department positions as well as in Beijing, Hong Kong, Taiwan, two assignments at the American Embassy in Saigon, and Canberra. He subsequently served as Director of the Asia Society Hong Kong Center and then for fifteen years was Head of School of three schools, Northfield Mount Hermon School in Massachusetts, Hong Kong International School, and Shanghai American School. He currently serves as a trustee of Chinese American International School in San Francisco and is an affiliate of the Center for China-U.S. Cooperation of Denver University’s Korbel School of International Studies. Richard and his wife, Claire, currently reside in Golden, Colorado.","What is Economic Collapse?\nEconomic collapse refers to a period of national or regional economic breakdown where the economy is in distress for a long period, which can range from a few years to several decades. During periods of economic distress, a country is characterized by social chaos, social unrest, bankruptcies, reduced trade volumes, currency volatility, and breakdown of law and order.\nDue to the magnitude of the economic distress, government interventions for economic recovery can be slow to bring the economy back on track, and the delay causes even greater disorganization of the economy.\nCauses of Economic Collapse\nThe following are some of the causes of economic collapse:\nHyperinflation occurs when the government allows inflationary pressure to build up in the economy by printing excessive money, which leads to a gradual rise in the prices of commodities and services. Governments resort to creating excess money and credit with the goal of managing an economic slowdown. Hyperinflation occurs when the government loses control of the price increases and raises the interest rates as a way of managing the accelerating inflation.\nStagflation refers to a situation in which the economy is growing at a slow rate while simultaneously experiencing high rates of inflation. Such an economic situation causes a dilemma among policymakers since the measures implemented to reduce the rise in inflation may increase unemployment levels to abnormally high levels. Stagflations and its effects on the economy may last for several years or decades.\nFor example, the United States experienced stagflation from the 1960s to the 1970s. During said period, economic growth was stagnant, and the inflation peaked at 13% per annum while the inflation rate in the United Kingdom was at 20% per annum. Once stagflation occurs, it is usually difficult to manage, and governments must incur huge costs to bring balance to the economy.\n3. Stock market crash\nA stock market crash occurs when there is a loss of investor confidence in the market, and there is a dramatic decline in stock prices across different stocks trading in the stock market. When a stock market crash occurs, it creates a bear market (when prices drop 20% or more from their highs to hit new lows), and it drains capital out of businesses.\nCrashes occur when there is a prolonged period of rising stock prices, price earning ratios exceed long-term averages, and there is excessive use of margin debt by market participants.\nScenarios that Define an Economic Collapse\nThe following are some of the things that characterize an economic collapse:\n1. Rising interest rates\nDuring periods of economic collapse, interest rates peak at abnormally high levels, and it limits the amount of money that is available for investors to invest. High interest rates hinder economic growth since investors, corporations, and the government find it costly to service existing debt obligations and take out new loans due to the high cost of capital.\nWhen a major company declares its inability to finance its debt obligations and resorts to disposing of its assets to pay creditors, investors lose confidence in the company and will be hesitant to trade their money during periods of financial distress.\n2. Sovereign debt crisis\nSovereign debts are debts taken up by a government to finance capital-intensive infrastructural projects. However, when the government takes on too many debts and is unable to pay principal and interest obligations when they fall due, it increases the risk of defaulting on its existing debt obligations and becoming bankrupt.\nA sovereign debt crisis occurs during periods of slow economic growth, wars, political instability, drought, and when investors lose confidence in the government. Due to the large size of sovereign debts, a default by the government is likely to affect the global economy and cause spill-over effects on other jurisdictions.\n3. Local currency crisis\nA local currency crisis occurs when the currency depreciates in value due to a loss of investor confidence. This occurs when foreign investors who have invested in a country and advanced credit to the government lose confidence in the government’s ability to meet debt obligations or generate the agreed-upon returns.\nIn such situations, the foreign investors withdraw their investments in the country. The move increases the selling of the borrowing country’s currency in the international market, resulting in currency devaluation. In return, the currency devaluation increases the country’s international debts, resulting in the loss of the country’s purchasing power.\n4. Global currency crisis\nA global currency crisis involves the loss of value of a major currency that is used in cross-border trade transactions between individuals, corporations, and governments. For example, the US dollar is used as the world reserve currency in the Bretton Woods institutions, which means that if the US dollar depreciates in value, it may trigger a global economic crisis.\nCFI offers the Financial Modeling & Valuation Analyst (FMVA)™ certification program for those looking to take their careers to the next level.

{"question":"How do conventional breeding and modern biotechnology approaches compare in addressing food security challenges in developing regions like Sub-Saharan Africa?","answer":"Conventional breeding programs for crop improvement face significant limitations - they are time-consuming and can be hampered by lack of useful germplasms (genetic material). In contrast, modern biotechnology approaches like CRISPR offer more rapid and precise ways to develop improved crop varieties. For example, CRISPR is being used to create virus-resistant bananas and disease-resistant maize in Africa. The combination of classical breeding with modern biotechnology tools enables development of climate-smart cultivars with enhanced traits like salinity tolerance, early maturity, and improved nutrient content - characteristics particularly valuable for hunger-prone regions affected by extreme weather. This comprehensive approach helps address food security challenges more effectively than conventional breeding alone.","context":["Pollination is a natural way to deliver DNA into plant cells. So why not to use pollen as a vehicle for CRISPR machinery to start genome editing? HI Edit, as this approach is called, has been successfully tested by Syngenta in corn, Arabidopsis and wheat in the lab. Please see the paper just published in Nature Biotechnology by Timothy Kelliher et al., Jon Cohen’s piece in Science, and a quick guide to HI (haploid induction) from Current Biology. Leading wheat geneticist Cristobal Uauy of the John Innes Centre also showed high spirit, when asked for comment by email: “The possibility to genome edit any variety is revolutionary given that transformation is so difficult in many species. If I understand this correctly this would be a game changer as it would allow us to alter genes in elite cultivars.”\nResearchers from the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture in Nairobi, Kenya, are using CRISPR to inactivate the banana streak virus DNA in the genome of plantain. Their strategy, reported in Communications Biology today, paves the way for improving banana breeding and getting better varieties of this staple food crop. This project is a welcome addition to the list of CRISPR applications being considered for developing countries’ agriculture, such as maize varieties resistant to lethal necrosis and cassava resistant to brown streak disease.\nChili peppers have happily entered our kitchens with their capsaicinoid content, since Cristoforo Colombo brought then back from Central America. Capsicum species however are labour-intensive and difficult to grow. They are also notoriously recalcitrant to biotechnological intervention. Tomatoes are much handier in comparison.

Quantity and quality of crop yields are falling due to influences from these factors. The combined impacts of these factors invariably lead to poor access to nutrient-rich foods, severe hunger and massive increases in the prevalence and number of people living with protein-calorie malnutrition or vitamin-mineral deficiencies (VMD) in sub-Sahara Africa (SSA) and some parts of Asia. So far nearly 2 billion people in these regions are malnourished while 1 billion others suffer severe hunger. Classical strategies of crop improvement through conventional breeding programs for higher crop yields, nutrients enrichment, resistance to pests, diseases and other environmental stressors; or for improved water and fertilizer use efficiency are time consuming. Lack of useful genotypes (germplasms) also hampers the effective use of conventional approaches for crop improvement. Against this backdrop, availing growers with improved crop varieties requires a huge time lag. Overcoming these challenges will necessarily require a comprehensive approach involving combining classical breeding, with modern frontier agricultural technologies. Agricultural technologies such as immunization and biotechnology (genetic engineering) have strong potentials towards contributing to the development of healthier, higher yielding GM seeds, climate smart cultivars with capacity to endure salinity, soil reactions and disease, as well as transgenic varieties dense in essential nutrients and presenting improved appearances compliant with mechanization. Above all such GM varieties genetically equipped for early maturity are in all wise welcome especially in hunger prone, highly malnourished conflict ridden and extreme weather affected localities including sub-Saharan Africa. In the light of these therefore, this article reviewed the significance of biotechnology on crop improvement, human nutrition and health using available literature published between 1987-2018; and the outcomes of the review are hereby presented and discussed.\nE-mail: enyidave2003@ gmail.com\nBiotechnology; Immunization, Hybridization; GM crops; Food Security; Malnutrition.\nPost-Publication Peer-review Rundown\nView/get involved, click [Peer-review]\nAbah, A.

{"question":"How effective are green roofs at managing rainfall runoff compared to traditional roofs?","answer":"According to data from green roof specialist Baulder, green roofs are highly effective at managing rainfall runoff. Extensive roofs with 20-40mm of substrate can retain 40% of average rainfall, while intensive roofs with 500mm of substrate can store up to 90% of average rainfall. This water retention helps mimic natural runoff patterns by allowing rainfall to be absorbed by vegetation or lost through evaporation, reducing the load on below-ground drainage systems and allowing for smaller attenuation features on the ground.","context":["When most people think of drainage they think of pipes in the ground, however, today we are looking at a drainage system that can be installed on your roof.\nWelcome to our next instalment of our deep dive into the world of Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) where this week we are heading to the top of your development and looking at how green roofs can be used as part of your drainage system.\nSo what is a green roof?\nA green roof is simply a roof that has been partially or fully covered by vegetation and is sometime also referred to as a living roof. They sit right at the top of the hierarchy meaning that they not only provide attenuation from a drainage point of view but also improve water quality, promote biodiversity and provide opportunities to create amenity spaces.\nThere are predominantly two types of systems and which one you go for really depends on your project and access requirements. They can either be:\n- Extensive Roofs – These are specified when access to the roof is not important. They are relatively lightweight as a result of low substrate depths and generally incorporate low maintenance planting which is fairly wind, drought and frost resilient.\n- Intensive Roofs – Also known as roof gardens these can be used where there is a requirement for the roof to be used as a recreational space. They have a much deeper growing medium which can accommodate a more complex landscape strategy however, as a result they do usually require more maintenance than a traditional roof.\nFigure 1: Example of Extensive (Left) and Intensive (Right) green roofs\nSource: CIRIA SuDS Manual Version 6 (C753)\nWhere can they be used?\nBasically, if your development has a roof there is an opportunity to make it green. It does not matter if your project is large or small, residential or commercial a green roof can provide the opportunity of bringing a range of benefits to your project.\nSome of my favourite applications of green roofs are in the educational sector where intensive roofs can be used to create outdoor learning areas and provide opportunities to reconnect children with nature.\nA brilliant example of this is the installation of a green roof by Sheffield City Council at Sharrow Primary School. The project involved the design and construction of a new 2000m2 green roof which created play space as well as outdoor classrooms. It was also the first green roof in the country to be declared a nature reserve. Further information on the project can be found at the link below.\nFigure 2: Green roof at Sharrow Primary School, Sheffield\nSo what are the benefits in terms of drainage?\nGreen roofs help to mimic the natural runoff profile by allowing some of the rainfall to be taken up by the vegetation or through evaporation meaning that less of it needs to be accommodated in your below ground drainage system.\nData released by Baulder who are a green roof specialist state that extensive roofs with a 20-40mm of substrate can retain 40% of average rainfall while for intensive roofs with 500mm of substrate has the capability of storing up to 90% of the average rainfall.\nThis means that attenuation features on the ground can be smaller requiring less excavation and leaving more space for other services.\nAre there any other advantages?\nThere are many advantages of using green roofs on your development, with some of the main ones being:\n- No additional land take as the attenuation requirement is being provided through what would traditionally be an underutilised asset.\n- Improvement of air quality as the vegetation can help to filter out both dust particles and gas pollutants.\n- Can insulate the building against extremes in temperatures leading to a reduction in heating costs in the winter and cooling costs in the summer.\n- Can be used to absorb sound so could be particularly beneficial adjacent to airports, motorways, etc.\nThis all sounds too good to be true? What are the downsides?\n- Green roofs generally cost more than conventional roofs due to the increased structural requirements, this can be offset however by some of the additional benefits they can provide.\n- For intensive roofs there can be an increased requirement for maintenance.\n- As the roof is designed to store water it means that any damage to the membrane could be more critical.\nGreen roofs are a fantastic way of utilising what would be dead space to help meet your attenuation requirements. They can bring a raft of benefits to your project and enhance your outdoor space creating opportunities for people to interact more with nature.\nIf you want to know more why not check out some of the links included within this article or get in touch where we will be happy to advise on how a green roof might benefit your project."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:66f5c307-0e60-4716-b524-2b3bd7dd991e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Do private vs public insurance plans have different mental health parity requirements?","answer":"Private health plans, including self-funded, fully funded, and individual plans bought on or off the exchange, must comply with the Mental Health Parity law requiring equal coverage between mental health and medical benefits. For public insurance, most Medicaid programs must comply with parity requirements, while Medicare is not subject to the federal parity law. The parity law specifically applies to employer-sponsored health coverage for companies with 50+ employees, coverage purchased through health insurance exchanges, and the Children's Health Insurance Program.","context":["Mental health therapy is expensive, no doubt about it, you can dial any mental health therapy institution and just ask for the price for a single session, you won’t be surprised, it is going to be expensive. The price goes up with the severity of the problem you are encountering, and not just because of the number of the sessions needed, but also because of the degree of expertise the therapist has to have to treat you, and because of the price of the medications you will be prescribed. Good thing is that mental health therapy is becoming more affordable just like life insurance, health insurance, car insurance, and can be covered by your health insurance – check here!\nIn 2008 the Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act law has passed (more commonly known as the Mental Health Parity law or Federal Parity Law). What does this mean? The law requires coverage of services for mental health, behavioral health, and substance-use disorders to be comparable to physical health coverage, meaning you are now eligible for mental health therapy covered by your health insurance! This act requires that all companies that offer health insurance will treat mental health disorders and substance use disorders just as any medical or surgical coverage. It means that they won’t be able to charge more copay than they charge for most medical or surgical office visits, nor will they be able to limit the number of mental health visits, as they did in the past.\nThe federal parity law is specific and applies to certain types of health insurance:\n– Employer-sponsored health coverage – for companies with 50 or more employees.\n– Coverage purchased through health insurance exchanges.\n– Children’s Health Insurance Program.\n– Most Medicaid programs (can vary from program to program; contact your state Medicaid director for more info). Don’t confuse it with Medicare, because it is not subject to the federal parity law!).\nBy now you are surely interested if your health insurance plan is covering mental health or substance use disorder services in parity with medical or surgical benefits? If you are a part of a large employer plan, you are probably subject to the parity protections required under Mental Health Parity law. However, for any further questions, you should take a look at your plan’s enrolment material to check your coverage level for any benefits. Contact your medical insurance agent, by the same act they are obliged to provide you with an easy to understand summary about your benefits regarding your mental health coverage, as well as your medical or surgical coverage. Or if you are a part of a large company insurance plan, check with your human resources department, they will help you with any question you have in detail!\nThis, however, does not mean that the parity law states that you have to have mental health benefits, it just clearly states that the mental health benefits offered cannot have more restrictive requirements than those applied to physical health benefits, meaning you won’t pay more for mental health benefits than you pay for physical health benefits. This also applies to copay, meaning you won’t pay more copay than for any medical or surgical service offered!\nEven if you already have mental health coverage, your mental health provider can still refuse to accept your insurance, so don’t be surprised if this happens. This is because many insurance companies have not increased the reimbursement rate for the last 10 or 20 years, and because of the high administrative costs for running a practice, a lot of mental health professionals have chosen not to participate in the network. If this is your case, and your insurance is provided through your employee, try talking to human resources, they might take you in consideration when planning your insurance in the future negotiations with the insurance companies.\nIn case none of the above applies as a solution to your problem, try considering other option, because there are other options, and they can just be the solution you are looking for:\n- Talk to your insurance agent – there are insurance plans that can offer you a list of professionals that specialize in the issue you are looking for help for, and you might only have to pay a small portion for the service. You should also check of your coverage doesn’t cover therapy; it just might cover social worker or psychologist assistance.\n- Community mental health center – it can either free or low costs and are covered by Medicaid insurance.\n- Support groups – most of these groups are free and are led by professional volunteers.\n- Training clinic – typically located on universities, these clinics are run by students as part of their training program and are always supervised by professional psychologists and mental health therapists with highest profiles.\n- Books, podcasts, and videos – written and made by mental health professionals, these materials have been shown as a great way to help yourself.\n- Online therapy – this method of therapy is a lot more affordable than conventional therapy and can costs 4-5 times less, and you can expect the same results. It is usually applied for less severe mental health problems, such as anxiety, mild depression, work-related mental issues, substance abuse disorder, or relationship/marriage problems. The options using this method are countless, from group therapy to telephone therapy, to e-mail therapy!\nIf you are struggling with a chronic, severe mental illness that incapacitates you from doing your job, you are probably eligible for disability benefits. This option should be your last refuge because not only the process for applying is long and complicated, but it does not necessarily mean you will get health insurance. It means that after receiving disability benefits you will become eligible for Medicare, and if disabled, you are also eligible for Medicaid, together with the mental health benefits provided by both.\nWhatever you are struggling with, ask for help, either from your insurance agent, or look for advice from some online clinic. The solution to your problem is out there somewhere, take time, and inform yourself, and you will find a solution.","Laws which Offer autism and Mental Health Protections to Consumers\nWHAT IS THE FEDERAL MENTAL HEALTH PARITY AND ADDICTION EQUITY ACT?\nThe Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 (MHPAEA), is a federal law that was enacted in order to address health insurance practices that unfairly limited coverage for mental illness and substance abuse. Generally, the law requires that if plans offer mental health benefits, the financial requirements and treatment limitations for mental health or substance use can be no more restrictive than the predominant financial requirements or treatment limitations applied to substantially all medical and surgical benefits covered by the plan and there are no separate treatment limitations that are applicable only with respect to mental health or substance use disorder benefits.\nThe law applies to nearly all private health plans, including those that are self-funded, fully funded, and individual plans bought on or off the exchange. The law extended to the individual and small group market through the Affordable Care Act. The law does not apply to:\nIn 2016, a Federal Mental Health Parity Task Force issued a report to President Obama which included many recommendations on implementation and enforcement of the Federal Mental Health Parity Act. One of the recommendations included tracking consumer complaints related to mental health and substance abuse. The Kennedy Forum has taken the initiative to track this information and share it with legislators and policy makers. If you (or a loved one or a client) have been denied a mental health treatment, please consider reporting your experiences here.\n1. Benefit Classifications: All health care benefits are categorized into six benefit classifications. Services for MH/SUD must be at parity with medical/surgical benefits in each of these categories:\nFor example, if a plan requires prior authorization requirements for behavior treatment for autism, or intensive outpatient therapy for mental health, they must require pre-authorization requirements for substantially all medical/surgical treatments.\n2. Consumer Cost-Sharing and Treatment Limitations: Consumer cost-sharing such as co-pays, deductibles or co-insurance and treatment limitations cannot be more restrictive or burdensome for MH/SUD than for medical or surgical benefits.\nFor example, if a health plan allows unlimited outpatient medical visits per year, it cannot limit MH/SUD outpatient visits to a specified amount.\n3. Nonquantitative Treatment Limitations: NQTLs applied to MH/SUD can be no more restrictive than treatment limitations applied to substantially all medical and surgical benefits covered by the plan and there are no separate treatment limitations that are applicable only with respect to mental health or substance use disorder benefits.\nSome examples of NQTLs may be found here , and include:\nFor example, a plan cannot exclude coverage for inpatient, out-of-network treatment of substance abuse disorders when obtained outside of the State, if there is no similar exclusion for medical or surgical benefits within the same classification. Similarly, a plan cannot require Joint Commission Accreditation for Mental Health Facilities but not for medical facilities within the same class.\nAn example of Fail-first/step therapy protocols that we see frequently are denials for residential treatment if clients have not previously tried partial hospital or intensive outpatient. Plans cannot do that if they do not make similar requirements on the medical/surgical side.\nThe law also states that there are no separate treatment limitations that are applicable only to MH or SUD benefits. Examples of these that we see all the time are exclusions for specific types of evidence based mental health treatments that do not have direct analogs on the medical/surgical side, including:\n4. Transparency of Health Plan Information: For any denial of service, the plan must include in writing the reason for the denial (if it is not medically necessary, the plan must say why), and steps on how to appeal. They also must make available to you criteria used in making their decision.\n5. Out-of-Network Benefits: Access to out-of-network MH/SUD services cannot be more difficult or restrictive than it is for medical or surgical services.\nAs of this writing, all states have meaningful legislation or regulation that requires funding for autism treatments. Nearly all address behavioral therapy, and some include requirements around speech, occupational and physical therapies as well. Not all autism laws are the same, and it is important to understand the law governing your state. For a list of autism laws by state and what they cover, click here.\nThe Kennedy Forum offers a state by state analysis of mental health parity legislation and regulation. To see what protections are available by state, click here. Don’t be too discouraged if your state got an F, as they are in good company. It is more important to understand the protections offered.\nIn California, there is a law in place called AB 88, also known as the California Mental Health Parity Act of 2000. This law requires coverage for the diagnosis and medically necessary treatment of the following \"severe mental illnesses\" in parity with other medical conditions:\nCalifornia’s active autism mandate, AB 796, can be found here.\nIt has no restrictions on age, or caps on visits or annual spending. Unfortunately, this state mandate does not apply to Medi-Cal. Children on Medi-Cal are able to access ABA services through interpretation of federal Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) law. Effective 2014, services were available to those with autism, under age 21. Effective 2018, services were expanded to include other conditions, when medically necessary and recommended by a physician or a psychologist. At this time, these services are only available for those under age 21.\nThe SED qualification can be used for children who do not have a formal \"severe mental illness\" diagnosis or ASD diagnosis, but are experiencing many similar challenges to justify the need for behavior treatment, residential treatment, or other intensive type treatment.\nIt is important to note that the CA Mental Health Parity Act entitles you to a diagnostic evaluation if there is a suspicion of any of the above listed conditions. Your primary care provider can authorize this. The plan is still responsible for this evaluation even if the child is later found not to have any of the above listed conditions.\nIt is also important to know that due to significant litigation (Harlick v Blue Shield of CA and Rea vs Blue Shield of CA), the CA parity act requires that all medically necessary treatment be provided to those that meet its criteria. This argument has been used to prevent health plans from enforcing categorical denials for things like wilderness therapy, residential treatment, and other evidence based treatments for autism/mental health conditions.\nBoth Massachusetts and NY have laws which require that the health plan or insurance company make a determination within required timelines for both expedited and standard appeals. Failure to adhere to the timelines shall be deemed to be a reversal of the health plan’s adverse determination. Laws in both states apply to fully funded plans.\nThe state of Oregon has a law which allows the Director of the Department of Consumer and Business Services to seek restitution on a consumer’s behalf for the actual damages the consumer suffered as a result of the insurer’s violation of state or federal law, or breach of contract."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:540e383a-7b28-4518-a0e8-89254a7e1f44>","<urn:uuid:ce381ba1-c141-4f04-b2c2-69f3c31025bc>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the structural and electronic properties of the H3+ ion that make it unique in interstellar space?","answer":"H3+ is a triangular-shaped triatomic hydrogen ion that consists of three hydrogen atoms sharing only two electrons (instead of three), giving it a plus-one positive charge. It is the most prevalent molecular ion in interstellar space and has the ability to vibrate in various ways when excited. This structure allows it to emit photons during de-excitation, which can be detected by radio telescopes.","context":["The molecule known as H3+ is believed to have had a vital role in cooling down the first stars of the universe, and may still play an important part in the formation of current stars. The unassuming molecule known as a triatomic hydrogen ion, or H3+, may hold secrets of the formation of the first stars after the Big Bang.\n\"Most of the universe consists of hydrogen in various forms,\" said Ludwik Adamowicz, a professor in the University of Arizona''s department of chemistry and biochemistry, but the H3+ ion is the most prevalent molecular ion in interstellar space. It's also one of the most important molecules in existence.\"\nBelieved to be critical to the formation of stars in the early days of the universe, H3+ also is the precursor to many types of chemical reactions, said Adamowicz, including those leading to compounds such as water or carbon, which are essential for life.\nEarly stars would have become hotter and hotter until they exploded before they ever formed, according to Michele Pavanello, who led the groundbreaking research, unless there was a way to release some of that pent-up energy.\n\"There wouldn't be any star formation if there weren't molecules that slowly cool down the forming star by emitting light,\" said Pavanello. Not many molecules can do that, he added, partly because very few molecules existed in the early days of the universe. \"Astronomers think that the only molecule that could cool down a forming star in that particular time is H3+.\"\nAnother molecule, molecular hydrogen, would have been present, but it would have had a much harder time cooling a forming star than H3+. \"Hydrogen does not like to emit light, while H3+ can bend and vibrate, and in doing so it is able to emit light.\" said Pavanello.\nH3+ is an electrically charged molecule, called an ion. It consists of three hydrogen atoms with only two, as opposed to a healthy three, electrons to share between them. Lacking a negatively charged electron, the molecule takes on a plus-one positive charge.\nH3+ has a triangular shape, explained Adamowicz. \"As it is excited it starts to vibrate in various ways.\"\n\"One has to involve a large amount of computations at the quantum mechanical level to predict those vibrations,\" said Adamowicz. \"The role of theory is essentially to simulate those vibrations in the computer and then describe how the molecule is swinging or dancing.\"\nUnderstanding the various vibrations of H3+ could help astronomers deduce to what extent it played a role in the formation of the early stars.\n\"In the 1990s, H3+ was observed surrounding stars,\" said Adamowicz. \"The stars emit radiation, which not only contributes to the production of H3+ but also excites the molecule to higher energy states. The molecule can also become excited through leftover energy from chemical reactions it was involved in or through collisions with other molecules. In the process of de-excitation the molecule emits photons that are detected by our radio telescopes.\"\n\"That can only happen with H3+ because molecular hydrogen is too symmetric,\" said Pavanello. \"And so H3+ has a very important cooling function in the formation of the first stars after the Big Bang.\"\n\"The only way we can predict how the stars form is if we know very well what the cooling abilities of H3+ are, and we cannot know its cooling ability until we know its vibrational spectrum. We need to know what these energy levels are,\" said Pavanello.\n\"With this paper we have pinpointed the energy levels up to a certain energy threshold that is already good enough to generate accurate predictions of the cooling ability of H3+,\" said Pavanello.\nThe group didn't set out to unlock the secrets of H3+, said Pavanello, who graduated from the UA in 2010 with a prestigious Marie Curie post-doctoral fellowship that took him to Leiden University in the Netherlands. He is now an assistant professor of theoretical chemistry at Rutgers University.\n\"It all happened almost by chance,\" he said. \"A friend of the mass-spectrometry facility in the UA's chemistry department happens to be a very good quantum chemist from Hungary. He once visited the department and talked to Ludwik about the possibility to do some H3+ calculations. At the time, I had just started. The code I was writing was almost done, and we thought H3+ could be a good system on which to test this code.\"\nThe researchers input a computer code into super computers at the UA's High Performance Computing Center that described the ways in which H3+ vibrates according to quantum mechanical principles. \"We couldn't have done this without their support,\" said Pavanello.\nDepending on the level of approximations made in the computer code, said Pavanello, the researchers can develop software that can describe the motion of small molecules very well, or large molecules very approximately.\n\"We decided to implement something that had essentially no approximations, but of course with the price that we can only apply it to very small molecules,\" said Pavanello. \"Our method simply did not exist before in a mainstream form.\"\nThe UA team's results were corroborated by teams from Hungary, France, London and Russia, and also by experiments done at the Max-Planck Institute in Heidelberg, Germany that created H3+ in a laboratory and verified that its spectral lines matched the predictions.\nThe UA team's contribution allowed the researchers for the first time to assign spectral lines of H3+ to particular types of the vibrational motions as the ion releases photons with near-visible wavelengths. These wavelengths contribute to the color of the light H3+ radiates toward us from interstellar space.\n\"If you point a telescope to the sky, you see spectral lines that are very specific to a certain molecule or atom,\" said Pavanello. Different molecules emit photons at different wavelengths, which result in different spectral lines that allow astronomers to determine the chemical composition of stars. But the more these telescopes get accurate and precise, the more spectral lines we see.\"\n\"We are at a point in which we see many, many more spectral lines than we can possibly identify, and we don't know what these lines mean,\" said Pavanello.\nKnowing the vibrational levels, and therefore the spectral lines of H3+, will allow astronomers and astro-chemists to sift through the inundation of spectral lines and further identify the elemental composition of objects in space.\nIt also allows scientists to predict the cooling abilities of H3+, and generate a possible scenario for how the first generation stars formed after the Big Bang, said Pavanello. \"We now have an important piece of the puzzle needed to embark on reliable modeling of the formation of the first stars.\"\nThese groundbreaking results have been published in a recent edition of Physical Review Letters.\nThe image at the top of the page was taken during Hubble's 100,000th orbit around the Earth when it peered into a small portion of the nebula near the star cluster NGC 2074 (upper, left).

It lies about 170 000 light-years away near the Tarantula nebula, one of the most active star-forming regions in our Local Group of galaxies.\nThe three-dimensional-looking image reveals dramatic ridges and valleys of dust, serpent-head \"pillars of creation\", and gaseous filaments glowing fiercely under torrential ultraviolet radiation.

{"question":"What tool was used to determine geographic coordinates for maps, and how did it work?","answer":"The online Bounding Box tool was used to determine geographic coordinates. The process involved drawing the outline of the boundaries on the Bounding Box tool, and then copying and pasting the coordinates (already properly formatted) directly into the catalog record.","context":["As I wrap up cataloging the last few maps and polishing the last blog post for this phase of Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR)-funded map cataloging for BHS, the time has come to let everyone know what we have accomplished in the last 17 months.\nThe purpose of a CLIR Hidden Collections grant is to ‘uncover’ ‘hidden’ collections, by making previously uncataloged collections available for discovery on the Web. For libraries, this goal is achieved by the creation of MARC (machine-readable catalog) records for each item in the collection for inclusion in local and international online library holdings catalogs. As libraries face an increasingly digital future, it has become highly desirable to expand these records to include more detailed machine-readable data to be ready for use by future online systems, some barely imagined yet. For map cataloging, this means creating and including formatted GIS information.\nThe ‘hidden collection’ for this phase of the grant project was the 20th century map collection. Since August 2013, records for more than 470 maps and 35 atlases owned by BHS have been added to Bobcat, the online catalog hosted by New York University. Our holdings are also included in the OCLC catalog, and are accessible through Worldcat. Not only have we made these holdings known, but we have enhanced the catalog records wherever possible by including detailed information usually not recorded in a catalog record to increase the likelihood these maps be discovered by those searching for such information. The rich detail of these enhanced records also makes it possible for a researcher to more reasonably assess whether a particular map will meet their needs.\nTo see a typical record enhancement, I’ll use the “Nester’s Brooklyn Maps” record in Bobcat as an example. The view shown below—which can be found by clicking ‘more bibliographic information’ in the Bobcat record display—reveals the expanded and detailed content note for the map, along with a note describing content found on the verso. These notes almost always include the phrase ‘covers’ to give a clear geographic description, and ‘shows’ to indicate what kind of information might be found on the map. These note fields are searchable in the catalog by keyword search, so anyone wondering about Brooklyn automobile routes in the 1970’s will find this map as long as they use the keyword search box–usually the default search in Bobcat. In addition, these details, if considered important, are also reflected in the subject headings assigned to the map and so become links in the record display. This map will collate with other maps with the subject heading ‘Streets — New York (State) — New York — Maps’ or ‘Downtown Brooklyn – Maps.’ In this way, this descriptive catalog record makes discoverable more features about the maps, while providing additional information with which to evaluate its content.\nWhile borough-wide and city-wide maps are enhanced with attention to important details on the maps, maps covering smaller portions of Brooklyn have been analyzed by neighborhood. Below is a view of the “Borough of Brooklyn 52nd Assembly District, 1971” map record. In this instance, it is evident the cataloger took pains to identify all seven neighborhoods through which this meandering strip of a district made its way from the Sunset Park to the Fort Greene neighborhoods of Brooklyn.\nThese neighborhoods are documented in notes, in subject headings, and in machine-readable code found in the 052 field (see the ‘MARC tags view’ below). This identification of neighborhoods, painstakingly undertaken with Kenneth Jackson’s Neighborhoods of Brooklyn (1998) in hand, has proven to be a valuable enhancement for researchers here at BHS, who often seek information for specific neighborhoods.\nFinally, as part of the CLIR project, we have enhanced catalog records by including geographic coordinates indicating the coverage of each map whenever possible. To return to “Nester’s Map of Brooklyn,” this time on the MARC tags view shown below, scale and coordinate statements are recorded in machine readable and normal formats in the 034 and 255 fields, respectively. Many maps do not include geographic coordinate information, and it was necessary to determine the boundaries for each map on a case by case basis and put the information into the catalog manually. For this work, the online Bounding Box tool was invaluable, for it made the process as simple as drawing the outline of the boundaries on the Bounding Box tool, and then copying and pasting the coordinates (already properly formatted) right into the catalog record. We were able to include this information as we created new records for maps which had never been cataloged before, and we have started to add them to maps which had already been cataloged without this information. This retrospective addition of coordinates to old catalog records will be an ongoing process for the cataloging community as we prepare to move to an increasingly digital (i.e. machine-readable data) environment. Here at BHS, we have begun making a contribution to this work both in our own catalog and in Worldcat.\nTo share this work, we are publishing a preliminary spreadsheet compiled from the records which have been completed on our catablog, Emma. The spreadsheet gives basic information about the maps which are helpful for identification: title, author (when available), date, and geographic subject headings. In addition, we have included the OCLC record number, which may prove useful as a unique record identifier as the library catalogs and other indexes move to an increasingly open linked data environment. Also included is the geographic information in the machine readable and standard formats mentioned above. The information on this spreadsheet can be easily edited and formatted into a CSV or KML file and uploaded as a Google Fusion Table where it can be shared, developed and used collaboratively, or imported into GIS applications such as ARCGIS or Google Earth, tools which allow users to display the geographic coverage of our maps, even for specific points in time. These are powerful visualization tools which will give users access to our maps in a way the traditional library catalog cannot.\nThe creation of the data in the spreadsheet we are posting to Emma is the first step in the process that will bring about such interactive GIS displays. We will continue to enhance our catalog records and expand this spreadsheet, in the hope that we will be ready with the data for future digital projects. It is our hope this preparation will make us attractive to collaborative partners and grant administrators alike. Watch the BHS blog for future posts on our work in this area.\nIn the meantime, be sure to see the interactive GIS-based map created to illustrate individual cases found in the Brooklyn, N.Y., Department of Law, Corporation Counsel records, 1843-1920 processed by my colleague, John Zarrillo. Although John utilized pinpoint GIS coordinates instead of bounding coordinates, as was appropriate for his collection, the map illustrates very well how information such as titles, dates, subjects, or item location information can be easily displayed with the wave of a mouse.\nThe “City, Borough, Neighborhood, Home: Mapping Brooklyn’s Twentieth-Century Urban Identity” project was spearheaded by Julie May (Head of Collection Management), Elizabeth Call (former Head of Reference and User Services), and Jacob Nadal (former Director of the Library and Archives), all of whom contributed to the success of the project. The grant also funded the processing of our Brooklyn, N.Y., Department of Law, Corporation Counsel records, 1843-1920. Processing archivist, John Zarrillo, provided a tremendous amount of assistance in assessing GIS applications for the collections processed and cataloged with this CLIR grant. Thanks are also due to Matt Knutzen, Geospatial Librarian at NYPL’s Map Division, who gave us an orientation on potential applications for GIS information in library records. Finally, we would like to thank the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR), whose generous funding made this project possible.\n For an succinct explanation of how such data can be converted into a GIS-based interactive index, see the PDF of the ALA presentation “Map Indexes: a Practical Application of GIS for a Map Collection” by Christopher J.J.

{"question":"Roquefort vs Gorgonzola: mold origin?","answer":"The Penicillium roqueforti mold used in Roquefort cheese can only be found naturally in the caves of Roquefort, where it lives in the ground and develops in an environment with constant temperature of 7-8°C. In contrast, while Gorgonzola is also a blue cheese that uses mold cultures, it did not actually contain blue veins until around the 11th century, and today uses refined natural mold that is simply added to the cheese milk, as is done with most blue cheeses.","context":["How Blue Cheese Is Made and Why Is It Blue?\nHow Blue Cheese Is Made and Why Is It Blue? Blue cheeses are all made from cow’s milk except from the famous French Roquefort cheese, which comes from ewes’ milk. The blue in blue cheeses is essentially blue mould. But it is extremely good for you. What happens is that an organism similar to penicillin is added to the milk or curd used to make ordinary white cheese. The mold, during three to six months of ripening, grows either in small, irregular natural openings in the cheese or in machine-made perforations, depending upon the type of cheese.\nThe small amounts of mold reproduce or spread to give the typical blue streaks in the white cheese, and, once ripened, the distinctive flavor. Blue cheeses are usually heavily salted to add to the flavor. The smell of this food is due both to the mold and to types of bacteria encouraged to grow on the cheese: for example, the bacterium Brevibacterium linens is responsible for the smell of many blue cheeses, as well as foot odor and other human body odors.\nBlue cheese is a general classification of cheeses that have had cultures of the mold Penicillium added so that the final product is spotted or veined throughout with blue, or blue-grey mold and carries a distinct smell, either from that or various specially cultivated bacteria. Some blue cheeses are injected with spores before the curds form, and others have spores mixed in with the curds after they form. They are typically aged in a temperature-controlled environment such as a cave. Blue cheese can be eaten by itself or can be spread, crumbled or melted into or over foods.\nThis cheese is believed to have been discovered by accident when cheeses were stored in natural temperatures and moisture-controlled caves, which happened to be favorable environments for many varieties of harmless mold. It was moist in the cave so the mold would form. According to legend, Roquefort was discovered when a youth, eating a lunch of bread and ewes’ milk cheese, abandoned his meal in a nearby cave after seeing a beautiful girl in the distance. When he returned months later, the mold (Penicillium roqueforti) had transformed his cheese into Roquefort.\nIt is often claimed Roquefort was praised by Pliny the Elder in AD 79. However, in the text, Pliny speaks of a cheese from Gaul, without mention of origin or even specifying that it was blue. This story was promoted by the ‘Société des Caves. Today this natural mold is refined and used for almost all blue cheeses. The mold culture is simply added to the cheese milk. For the cheese to turn blue, oxygen must be inserted into the cheese through thin needles or skewers. The blue mold then matures inside the air tunnels, developing flavor as it ages. Most mold cheeses take three to six months to mature. In blue cheese, this happens uniquely from the inside outward.\nGorgonzola is one of the oldest known blue cheeses, having been created around 879 AD, though it is said that it did not actually contain blue veins until around the 11th century. Stilton is a relatively new addition becoming popular sometime in the early 1700s. To fill the demand for Roquefort-style cheeses that were prohibitive due to either cost or politics, many varieties of blue cheese originated subsequently, such as the 20th century Danabluand Cambozola.","Roquefort cheese: Introduction.\nRoquefort cheese is the most consumed cheese in France after Comté, it is also one of the most renowned of the blue cheeses along with Gorgonzola and Stilton. Roquefort cheese melts fully under the palate and leaves a light salty taste and a very pleasant taste of mould. It's character is very typical of that of a great French cheese.\nThe ripening of Roquefort cheese lasts for a duration of at least 3 months in the natural, fresh, humid cellars of the mountain of \"Cambalou.\" The cracks on the rocks serve as natural ventilation. Roquefort cheese is formed in a cylindrical shape of 20cm diametre and 9cm long. It weighs between 2.5 and 2.9kg. The penicillium roqueforti, the famous mould, can only be found in the caves of Roquefort. The mould lives in the ground and contains the property which ferments the cheese.\nIn hand-made production, rye bread and wheat are stored, and after 6 weeks, the mould is collected and pricked in to the the Roquefort cheese. This is done with the use of a needle. After 4 weeks, the cheeses are enveloped in aluminum foil to avoid parasites.\nExterior appearance of Roquefort cheese: clean rind\nInterior appearance of Roquefort cheese: evenly veined\nFeel of Roquefort cheese: firm without hardness\nTaste of Roquefort cheese: pronounced ovine flavour\nHistory of Roquefort cheese\nRoquefort cheese is probably the cheese with the richest history. In the 9th book of his Natural History series, already Pliny the Elder cites the cheese as \"cheese of paus des Gabales,\" at the same time he cites another cheese of Gévaudan. In his account, he wrote that the monk of Saint-Gall, who was the secretary to Charlemagne towards the end of his life, recounted an anecdote according to which, during the return home from the campaign he had led against the Saracens, the emperor stopped at the monastery of Vabres, where he was served a cheese of which he removed the green with the end of his knife, when the abbot told him \" Sire, you are removing the best part.\" It can only have been Roquefort cheese that he was eating.\nIn the year 1070, a donation at the monastery of Conques mentions among the revenues, two cheeses supplied from each of the cellars of Roquefort. However, it is not until 1411 that Charles VI acknowledges to the inhabitants of Roquefort the monopoly of the maturing process \" like is was practiced from a time immemorial in the caves of this village.\" Later, many royal charters confirm this monopoly and give to the inhabitants many priviliges of jurisdiction, franchises and rights to asylum. The rulings of the court of the parliament of Toulouse protects the cheese against imitations and confirms the rights accorded for the protection of \"this strong rock\" where \"maturing\" of the cheeses takes place.\nThe term of origin, defined by the law of July 1925, is protected by the international framework as outlined by the Stresa convention, signed the 1st June 1951. The countries who have not signed nevertheless must respect the term \"Roquefort cheese\" the mark having been registered in the national institutes of these countries. It is not the place that the production takes place that is protected by the term of origin, but the place of maturing. For centuries, the production of ewe's milk destined for the fabrication of Roquefort was limited to the limestone plateaux around the village, a territory where, to cite a charter from the 15th century \" neither grows vines nor wheat.\" The milk is therefore collected from the other regions of Rouergue (Basin of Camarès, mountains of Lacaune, causse Comtal, Lévezou) and to those adjacent, the Lozère, the Gard, Tarn and Aude.\nFinally it iwas in the 1950s that the departments of the Pyrénées-Atlantiques and Corsica came to join the \"range\" of regions from which the milk is collected. As already specified by a ruling of the parliament of Languadoc in 1666, the pasture should be so, that it is the same food as in the Causses. Dairy production of Roquefort reaches its maximum in April and May, each ewe giving an average of 100 to 150 litres of milk by \"campaign,\" and around 4.5litres of milk is needed to obtain 1kg of Roquefort. When made by a cheese-maker, it is obligatory for the cheese to be matured at the \"rock of Combalou,\" a zone in which the limits are fixed by a decision of the justice in the application of the law of the term of origin .\nIn this region of Karstic relief, the limestone plateaux are in effect ripped apart by a terrain of cavities and galleries of which the inhabitants of Roquefort have made good use of by creating the caves for maturing the cheese. Dispersed into several stacked levels (of which the number varies from 4 to 11) which are ventillated by naturally formed chimneys which can be up to 100m long (the fleurines), this makes an immense pool producing cold air and a chemical-biological filter. In effect a particular cycle of condensation and evaporation is maintained all year round at a constant temperature of 7 to 8 °C. As for the fine mist which saturates the air, this is the environment where the Penicillium roqeuforti is developed naturally, this is the fungus from which Roquefort gets its beautiful blue veins."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:064a9887-d995-4132-ace4-7b2cc0e53725>","<urn:uuid:29b4f8fe-2a1a-4bda-883e-c8dac888a42d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between heat capacity and the refrigerant component in cooling systems?","answer":"Heat capacity is a property of matter measuring the ratio of heat added/subtracted to temperature change, with SI units of joule per degree kelvin. In contrast, a refrigerant is a working fluid used in cooling systems that transports heat from inside to outside the refrigerator. Common refrigerants include isobutane, CFCs, and ammonia, with isobutane being used in modern fridges. While heat capacity is an extensive property proportional to system size, refrigerants actively circulate through the system performing heat transfer functions.","context":["Heat capacity is the ratio of the heat added to (or subtracted from) an object to the resulting temperature change. The SI unit of heat capacity is joule per degree kelvin. Heat capacity is an extensive property of matter, meaning it is proportional to the size of the system. When expressing the same phenomenon as an intensive property, the heat capacity is divided by the amount of substance, mass, or volume, so that the quantity is independent of the size or extent of the sample. The molar heat capacity is the heat capacity per unit amount (SI unit: mole) of a pure substance.

The food materials kept at low temperature spoils or degrade gradually and can remain fresh for longer time. The refrigerator generally keeps the perishable items at a lower temperature range.\nWorking Principle of Refrigerator\nIt works on the principle of thermal equilibrium i.e. when a cold body comes in contact with a hot body than the heat flows from hot body to cold body until they will not attain the same temperature. In the same way a liquid (called as refrigerant) at low temperature is allow to pass through the fridge compartment. As the refrigerant comes in contact with the air, it takes the heat from it and lowers its temperature. This process keeps continue and the temperature inside the fridge lowers down and keeps the food or perishable items at lower temperature and stops or slows down their spoilage time and can be stored for weeks or months.\nA refrigerator has the following five main components\n- Refrigerant: Isobutane, CFCs, ammonia.\n- Compressor: Compresses the vapor and maintains the flow of refrigerant in the cycle.\n- Condenser Coil: Cools the high pressure vapor and changes it into high pressure liquid.\n- Expansion device or throttling device: Expands the high pressure liquid, reduces its temperature and pressure.\n- Evaporator coil: Takes the heat from the air inside the fridge and makes it cool.\nLets discuss the function of each component in detail\nIt is also called as coolant and is the working fluid for the refrigerator. It takes the heat from inside of the refrigerator and transports it to the outside. Most commonly used refrigerant in the refrigerator are isobutane (used in modern fridges), CFCs and ammonia (toxic gas and not used in modern fridge)\nIt circulates the refrigerant during the working of the fridge. It compresses the refrigerant gas and increases its temperature and pressure. Compressor is the heart of the fridge, without it its working is not possible.\n3. Condenser Coil\nIt is present outside at the back of the refrigerator. It has grill tube and looks like radiator. Its main purpose is to cools the hot and high pressure gases from the compressor. When the hot gases pass through the condenser coil, it gets cool down by the cool air of the room and gets converted into high pressure liquid.\n4. Expansion Device or Throttling Device\nAs its names indicated it expands the high pressure liquid refrigerant and reduces its temperature and pressure. The temperature drops to 20 degree Celsius and pressure to 0.6 bar.\n5. Evaporator Coil\nEvaporator coil is present inside the fridge. It takes the heat from the air inside the fridge and makes it cool. And this cool air inside the fridge takes the heat from the food materials and lowers their temperature.\nHow Refrigerator Works?\n1. The high pressure and high temperature (80-90 degree Celsius) refrigerant vapor from the compressor enters into the condenser. In the condenser the vapor gets cooled down and changes into liquid.\nHow condenser cools the liquid?\nSince the condenser coil is exposed to the room temperature and when the hot high pressure vapor inside the condenser coil is comes in contact with room air, It gets cooled and changes into high pressure liquid.\n2. Now this high pressure liquid has a temperature of 45 degree Celsius and pressure of 8 bar and passes to the throttling device where it expands and its pressure and temperature drops to .6 bar and 20 degree Celsius and partially gets converted into vapor.\n3. The partially converted vapor-liquid refrigerant passed to the evaporator coil and it absorbs the heat from the air inside the refrigerator and completely gets converted into vapor. Here refrigerant cools the inside air of the fridge by absorbing its heat. In the evaporator the temperature of the refrigerant do not changes. The cool air inside the fridge is used to maintain the food items at lower temperature.\n4. Form evaporator the low pressure vapor enters into the compressor. The compressor compresses the vapor to high pressure. But as the pressure of the gas increases it also increases its temperature. And this high pressure and high temperature vapor enters into the condenser to repeat the cycle.\nThe cycle that is used in the working of the refrigerator is called vapor compression cycle.\nFor better explanation about how refrigerator works watch the video given below:"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:43eb9f4c-5add-456d-b4a9-ff3b323cdd50>","<urn:uuid:66d3f4aa-3ec3-4fbb-ac84-64d3f7e4c6cc>"],"error":null}

Almost 80% of all ascites cases are considered to be caused by cirrhosis of the liver and at least 10% of cases are counted for advanced cancer disease. Ascites caused by cancer is called malignant ascites. It has a high incidence in patients of advanced ovarian, endometrial (the lining of the womb), breast, stomach, colon, lymphoma and pancreatic cancers. We'll focus this article on malignant ascites in advanced gastric cancer or swollen stomach cancer.\nStomach cancer, also called gastric cancer, is a malignant tumor originating from the inner layer of the stomach. Over time, the cancer may spread throughout the stomach and to other organs; particularly the esophagus, pancreas, intestine, lungs, lymph nodes, and the liver.\nSymptoms of ascites\nMild ascites usually does not show any symptom, but as it progressed, increased abdominal size are commonly seen. Other symptoms associated with ascites in advanced gastric cancer and other diseases are:\n- Swollen stomach and distended abdomen\n- Abdominal pain, discomfort and bloating\n- Feel very tired (lethargic)\n- Breathlessness due to increased pressure on the diaphragm\n- Nausea or vomiting\n- Reduced appetite\n- Weight gain due to the accumulation of fluid\n- Sense of fullness or bloating\n- Ankle and feet swelling\n- Hemorrhoids (a condition that causes painful swelling near the anus)\nCauses of swollen stomach cancer (ascites)\nCauses of malignant ascites in advanced gastric cancer patients:\n- The result of peritoneal deposits that irritates and blocks the peritoneum in reabsorbing fluid. This is combined with the decreased protein in the blood - due to several factors i.e. malnutrition, liver damage, etc. - upsetting the body's fluid balance and causing fluid to move out of the blood vessels into the body tissues, including the abdomen.\n- Increased venous pressure caused by malfunctioning of the liver or the heart, which obstructs the blood flow forcing fluid to move out from the blood vessels into the abdominal cavity. See also Chronic Liver Disease: Abdominal Fluid Retention and Swelling in the Ankles and Heart Problems: Water Retention in Legs, Feet, Liver, Abdominal, Lungs\n- Other possible cause of water retention in advanced stomach cancer patients is insufficiency of the lymphatic system in draining off excess fluid from the body because some of the lymphatic channels are blocked by cancer cells.\nAscites in patients with pancreatic cancer\nOne of common manifestations of final stage pancreatic cancer is ascites, although it counts for only 20% of pancreatic cancer patients, partly because the patients do not live long enough to develop it. Its cause is multifactorial.\nManagement of ascites\nAscites itself is not a disease. It is simply a symptom manifested by certain health conditions. Hence, the best treatment for ascites is to treat its underlying cause directly. Peritoneal carcinomatosis, ascites in advanced gastric cancer and other malignant ascites may be treated by surgical resection of the cancer and chemotherapy.\nHowever, in some cases, the disease may have progressed into more advance stage that it can not be treated. In those cases, the only treatment for swollen stomach (ascites) symptom is through palliative treatment. The goal of treatment is just to relieve symptoms associated with ascites such as shortness of breath, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, movement difficulty and bloating even after eating very little food.\nSome diuretics such as spironolactone (Aldactone) and furosemide (Lasix) may be prescribed to reduce pressure and promote urine passing thus slow down the build up of the ascitic fluid. Reducing the amount of sodium and restricting the intake of fluids are also suggested.\nHowever, the most common cause of ascites in advanced gastric cancer or swollen stomach cancer is a blockage by peritoneal deposits. Diuretics or other drugs don’t usually help reduce this type of malignant ascites since it is not caused by increased venous pressure. Even if diuretics help some patients, the risk of severe dehydration from these drugs in palliative patients often outweighs the benefit of it. Thus, the only effective solution is through quality nursing care coupled with paracentesis when required.\nParacentesis is a procedure to remove large amounts of fluids by aseptically puncturing the abdominal wall with a cannula, which is attached to an ascitic tube (drain). The ascitic fluid then drains out of the abdomen and collects inside a drainage bag. Up to 4 to 5 liters of fluid can be drained safely through this procedure every time. It is done under local anesthesia. The drain may need to stay in place for a while (as long as 3 days) depends on the amount of ascitic fluid.\nPotential complications of paracentesis\n- Risk of infection especially peritonitis\n- Perforation of bowel, other visceral organs, or tumor mass because of insufficient data on the location, type and size of the ascitic fluid\n- Fluid volume depletion and protein loss\n- Even with these potential complications, the symptomatic palliation from this procedure almost always outweighs its risk. To reduce the risk of infection, aseptic technique is adapted with care. It can also be done under ultrasound guidance to avoid risk of perforation of body organs.\nTreatment may be not necessary if the ascites is mild and does not cause any discomfort.\nIn rare instances, surgery may be needed to control the ascites in advanced gastric cancer and other types of ascites. Such procedure involves putting a shunt permanently into an appropriate location to reduce the portal pressure or to drain the ascitic fluid directly from the abdomen into a large vein. It is done under a general anesthetic and involved several risk of complications.\nQuality nursing care\n- Ascites can add a lot of load to the body and hamper the movement, thus it is necessary to help patients with ascites in positioning and mobilization.\n- The weight of ascitic fluid may impair bowel movement and cause constipation, hence aggressive bowel care is needed to prevent or manage constipation.\n- The burden of ascitic fluid may also lead to nausea and vomiting. Lying on the right side with the top of the bed elevated may reduce the symptoms. Medications that promote upper gastrointestinal motility (e.g., metoclopramide) are also suggested.\nOxygen therapy, along with other medical interventions such as opiods and paracentesis, is often suggested for patients suffering dyspnea, shortness of breath or other breathing problems.\nThe side effects of treatment for swollen stomach cancer or ascites in advanced gastric cancer and other diseases may be uncomfortable, thus you should learn the risks and benefits before taking any available treatment."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a2415ccb-5bab-4b27-9718-90f354eda415>","<urn:uuid:87b4bd16-816f-4de6-a8c4-d9fc7091e3dd>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do birth weight in humans and population size demonstrate different evolutionary pressures, and what genetic consequences arise from these situations?","answer":"In human birth weight, stabilizing selection favors intermediate weights because babies that are too light have difficulty surviving after birth, while those too heavy create complications for both mother and child. This demonstrates how moderate traits can be optimal for survival. Regarding population size, large populations tend to remain more genetically stable, while small populations are more susceptible to evolutionary change. In small populations, even minor shifts in allele frequencies can have dramatic effects - for example, in a population of just 10 individuals, a small change in allele numbers can cause frequencies to shift from 0.25 to 0.5 in a single generation. This makes small populations more vulnerable to genetic drift and loss of genetic variability, potentially leading to decreased ability to adapt to environmental challenges.","context":["Stabilizing selection is a form of natural selection where the average individuals within a population are favored and proliferate as the environment selects against individuals with extreme phenotypes or mutations. In contrast to other forms of adaptation, where adaptations and mutations can help an organism outcompete others of its species, this form of natural selection favors those in the population’s majority, which are already adapted to the environment they are in.\nLet’s take a deeper dive into stabilizing selection, look at some examples, and see how it compares to other forms of natural selection.\nTypes Of Natural Selection\n“Natural selection is anything but random.” — Richard Dawkins\nNatural selection is the process by which evolution occurs, making a species evolve into a different species through a gradual process that takes place over the course of many generations. There are at least a few different forms of natural selection. Stabilizing selection contrasts itself against two other forms of natural selection: directional selection and disruptive selection.\nPhenotypes are the observable characteristics in a species, and when a population of organisms experiences a change in their phenotype it will generally be subjected to one of the three different types of selection. Directional selection is natural selection that favors organisms found on the extreme end of any given set of traits within a population. In other words, the environment favors the individuals who possess the extreme phenotype and over time the population will shift so that the majority of the population has the extreme phenotype and few individuals with the moderate phenotype remain.\nAn example of directional selection is Darwin’s finches, which saw their beaks change as food sources shifted. Finches with larger beaks were better equipped to crack seeds when insects were lacking, and the population trended toward individuals with larger, deeper breaks. When insects became plentiful again, the opposite happened.\nMeanwhile, disruptive selection favors individuals that have an extreme form of a trait over the individuals with intermediate forms, which can give rise to two different groups/populations of an organism. The likelihood that disruptive selection will occur is based on different variables found within the interactions between a species and its habitat, such as types of isolation. Over time, a population will be created that is predominantly made out of individuals with one of the two different phenotypes but with very few individuals with an intermediate form of the phenotypes.\nAn example of directional selection is the peppered moths of London. Moths that were darker in color survived better in London by blending in with the soot-covered, polluted surroundings. Meanwhile, moths found in rural areas were predominantly light in coloration. There were very few medium colored moths left after disruptive selection occurred, with most moths dark (in the city) or light (in the countryside).\n“It is not the strongest of the species that survives, nor the most intelligent that survives. It is the one that is most adaptable to change.” — Charles Darwin\nStabilizing selection is effectively the opposite of disruptive selection, in that instead of favoring individuals with extreme forms of a trait it favors the majority of the population that already has the intermediate/moderate form of the trait. Stabilizing selection “stabilizes” a population by making the intermediate trait the most commonly expressed version of the trait, allowing its propagation over mutated forms of the trait.\nOver time, the majority of the population that has the intermediate form of the trait will consume a larger and larger percentage of the trait distribution in the population, while individuals with extreme forms of the trait will become less common. If you were to graph the distribution of a population under stabilizing selection pressures, you would have a modified bell curve that is slightly taller and thinner than a normal bell curve.\nKey Points About Stabilizing Selection\nStabilizing selection is arguably the most common method of natural selection that occurs in plants and animals, as it essentially just reinforces the traits of animal populations that are already well adapted to that environment, rewarding organisms that have reliable, enduring phenotypes.\nOn the other hand, stabilizing selection ends up driving down a population’s genetic diversity. The disappearance of individuals with extreme phenotypes also means an associated loss of alleles and genes responsible for these phenotypes. Because of this effect, the forms/functions associated with phenotypic traits of an organism can endure for extremely long time periods. Consider how sharks have barely changed in millions of years. Stabilizing selection usually occurs in phenotypic traits which are polygenic, coded for by multiple genes.\nAs mentioned, a graph of a population undergoing stabilizing selection will appear taller and narrower than a normal bell curve. The reason for this distribution can be appreciated by looking at the example of hair color within rats. A species of rat that has lived within a dense forest would have to try and blend into the forest floor with fallen branches, twigs, and leaves. Rats with light coats won’t be able to blend into the brown forest floor, and rats with black coats will have a similar problem. The rats with medium brown coats will be able to blend in better with the forest floor. Eventually, a decline in rats with dark or light-colored fur would occur, leaving most of the rats in the area with medium-brown coats.\n“It is natural selection that gives direction to changes, orients chance, and slowly, progressively produces more complex structures, new organs, and new species. Novelties come from previously unseen association of old material. To create is to recombine.” — Francois Jacob\nExamples of Stabilizing Selection\nOne of the most famous examples of a species with stabilizing selection is humans. If the birth weight of a human is too low, it will have difficulty surviving after birth. On the other hand, a baby weighing too much would create complications for both the mother and the child. In these scenarios, the middle ranges are the optimal birth rate.\nThe size of a clutch of eggs that birds lay is limited to a certain amount of eggs that help guarantee maximum survival rates. Too many chicks mean too many mouths to feed, burdening both the parents and the many chicks. Yet too few children mean that disease or predation could easily wipe out the whole batch of chicks, severely reducing the chance that genes will be passed onto the next generation.\nStabilizing selection is also witnessed in plants, where the medium height of a plant is the preferred height. Plants that grow too tall expend extra energy to do so and can get damaged from the wind. Meanwhile, plants that are too short may not get the sunlight they need to grow and spread.","You should have a working knowledge of the following terms:\n- assortative mating\n- bottleneck effect\n- founder effect\nIntroduction and Goals\nPreviously we examined how the genetic composition of a population is studied. In this tutorial we will examine the conditions that can alter genetic compositions. This theme is central to evolution. Genetically stable populations (those in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium) do not evolve, however, genetically unstable populations do undergo evolutionary change. We will examine those conditions that affect genetic stability, and hence contribute to evolutionary change. By the end of this tutorial you should have a basic understanding of:\n- How the founder effect and bottleneck effect relate to genetic drift\n- How gene flow, mutations, and mating behavior can affect genetic stability\n- How selection can influence allele frequency\nMicroevolution versus Macroevolution\nEvolution is a continuous process, but major evolutionary changes are rare events. Major evolutionary changes distinguish one population from another and result in the creation of a new species. Evolutionary changes that mark the appearance of a new species (or genera and higher) are macroevolutionary events.\nHowever, evolution can occur within a species. Think about the human allele for sickle-cell disease; populations living in areas with high incidences of malaria are better adapted because of the high frequency of this allele. Hence, evolution of human populations has occurred in the past, is occurring today, and will continue to occur. Changes that lead to alterations in allele frequencies are microevolutionary events. At the most basic level, evolution is a change in allele frequencies and genotype frequencies in a population from generation to generation. A population is evolving even if allele frequencies are fluctuating at just one chromosomal location. At the population level, therefore, evolution is a nearly continuous process.\nWe have discussed how natural selection adapts organisms to their environment. As you learned from the example of the sickle-cell allele, this adaptation results in a change in allele frequency. As you will soon learn, however, natural selection is only one mechanism that can change allele frequencies.\nFrom a geneticist's point of view, a population composed of hundreds or thousands of individuals is less likely to evolve than a small population. The larger the population, the more buffering there is against random variations in allele frequencies; an infinite size population would be almost completely resistant to random fluctuations. As you will learn, small populations are especially vulnerable to the loss of genetic variability due to random events; in fact, they may evolve into extinction.\nSmall populations are more likely to experience genetic drift (random fluctuations of allele and genotype frequencies). If a population has an allele frequency of p = 0.25 or 1/4, then the allele frequency of q is 1 - 0.25 = 0.75 or 3/4. (Recall, the sum of all individual allele frequencies for a particular gene must add up to 1.) Therefore, for each p allele, there are 3 q alleles in the population (or a 1:3 ratio). If a population consists of 1000 individuals and 1000 X 2 = 2000 alleles, then 500 of the alleles in the gene pool would be p (2 X 250) and 1500 of the alleles would be q (2 X 750). If the alleles are counted in the next generation, they may have drifted by five alleles (e.g., to 505 and 1495), but the new allele frequencies would be 0.253 and 0.748, which is not dramatically different from the original values of 0.25 and 0.75. Although there is a measurable change, it would take many generations before one allele became fixed in the population and the other eliminated.\nHowever, if the population in the example above contained only 10 individuals (2 X 10 = 20 alleles) and the initial allele frequencies were again p = 0.25 and q = 0.75, then there would be 5 p alleles (2 X 2.5) and 15 q alleles (2 X 7.5) in the population. If the next generation also drifted by five alleles, then there would be 10 p alleles (5 + 5) and 10 q alleles (15 - 5). Therefore, in one generation the allele frequencies would go from 0.25 and 0.75 to 0.5 and 0.5. If both alleles are selectively neutral (have no effect on fitness), then each faces a probability of being lost in the course of several generations, and eventually one allele will become fixed in the population. Heterozygosity at that chromosomal location will then be equal to zero.\nNext we'll examine the two major situations that restrict population sizes and lead to genetic drift.\nThe Bottleneck Effect\nOne situation that can result in genetic drift is the bottleneck effect. A bottlenecking event (e.g., earthquakes, fires, over-hunting) decimates a population and results in only a small fraction of the population surviving. In a bottlenecking event, the remaining randomly selected survivors may not have the same allele and genotype frequencies as the original population. In the new population, some alleles may be found at higher frequencies, whereas others may be found at lower frequencies or even lost altogether.\nIn a small but rapidly reproducing population, the new allele frequencies may settle into a new equilibrium within one or a few generations and genetic drift will typically affect the population for a number of generations until the population size becomes so large that genetic drift is negligible. While natural disasters have historically been the cause of bottleneck effects, overzealous hunting can also cause this effect.\nMany endangered species, such as this cheetah (shown here) and the American buffalo, were subject in recent history to overhunting. Although the cheetah is increasing in numbers, due to increased protective measures, all existing individuals are genetically similar, which weakens the surviving population. Even when a species, such as the cheetah, is protected following a bottlenecking event, the loss of genetic variability may make the species more likely to go extinct. Genetically homogeneous populations are more prone to catastrophes because a given insult (e.g., a disease or a predator) can sweep through the entire population quickly; without variation, there is no natural selection. Hence, conservation efforts must not only preserve numbers, they must also promote genetic variability. Only when some individuals are better suited to the environment than others, can evolution increase the adaptability of a population to its environment. Perhaps the potential to undergo natural selection is one of the best measures of a healthy population.\nFigure. Cheetah (Click image to enlarge)\nThere is reason to think that bottleneck effects might play a major role in extinction. There is evidence that major catastrophic events (e.g., meteor strikes) might have led to major bottleneck effects in Earth's past. Such events might not have necessarily killed off all members of a species (e.g., dinosaurs), but might have decimated their population enough such that they became genetically weakened due to a loss in variability; eventually these populations died out. One book with a catchy title, \"Extinction: Bad Genes or Bad Luck?\" by David M. Raup, explores this idea.\nA disease that kills only individuals with a genetic predisposition is not an example of a bottleneck event. This would be natural selection at work.\nThe Founder Effect\nAnother situation that can result in genetic drift is the founder effect. A founder effect occurs when a few individuals (founding individuals) become geographically separated from the original population and they form a new colony. The alleles present in the founding individuals make up the gene pool of the new population. Most likely, the founding individuals will not accurately represent the allele and genotype frequencies of the original population, nor will they possess all of the variation present in the original population. Because it would take several generations before their population would increase much in size, genetic drift would continue to influence the allele frequencies of the population. This effect is most commonly seen on remote islands.\nFigure. The island of Tristan da Cunha. (Click image to enlarge)\nAn example of the founder effect in human populations occurs on the island of Tristan da Cunha. This island was settled in the 1800's by fifteen British immigrants. There have only been a couple of migrations since; today there are just seven surnames on this island that has about 250 inhabitants. Expectedly, this leads to problems associated with inbreeding (the mating of closely related individuals). One notable problem is the occurrence of retinitis pigmentosa (a rare form of blindness), which occurs at a much higher frequency in this population than in the original population. In several questions of the tutorial 10 quiz, this disease will be used to illustrate how the founder effect alters the frequency of alleles in a small human population.\nPopulations remain genetically stable if no alleles enter or leave the population. Recall, a change in allele frequencies due to interactions with outside populations is termed gene flow (introduced here). If a population were fixed for one allele at a certain chromosomal location and a gamete carrying an alternative allele were able to fertilize an individual from that population, then the allele frequencies would shift and the population would undergo microevolution. However, if the population were large and if the new allele was not selectively advantageous, then the population would quickly stabilize to a new equilibrium. Conversely, if the population were very small or if the new allele conferred a reproductive advantage, then the allele frequencies would probably continue to change.\nA mutation is a change in an organism's DNA. Mutations may instantly introduce a new allele into a population, causing small but intermediate shifts in allele and genotype frequencies. Because mutations are the ultimate source of all genetic variation, they collectively are extremely powerful in influencing evolution. In general, however, most mutations have either no effect or no discernable effect on phenotypes. Because several different combinations of nucleotides may code for the same amino acid, a mutation may result in an unaltered protein. Conversely, there are many other types of mutations that can cause major disruptions. These mutations almost always result in a nonfunctional or less efficient product, but if the mutation strikes a region of nontranscribed DNA, then the mutation may have no detectable effect on the organism. Very rarely, a mutation may result in a protein that is slightly more efficient, or that performs a new function. In order for the frequency of the mutant allele to increase as a result of natural selection, the advantage would have to be great enough to affect the individual's reproductive success or survivorship. Therefore, although an assumption when applying the Hardy-Weinberg equation is that no net mutations occur, most mutations have little effect on the allele frequencies of a population overall.\nRandom versus Nonrandom Mating\nRandom mate selection favors genetic stability. Nonrandom mate selection often occurs in natural populations because an individual is more likely to choose a mate from his or her vicinity than from more distant corners of the population. Frequent near-neighbor matings tend to subdivide the population's gene pool into subpopulations that have less genetic diversity than the gene pool at large.\nInbreeding (the mating of closely related individuals) was described earlier in this tutorial. Self-fertilization (\"selfing\" - introduced here) occurs when an individual fertilizes some of its own gametes (a common occurrence in plants). Both of these mating processes decrease the level of heterozygosity in their offspring. Normal healthy individuals can carry several or many deleterious alleles. Although each individual may carry some deleterious alleles, unrelated individuals are likely to be carriers of different alleles. Therefore, most of the resulting offspring will be healthy carriers as well. If the parents are closely related, however, then the level of homozygosity in the offspring will be higher. In this way, some of the deleterious alleles may be randomly lost, but it is more likely that some of the recessive deleterious alleles will occur in the homozygous state, exposing those individuals to selection.\nSimilarly, individuals may choose mates that have some of the same phenotypic traits (e.g., body size or height) as themselves. This is termed assortative mating. Although these kinds of characters are complex, involving numerous genes, they are still usually heritable. Mating of genetically similar (although not necessarily related) individuals tends to increase the amount of homozygosity in the population.\nGenetic Stability and Selection Pressure\nThis tutorial has focused on how random events can affect allele frequencies, hence affecting the genetic stability of populations. Even deleterious alleles may increase in frequency due to chance events (recall the Tristan da Cunha example).\nOne of the most important conditions for genetic stability is that all individuals have the same reproductive capacity and fitness. Even minor deviations from this state can cause some individuals to produce more offspring than others, resulting in a steady change in allele frequencies. Any alleles that directly or indirectly affect an individual's ability to survive, mate, or reproduce may respond to selection pressure. Under very severe selection pressure (e.g., when bacteria are exposed to a strong antibiotic), a mutation conferring some form of resistance can increase in frequency in the population very quickly. In fact, antibiotic resistance (read \"A Growing Threat\") is becoming a major health risk, and pesticide resistance is a major concern to agriculturists. As you will learn, the example of antibiotic resistance is a result of natural selection because the surviving, resistant individuals are better adapted to their environment.\nSimilarly, an allele that makes an individual more vulnerable to disease or predation is likely to be under very strong selection pressure and may decrease in frequency very rapidly, until it is either very rare in the population or purged completely from the gene pool.\nEach of the phenomena discussed in this tutorial acts to change the frequency of alleles or genotypes in an evolving population. A population in which all of these forces are negligible or absent will remain in a state of equilibrium and allele frequencies will remain the same across generations. Few populations remain in equilibrium for very long, primarily due to the large amounts of genetic variation in natural populations. Frequently, individuals differ from one another in many ways (e.g., from neutral molecular differences in amino acid sequences to differences in appearance, ability, and behavior). Even under relatively strong selection pressure or very small population sizes, it can take many generations for an allele to become fixed. Even under controlled laboratory breeding programs, it can take many generations for a recessive deleterious allele to be removed from the population. Once an allele becomes sufficiently rare in the population, it is unlikely to be found in the homozygous state. Natural selection (one of the strongest and most directional of the evolutionary forces) can only act on the phenotype. Therefore, a recessive allele can linger for a very long time in a population if it is only rarely exposed to natural selection.\nSimilarly, although an individual may have a low fitness level, this may not be indicative of his or her genotype. Not all variation is heritable, and environmental influences (e.g., weather, nutrition, and availability of potential mates) may overwhelm subtle differences in genotypes. A well fed but genetically inferior animal may have greater reproductive potential than a genetically superior but undernourished animal. In this case, natural selection would not lead to a population better adapted to its environment.\nThis tutorial examined population genetics, with reference to microevolution. Microevolution refers to the change in allele frequencies in a gene pool of a population over generations. A population is a group of interbreeding individuals. Over many generations, these changes can lead to new species. However, different populations of the same species can be undergoing different types of microevolutionary changes but still interbreed; hence, by definition, they are still members of the same species. (Think about the races of humans.) Keep in mind, microevolution describes small changes in a population over successive generations, and does not necessarily mean that two populations will eventually become new species. (Although this can happen over many generations.)\nThe Hardy-Weinberg equation can be used to determine the allele frequency in a population. Thus, it provides a useful tool to describe the degree of microevolution that is taking place over successive generations. Not all populations are undergoing microevolution at all times. In certain stable environments, many populations show no evidence for microevolution. (Although if the conditions change, then microevolution often commences.)\nThere are a number of conditions that predictably decrease microevolution; namely: large populations that are more genetically stable compared to smaller populations; no migration/immigration by which new alleles are introduced or removed from a population; no mutations to introduce new alleles; random matings that allow all individuals equal access to all alleles and; no natural selection that causes changes in allele frequencies due to fitness differences between individuals.\nConversely, opposing conditions increase microevolution; namely: small populations are genetically unstable because they are susceptible to genetic drift; migration/immigration that allows alleles to enter or leave a population; mutations that introduce new alleles; nonrandom matings that cause unequal access to all alleles; and natural selection that changes allele frequencies to favor individuals' reproductive capacity and fitness."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:03058182-9c2f-46c9-b366-93083b9634b1>","<urn:uuid:e2be03bd-fe55-464f-ab0e-fcfd4ef1d78d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How should pilots approach pre-flight preparations for a long journey, and what safety mindset should they maintain throughout?","answer":"For pre-flight preparations, pilots should thoroughly gather and prepare charts (whether paper or electronic), make airport and frequency lists, pack essential supplies including oil, snacks, and emergency kits, ensure all power supplies and cables are available, and conduct comprehensive pre-flight checks including sumping fuel, checking oil levels, inspecting belts, airframe, landing gear, empennage, and ailerons. Regarding safety mindset, pilots must avoid becoming complacent with pre-flight checks, never compromise on safety procedures, maintain awareness that 'familiarity leads to laziness,' and remember that safety enables fun flying rather than restricting it. They should also be ready to seek help when needed and utilize resources like Aircraft Emergency 121.5 or ATC.","context":["A few things I’ve learned during many hours of cross-country flying.\nBecause I take my helicopter where the work is, I often do long cross-country flights between my permanent and various temporary bases of operation. (After a lot of careful consideration, I’ve decided that it’s safer and more cost-effective to fly the helicopter from point to point than to buy a custom trailer and tow it.) I’ve been making cross-country flights in excess of 500 miles since 2004 and, for six consecutive years, made an annual round trip between the Phoenix area (where I lived) and north central Washington state (where I now live) for cherry drying work. Nowadays, I make an annual round trip between north central Washington and the Sacramento area for frost control. I flew solo on about half of these long flights; the other half was usually spent with a low-time pilot building PIC time at the controls while I tried not to be bored (or sometimes sick from PIO—long story for another time).\nI flew home from California in late April. It was another solo flight, one that I’d been looking forward to mostly because I would be doing all the flying. And, instead of the 5-6 hour direct flight, I planned to fly west and then north up the California and Oregon coasts before turning inland again. Total flight time would be about 6-7 hours.\nAlthough the flight wasn’t as pleasant and uneventful as I’d hoped, I’m not complaining. But it did remind me of some tips I could share with other pilots preparing to do long cross-country flights.\nPlanning the Flight\nWhether you plan to file a flight plan (which I recommend doing) or not, it’s important to plan for the flight. This pretty much goes without saying. In addition to the usual things to check in advance–weather, fuel availability, TFRs, route options–consider the following:\n- Make your flight segments shorter than they have to be. Sure, Robinson Helicopter claims I can get 16 gallons per hour in my R44 so I should be able to fly 3 hours (less 20 minutes reserve) between stops. But do I really want to fly that long without a break? Probably not–especially after those first two cups of coffee. Yet I’ve seen more than a few flight plans that had us in the air as long as possible.\n- Don’t just study your route before the trip—study everything around it. How many times have I tried to fly up or down the coast, only to be forced inland by a typical “marine layer” of fog? Too many to count. I’ve learned to study my route and alternate routes that would be easy to get to if I needed to change course.\n- Know where the fuel is along the way. Do you think you could make a planned fuel stop if you hit 30 mph headwinds that weren’t in the forecast (or flight plan)? This happened to me on my April flight. I was lucky that there were several airports with fuel along my planned route so I could stop sooner than expected.\nPreparing for the Flight\nOnce you’ve planned the flight, you can prepare the aircraft for conducting the flight.\n- Gather and prepare your charts. If you use paper charts, mark them up with your intended route and fold them with the route easy to access. Then stack them in the order of use. That’s how I used to do it when I used paper. Sure beats fumbling around one-handed. Fortunately, we’re in the 21st century and have tools like Foreflight to provide accurate, up-to-date charts. Make sure you’ve loaded and updated all the charts you’ll need. Use the flight planning tools to mark your route. Then make sure you’re fully charged up and, if necessary, have backup power available. A backup device is handy, too. I use, in order: Foreflight on my iPad, Foreflight on my iPhone, and a panel mounted Garmin 430 GPS.\n- Make an airport and frequency list. I don’t do this much anymore–Foreflight makes it easy to get this info on the fly–but when I used paper charts, I also made a list of all the airports along the way that included frequencies for CTAF (or tower) and AWOS/ASOS (or ATIS). I could then program all the airport codes into my Garmin 430 as a flight plan and make frequency changes as I flew from one airport to the next.\n- Bring oil. I use W100Plus oil in my helicopter. It isn’t exactly easy to find. That’s why I usually bring along a quart for every expected fuel stop. That’s not to say that I’ll use it all, but it’s there when I need it.\n- Pack snacks. I always have a small cooler on board for long flights and do my best to fill it with ice (or frozen water bottles) and good snacks before I go. Even if you planned a meal stop along the way, circumstances might prevent you from making that stop. Maybe you had to change your route. Maybe the restaurant closed 30 minutes before you arrived. Or maybe the restaurant that was supposed to be a quarter-mile south is really more than a mile and a half from the only airport gate on the north end of the field. Bringing beverages like water or Gatorade-like drinks is also important. You don’t want to get dehydrated.\n- Pack an overnight bag. If you weren’t planning an overnight stay, pretend you were. A change of clothes, toothbrush, and credit card can make an unscheduled overnight stop a lot more pleasant. And if you think roughing it might be necessary, consider a sleeping bag or bedroll, either of which can make sleeping in an FBO–or the helicopter–a lot more comfortable.\n- Pack an emergency kit. I’ve spent so much time flying over remote areas that I forget that many pilots don’t. My helicopter has an emergency kit under the pilot seat that includes a first aid kit and equipment like fire starters, a signal mirror, a “space blanket,” energy bars, water, and so on. If weight is a factor–and it certainly is in my R44–you’ll have to limit what you bring. But some essentials can save your life if you’re forced to land in the middle of nowhere.\n- Make sure any required power supplies, cables, or batteries are handy. If you rely on electronic devices for navigation, you’d better make sure you’ve got back up power for them. My iPad’s battery can’t survive a 7-hour flight with the screen turned on and the GPS running. I use USB cables hooked up to a power supply to keep the battery charged. If you have a battery-powered GPS, make sure you have a spare set of batteries.\n- Set up your tunes. I listen to music or podcasts when I fly solo. My aircraft’s intercom system automatically cuts the music sound when a radio transmission comes through. Handy.\nDuring the Flight\nIt’s during the flight that your preparation will really pay off. If you’ve done everything right, you’ll be prepared for anything.\n- Open your flight plan. I recommend filing and opening a flight plan for each segment of the flight. Again, with a tool like Foreflight this is very easy. I can open and close a flight plan with a few taps on my iPad screen. This beats the frustration of trying to reach Flight Service on the radio in a mountainous area when only 700 feet off the ground.\n- Remember that your flight plan is not carved in stone. I can’t tell you how many flight plans prepared by pilots who were accompanying me went out the window before the second fuel stop. Stuff happens–usually related to weather–and changes are a fact of cross-country flying life. The only time I’ve ever done a long cross-country flight plan exactly as planned was on one trip from Wenatchee, WA (EAT) to Phoenix, AZ (PHX), and that’s because our straight line route across the Nevada desert didn’t have any other options for fuel stops. We had to do it as planned.\n- Know when to pull the plug and wait it out. Weather an issue? While scud running is something we’ve all probably done at one time or another, it probably isn’t something we should be doing. Tired? Tired pilots make mistakes. When low visibility, severe turbulence, or simple pilot fatigue makes flying dangerous, it’s time to set the ship down and take a break. If you did all your homework before the flight, you should know whether there’s an airport nearby to make the wait a little more comfortable. I remember unplanned overnight stays in Rosamond, CA (not recommended) and Mammoth Lakes, CA (which would have been nicer if I’d been prepared for snow).\nExperience Is Everything\nMy April flight was a mixed bag. It started with a beautiful but slightly hazy dawn just west of Sacramento, a gorgeous morning on the coast, moderate turbulence with strong headwinds, low clouds, hazy coastal weather, drizzly rain, more low clouds, even lower clouds (and scud running), and bumpy air on a cloudy day. If you’re interested in details, you can read about it in my blog. Although it isn’t common, it is possible for me to have a perfectly uneventful cross-country flight of 500 miles or more in a day.\nIf you do enough long cross-country flights, planning and conducting a flight becomes second nature. I’m always thinking about what’s up ahead and working on ways to get more information about alternative routes when things aren’t looking as good as you want them to. I’ve occasionally used my phone to call AWOS and ATIS systems at airports I think might be along a better route. I use radar in Foreflight to get a feel for how weather is moving and where it might be better or worse than I am. I’ll change altitude to avoid mechanical turbulence. If I have to do any scud running, I do it slowly and carefully, always aware of exactly where I am and where I can go if things get worse.\nIt’s all about planning and preparing and using your experience to handle unexpected situations as they come up. After a while, there’s very little than can surprise you.","There is a truism in aviation that flying requires safety and there is nothing funny about safety. While stern in appearance, this is not the same as saying there is no fun in flying. If there weren't, why would we pursue flying in the first place? Ask any pilot and you get stories of flying adventures, feelings of freedom in the air, and pure \"joie de vivre\" through flight. Safety, and the procedures required for it, are part of the aviation process. Redundancies are part of the pre-flight check, general aviation safety and FAA regulations.\nAny flight, whether a short hop to an adjoining airfield, or a long jaunt cross-country, requires a pre-flight check. Too often, pilots become complacent and do a perfunctory pre-flight. This is a dangerous attitude and one that needs to be checked at the door. Make a list for your aircraft and stick to it, each and every time. The pre-flight needs to include sumping and checking the fuel, checking oil levels, feeling tightness on the belts, looking for any bends or compromises in the air frame, a full check of the landing gear, and going over the empennage and ailerons. The pitot tubes must be checked for debris and any \"remove before flight\" tags removed. This list is a basic outline, and with each different aircraft there may be more items to go over. The notion of \"familiarity breeds contempt\" changes to \"familiarity leads to laziness\" as many pilots may develop bad habits when carrying out pre-flight checks on familiar aircraft. For safety's sake do not compromise on the pre-flight check.\nPilot Attitudes Towards Safety\nThere are several attitude \"killers\" in aviation, and all of them need to be addressed, recognized and corrected if you wish to be a safe pilot who lives to fly another day. Ask any Alaska bush pilot and you hear the adage \"there are old pilots, and bold pilots, but there are no old and bold pilots.\" Having too much sense of bravado or invincibility leads to poor decisions and an over-inflated sense of skills. This is not to say you should not recognize or admit aptitude, but there is a fine line between competence and cockiness.\nThe Safety Killing Attitudes\nAmong the attitudes that contribute the most to declining safety are outlined below. Learn how to recognize these in yourself and fellow aviators so that you are able to correct them before you get into trouble:\nAnti-Authority: When an anti-authority stance is taken, \"cowboy\" attitudes envelope decision-making. Contrary to popular opinion, the FAA is not here to ruin our day, the agency's rules are there for a reason. In order to keep all of us safe, each of us is duty bound to follow rules.\nResignation: By taking this tact, you give up before you begin. Look around at most aviators and you see confidence and aptitude. However, when resignation appears, self-fulfilling prophecies swallow good piloting decisions.\nInvincibility: The idea you are not going to have any accidents or you possess some sort of magic aura that protects you from all things bad. Get over it. Bad things can and will happen to you with this attitude.\nRashness: Impulsive decisions lead to errors. Take the time to think out your moves and choices. Even in emergency situations, the difference between a one or two second breath and immediate reactions often leads to better decisions. Slow down.\nMachismo/Bravado: This is not limited to men only. This attitude has the potential to affect female pilot decisions as well. Ask yourself why are you up here flying. Is it to have bragging rights or to show off, or is it for the pure love of flying? Leave the ego at the door and just fly.\nIn Flight Safety\nWhen in the air, you need to be familiar with the many facets of safe flight. Knowing the proper altitude to fly at (are you flying east or west?), how to communicate on the radio, use a chart, and recognize lights and markers are essential (and part of any pilot's training).\nWhen in doubt, call and ask for help. There are many resources for safety while on the ground or in the air. Examples include:\nAircraft Emergency 121.5\nTalk to ATC\nKnowing how weather behaves, what the topography does to influence the weather and how the airplane reacts or is affected by weather is important for safe flight. Go through a full weather briefing before flights, using any ASIS, or weather resource available at your location. Charts have this information and with Internet empowered devices, pilots have access to weather and changing conditions at the tips of their fingers.\nPlan contingencies if mountain flying and go over the route prior to taking to the air. Foreknowledge is power and power is safety. Keep charts at the ready, or electronic devices programmed with the charts and left on the home screen.\nCome Home and Enjoy Safe Flight\nSafety is not boring or the realm of worriers. Safety is the key to fun flying. May the wind be on your tail and the sky blue.\n- FAA – FARS, 14CFR http://www.flightsimaviation.com/data/FARS/part_121-127.html\n- AOPA Safety http://www.aopa.org/asf/\n- FAA-AIM – Regulations http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/faa_regulations/\n- Aviation Knowledge http://aviationknowledge.wikidot.com/sop:hazardous-attitudes"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c8c54d4c-a1fb-4dc1-b200-92db82cf6ffa>","<urn:uuid:8b9cc92a-26e8-4590-9b6c-56de4ce0637f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the stock material options available between modern Henry lever action rifles and the Rossi Circuit Judge when chambered in large calibers like .45-70 or .45 Colt?","answer":"The Henry rifle offers both traditional American walnut stocks and modern 'All Weather' versions in their large caliber lever actions like the .45-70. The Rossi Circuit Judge .45 Colt model comes with hardwood stocks featuring an unusual but comfortable pistol grip on the shoulder stock, while their .22 caliber 'Tuffy' model uses a lightweight, weather-resistant synthetic stock.","context":["Taurus International has been enjoying robust sales of its multi-caliber revolvers, including the .45 Colt/.410 Judge and the 992 Tracker .22 LR/.22 Mag. with interchangeable cylinders. Working in conjunction with its sister company, Rossi Firearms, the two Brazilian gunmakers have combined these popular Taurus revolver actions with Rossi’s shoulder stocks and rifle-length barrels to produce the Rossi Circuit Judge. This revival of the old revolver carbine provides an unusual twist in that these guns can chamber more than one caliber of ammunition.\nOnce revolvers arrived on the shooting scene, revolver-action rifles were not far behind. The first repeating rifle adopted by the U.S. military for combat was the blackpowder Colt 1855. Available in both rifle and carbine configurations, this revolving long gun exhibited two problems that have been resolved in their modern Rossi counterparts. First, the paper cartridges used to load blackpowder into the 1855 could tear and leak into the mechanism of the carbine. This loose powder could ignite when the gun was fired causing all of the chambers of the gun to go off at once. This event, known as a chainfire, caused the gun to blow apart. Modern smokeless powder pistol cartridges and shot shells eliminate this issue.\nThe second problem with early revolving carbines was the hot gas escaping sideways from the gap between the cylinder and the barrel. This is not much of a concern when firing a revolving handgun because both hands are behind the cylinder gap. Placing a support hand under the barrel of a revolving carbine, as you would with other long guns, resulted in nasty burns to the hand or arm of the shooter. The Rossi Circuit Judge design eliminates this problem with the installation of gas-deflector shields on the frame near the cylinder gap as well as a wedge-shaped flair to the forearm between the cylinder and where the shooter’s hand rests. These enhancements successfully work to protect the shooter.\nCircuit Judge Features Both the .45 Colt/.410 and .22 LR/.22 Mag. configurations share several features in common. The barrels are 18.5-inches long and topped with adjustable fiber-optic sights, and Weaver sight rails are installed to allow the use of optics. The safety features include a transfer-bar safety and a Taurus security key lock located in the hammer. The cylinders swing out to the left side of the gun like most modern double-action revolvers. The external hammer can be cocked for single-action firing or the trigger can be pulled to fire in double-action mode.\nThese two revolving-action guns differ from each other in interesting ways. The .45-caliber model fires pistol cartridges and .410 shot shells from a single cylinder. The stocks are hardwood with an unusual, but comfortable, pistol grip on the shoulder stock. The barrel is threaded to accept a toothed choke, called a straight-rifled choke by the manufacturer, for use with.410 shells. A smooth-bore thread protector sleeve is included for use when firing .45 Colt cartridges. Think of the straight-rifled choke as a full choke for use only with .410 shells and the thread protector-sleeve as a cylinder bore choke that can be safely used with .45 Colt or .410 loads, and all will go well.\nThe .22-caliber Circuit Judge tested for this review is called the Tuffy model because of its lightweight, weather-resistant synthetic stock. The shoulder stock contains a small removable panel in the butt pad that reveals a storage compartment for nine-rounds of spare ammunition. Either .22 Long Rifle or .22 Mag. can be stored in this space and a clear plastic window on the left side of the stock shows how many rounds are present.\nThis .22 rifle uses interchangeable cylinders to alternate between .22 Long Rifle and .22 Mag. cartridges. The synthetic forearm contains a release lever that allows it to slide forward on the barrel. With the forearm in the forward position, the cylinder is opened and a button on the right of the frame is pressed and held, allowing the cylinder and yoke to be removed from the frame. No tools are required. Just reverse the process to install the alternate cylinder and the gun is ready to fire.\nInformal Shooting & Function Testing The informal testing for the Circuit Judge combo guns produced a lot of noise, gun smoke and perforated targets. This particular gun set called for a good deal more shooting than the average review. Having two guns to work with automatically doubles the round count. But one gun can fire four varieties of .22 Rimfire ammunition, including .22 Short, .22 Long, .22 Long Rifle, and .22 Mag. The other one fires .45 Colt loads as well as 2 1/2- and 3-inch .410 shells of the birdshot, buckshot and slug variety.\nThe guns proved to be light and handy while firing standing shots. The fiber-optic sights were bright and easy to see. The triggers of both samples used in this review were smooth in double-action mode with a crisp, short let off in single-action mode. For those shooters who are familiar with double-action revolvers, firing a long gun with a double-action trigger feels great and it’s not a challenge to shoot accurately. However, it may take some getting used to for those who cut their teeth on bolt-, lever- or semi-automatic rifles. For new shooters, firing the Circuit Judge with the double-action trigger may prove more intuitive than learning to cycle the slide of a pump-action shotgun or the bolt of a bolt-action rifle.\nBoth guns were fed from all of the varieties of ammunition I had on hand. The .22 Long Rifle cylinder was charged with .22 Shorts, inexpensive bulk-box rounds, .22 shot shells and premium hollow points, and a wide variety of bullet weights and brands were tested via the .22 Mag. cylinder. The .45 Colt/.410 tasted everything from low-recoil .45 Colt Cowboy loads up to potent standard-pressure self-defense and hunting loads. It should be noted that this gun is not rated for +P, +P+ or \"Magnum\" .45 Colt ammunition. The .410 shells ranged from light target-grade birdshot loads up to the hard hitting 3-inch Winchester PDX1 round that launches 410-grains of mixed defense discs and BB shot pellets. In short, there were no malfunctions, jams, failures to fire or ejection issues. The Rossi Circuit Judge guns proved to be reliable with a wide range of rounds.\nAccuracy Results for the .410/.45 Colt Circuit Judge When it was time to conduct formal testing with .45 Colt loads, I approached the bench with some reservations. While the Judge revolvers can deliver acceptable defensive accuracy with .45 Colt loads at 7 yards, the accuracy is not stellar much past that range. As it turns out, my concerns about the Circuit Judge were unfounded.\nShooting the Circuit Judge from the bench in a Caldwell Shooting Lead Sled Solo, with a Trijicon RM05 9.0 MOA Dual-Illuminated Amber Dot optic mounted on the sight rail, five consecutive five-shot groups were fired into targets set at 25 yards. All three .45 Colt loads produced at least one five-shot group of 1 inch. The best group average of 1.25 inches was produced by Winchester Supreme Elite 225-grain PDX1 bonded hollow points, followed by DoubleTap 255-grain hard-cast lead semi-wadcutters at 1.3 inches and Hornady Critical Defense 185-grain FTX at 1.4 inches.\nThe .410 slug shells tested in this gun performed poorly. This is not the fault of the shell manufacturers. The rifled slugs are .410-caliber projectiles. The Circuit Judge barrel is designed to safely fire .452 lead bullets or .454-caliber jacketed bullets loaded into .45 Colt pistol cartridges. This difference of .044 inches leaves plenty of room for a .410 slug to wander on its journey down the barrel and to wander off once it hits the atmosphere. If you need a solid projectile to get the job done, stick with the .45 Colt loads for the best results.\nThe shot patterns produced by 2 1/2- and 3-inch .410 shells were checked from a self-defense distance of 7 yards using 12x18-inch Birchwood Casey Shoot N-C targets. The straight-rifled choke is designed to stop the spin of the shot wad produced by the barrel's rifling and to compress the shot load like a full choke would. With this choke installed, bird shot groups ranged from 7 to 10 inches depending on the shot size fired. Buckshot loads also performed well with groups ranging from 3 to 5 inches.\nIn order to safely mix .45 Colt loads in with the .410 shot shells in the Circuit Judge’s cylinder, the straight-rifling choke must be removed and replaced with the cylinder-bore thread protector sleeve. With the sleeve installed, bird shot opened up drastically. The 7- to 10-inch groups at 7 yards spread out to cover the entire target surface. However, buckshot loads showed little to no change in their patterns when fired through the sleeve. This is good to know if the Circuit Judge is going to serve as a campsite or home-defense firearm. Accuracy Results for the .22 LR/.22 Magnum Tuffy The .22-caliber Circuit Judge was fun to run with the iron sights. At 25 yards, from a standing position, it was easy to ring a 6-inch steel plate swinging target over and over again. For formal testing, the rifle was outfitted with a good all-purpose scope—the Hawke Panorama EV 3-9x40 IR EV attached with Leupold QRW rings. From the bench, five consecutive, 10-shot groups were fired into targets set at 50 yards for each rimfire load tested.\nThe best single group of 1.75 inches, and the best group average of 1.85 inches, was produced by the Hornady 25-grain NTX .22 Magnum load. Winchester SuperX Lead Free 28-grain tin hollow points produced a 2.7-inch average, followed by Federal Champion 40-grain full metal jacket loads at 2.9-inches. In the .22 Long Rifle testing, all three rounds fired produced a minimum of one 2-inch group. The best group average of 2.15 inches came from Winchester Dynapoint 40-grain copper plated hollow points, followed by CCI Velocitor 40-grain Gold Dot hollow points at 2.5 inches and Winchester Varmint HE 37-grain segmented lead round nose loads at 2.55 inches. It would have been better to see more groups between 1 to 2 inches in size, but it seems the price of having an omnivorous rimfire revolver carbine is the sacrifice of some accuracy.\nFinal Thoughts It’s unusual to find long guns capable of chambering multiple calibers because of the challenges involved in making their actions mechanically reliable with a wide variety of ammunition. Although a revolving action in a long gun does have its limitations, reliability isn’t one of them. The Circuit Judge chambered for .45 Colt or .410 shot shells will comfortably fill any role appropriate for a .410 shotgun and it produces solid accuracy with .45 Colt loads for hunting medium-sized game at short ranges. The .22 Long-Rifle/.22 Mag. interchangeable cylinder model is a lightweight, ultra-reliable plinker that can easily digest just about anything you choose to feed it. The Rossi Circuit Judge revolver-action carbines certainly do offer a unique shooting experience.","henry 45 caliber lever action rifle\nHenry The Henry Original .45 LC Lever-Action Rifle has an American walnut stock and a hammer safety.Style: Hunting.

{"question":"Can you explain the historical methods used for glacier inventory compilation before satellite imagery, and what recent temperature anomalies have been observed in the Arctic region?","answer":"Before satellite imagery, glacier inventory was primarily based on topographic maps, with glacier boundaries manually digitized by correcting aerial photographs. After satellite availability, Landsat images were used to extract glacier extension using the band ratio method (TM3/TM5), combined with morphological opening and closing operations. As for Arctic temperature anomalies, recent data shows that autumn near-surface air temperatures were 2 to 6°C warmer than normal values observed prior to 2002. These anomalies were measured against baseline temperatures from 1968-1996, with significant warming patterns observed particularly during the 2002-2005 and 2007-2008 periods across the Arctic region.","context":["Study area: Belt and Road Region\nGlaciers are very sensitive to climate change and are a natural indicator of climate change. During the past 100 years, in response to increasing global and regional temperatures, glaciers around the world have been characterized by retreat and thinning. The countries and regions along the Belt and Road has numerous glaciers with a glacial area of 100,000 km2. The Tianshan Glaciers provide fresh water for 10 rivers, including two Pan-Central Asian transboundary rivers, such as the Ili and Aksu, which are essential for the survival of nearly 70 million people in the region, their economic and social development, and also for the preservation of ecological systems along these rivers. Arctic sea ice is another important part of the climate system. Changing sea ice has a significant impact on the region and even more pronounced impact at the global scale by affecting weather and climate through complex feedback processes. Thus, any change in sea ice is an important indicator of global climate change. Since 1979 when satellite data became available, sea ice in the Arctic has been melting at increasing rates, with completely ice-free areas appearing in the Arctic during summer season. Therefore, monitoring and forecasting changes in glaciers and sea ice in time and space has important scientific and applied value.\n|Target 13.3: Strengthening education and advocacy on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning, and strengthening the capacity of personnel and institutions in this regard.|\nThe historical glacier inventory before the availability of satellite images is mainly based on topographic maps, and the glacier boundaries were manually digitized by correcting aerial photographs. For years after the availability of satellite images, Landsat images were used to extract glacier extension by the band ratio method (TM3/TM5) combining the morphological opening and closing operation method, and then referring to topographic maps, ASTER images, Google Earth, and the first glacial inventory data to revise glacier vector boundaries and to ensure that glacier boundaries, especially debris covered glaciers, were accurately identified. DEM data was then used to create watershed boundaries and ridgelines were extracted, and an individual glacier was identified. For sea ice prediction, the intra-seasonal and seasonal climate prediction system of FGOALS-f2.1 is adopted. The system was developed by the State Key Laboratory of Numerical Modeling for Atmospheric Sciences and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics (LASG), CAS Institute of Atmospheric Physics (IAP). This system includes the atmospheric-ocean-land-sea ice four-component model and a coupler; the atmospheric component uses the atmospheric circulation model FAMIL2.1, which was independently developed by IAP-LASG. The model uses a dynamic core with a finite volume cubic spherical grid with a horizontal resolution of approximately 1 degree, a vertical resolution of 32 layers, and a top of 2.16 hPa (approximately 45 km). The prediction system uses the nudging method to assimilate the reanalysis data of the atmosphere and oceans in real time. The assimilation data are the United States Global Forecast System (GFS) reanalysis data and the Optimum Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST) real-time ocean data, and the time resolution and assimilation time window are 6 hours. The atmospheric analysis field includes standard isobaric surface wind field, temperature field, and height field data, and the ocean field includes sea surface analysis data.\n- 1:100,000 & 1:50,000 topographic maps.\n- Landsat Multispectral Scanner (MSS) / TM / Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM) / OLI data.\n- RGI 6.0 (Randolph Glacier Inventory 6.0), the first Chinese Glacial Inventory data and the second Chinese Glacial Inventory data.\n- GFS real-time reanalysis data, OISST real-time ocean data.\n⬆ Figure 1. Annual glacier area changes in 15 basins in the countries and regions along the Belt and Road.\nThe changes in glaciers in 15 basins along the Belt and Road (not including the Amu Darya River and Salween River) have been monitored since 1969, and the overall glacier area has been reduced by 9,300 km2, accounting for 17.2%. The glacier area in the inland basin of the Ili River and Hexi Corridor has decreased rapidly with an annual change rate over 0.8% a-1 under the influence of the northern branch of the westerly belt, followed by the Ganges, the Yarlung Zangbo River, and the Mekong River under the influence of the Indian monsoon. The annual change rate of glaciers in the Tarim River and Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau has decreased slowly. However, the glacier area of the Indus River Basin, which intersects the southern branch of the westerly belt with the Indian monsoon, has little change or even an increasing trend (Figure 1). More detailed data shows that according to the completed survey data of the Tianshan and Qilian Mountains in China, the total glacier areas in the Tianshan in China and Qilian Mountains around 1969 were 8,487 km2 and 1,986 km2, respectively. China’s Tianshan glaciers shrank by 16.5% between 1969 and 2013. Glaciers shrank by 9% between 1969 and 2000 and slowed to about 7% between 2000 and 2013. It also found differences between the size and distribution of glaciers due to climate change. That is, the shrinkage rate of glaciers in large glacier basins, such as the Aksu River and Weigan River (larger than 1.0% a-1), is different from that in smaller watersheds, such as the Baiyang River and Kaidu River (less than 0.5% a-1), which reflects that small glaciers are more sensitive to climate change. Glaciers in Qilian Mountain were reduced by 683.674 km2 between 1970 and 2018. The glaciers retreated by 34%, or 0.7% a-1.\nBased on the sea ice prediction data reported by the FGOALS-f2 seasonal forecasting system on June 1, 2019, the Arctic sea ice extent was 9.28 million square kilometers on June 30. The sea ice extent distribution is shown in Figure 5-6 (right). Compared with the National Snow and Ice Center (NSIDC) data, the FGOALS-f2 prediction results are highly similar and can provide reference information for Arctic channel development\nand other related strategic planning. The methodology presented in this case and the production of sea ice forecast data can provide spatial data and decision support for the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\n⬆ Figure 2. Arctic sea ice extent observed by NSIDC on June 30, 2019 (left), Arctic sea ice extent predicted by the FGOALS-f2 prediction system on June 30, 2019 (right)\nUnderstanding the impact of glacial changes on water resources is important for glacial water resource management, and can provide insight into regional infrastructure development and capacity building.

{"question":"How do the nutritional benefits compare between Five Color Silverbeet Swiss Chard when fully grown versus microgreens in terms of vitamin content? What does research indicate about their relative vitamin concentrations?","answer":"While both forms offer nutritional benefits, the vitamin content varies significantly between fully grown Swiss chard and microgreens. Mature Five Color Silverbeet Swiss Chard is an excellent source of Vitamins K, C, and A, along with alpha and beta carotene. However, microgreens can be dramatically more nutrient-dense - studies show they can contain four to forty times more vitamins than their fully grown counterparts. For example, red cabbage microgreens specifically provide four times more vitamin C, 40 times more vitamin E, and 69 times more vitamin K than mature cabbage. Both forms are nutritious, but microgreens generally offer a more concentrated source of vitamins.","context":["Grow a rainbow in your garden with beautiful, flavorful Five Color Silverbeets.\nFive Color Silverbeet Swiss Chard, aka Bright Lights Swiss Chard, is a rainbow of colors, and the greens are quite mild and delicious. These heirloom beauties originated in Australia in the 18th century. There are some botanical experts that believe Five Color Silverbeets are five different varieties rather than one. Regardless of the controversy, this is an amazing assortment of color, texture and flavor. The range of stem colors is yellow, orange, pink, red/violet and white. I have personally noticed this variety growing in varying shades of the five colors. How versatile is that!\nSwiss Chard (Beta vulgaris subspecies vulgaris) originated in the European/Mediterranean region and goes by many names—silverbeet, perpetual spinach, spinach beet, crab beet, bright lights, sea kale and mangold. This plant is neither Swiss nor a chard. Talk about irony. Perhaps it is called Swiss because it was first described by a Swiss botanist named Gaspard Bauhin. The chard reference is probably attributed to the use of the leaf stalk, similar to cardoon or artichoke.\nPersonally, I do not care for beets. So I was surprised by the gentle, pleasing flavor of the Five Color Silverbeets. Eaten raw, the leaves are best used 3 inches long and less, otherwise the flavor tends to be strong. Planting Five Color Silverbeet is the same as for other beets. The seed germinates at 50 degrees (F) and seedlings thrive at 60 to 70. The typical seed is rather a cluster of seed with 1 to 4 seeds in the cluster. Plant the seeds 3 to 5 inches apart in a row 1/2 inch deep. Thin the extra seedlings to reduce crowding. Don’t waste those seedlings! They make wonderful mini greens for salads. The baby greens stage comes in 30 to 35 days, which makes Five Color Silverbeets desirable for succession planting. Cropping (cutting the lower leaves of the Swiss chard plant) is another way to increase the yield of this marvelous vegetable.\nBy the way, Five Color Silverbeets grow well in some shade. This is a plus for those blessed with partial shade and limited garden space. I believe this is a benefit which produces tender greens and will produce into the summer when greens are hard to grow.\nHarvest the leaves by cropping from the bottom of the plant. As the leaves get big enough, use the leaves and stems like spinach or other greens. The health benefits of Five Color Silverbeet make them worthy of generous consumption. All varieties of Swiss chard are a good source of vitamin C and an excellent source of Vitamin K. Vitamin A and alpha and beta carotene (which convert to Vitamin A in the body) are more goodies for your body. A host of vital minerals such as copper, calcium, sodium, potassium, iron, manganese and phosphorus round out the benefits of Five Color Silverbeets.\nGrown in containers this colorful plant makes quite a statement. Try planting this variety in the center of the planter surrounded by lettuce and radishes. Crop the bottom leaves first and pick your lettuce and radishes as they reach maturity. Or use the Five Color Silverbeet as a center planting with edible flowers like pansy. The combinations are endless!\nFive Color Silverbeet is welcome in your edible landscape. The vibrant stem colors with shiny leaves will compliment and contrast with plantings of edible flowers and other colorful vegetables. This variety also works well as a mass planting.\nHow about floral arranging? To use this variety for floral arranging, you must use an entire potted plant. The leaves are too tender for cut flowers. To place in an arrangement, plant seeds in small (2 inch) pots with soil. When the plants are tall enough, insert differently-colored cut or potted flowers to make a striking floral arrangement.\nFive Color Silverbeet is diverse enough to make anybody desire all of its wonderful attributes.

Although you are commonly used to eating fully grown foods, there are other options that can be even more useful and. However, microgreens deserve special attention for they are not only a beautiful natural garnish to any dish but also a source of healthy nutrients and elements, which makes them a valuable product in its own right.\nWhat Are Microgreens\nThese babies should not be confused with sprouts; the latter are greens that can be consumed whole, together with roots and stems, while the former are edible only as stem and leaves. To be more exact, only certain leaves may form a microgreen, which are the cotyledon leaves and the first couple of true leaves of a certain plant. They might be tiny, but their role in improving and maintaining good health is definitely huge. Numerous studies have proven the numerous benefits of this natural product: it may be from four to the astonishing fourty times more beneficial than fully grown products, so it is high time that you introduced this ingredient into your daily diet.\nHealth Benefits of Microgreens\n- Red cabbage microgreens provide four times more vitamin C than the grown vegetable, 40 times more vitamin E, and 69 times more vitamin K. Garnet amaranth has proven to be the richest source of vitamin E among these greens. Green daikon radish is the richest in vitamin K1.\n- Nutrients and minerals.\nCilantro sprouts are rich in carotenoids, lutein, and violaxanthin, and they contain 3 times more beta-carotene than the grown plant. Sunflower greens provide you with lots of protein.\n- If picked at the right time – usually around seven days after germination – microgreens provide the most efficient antioxidant effect. Besides, the high concentration of phenolic compounds also promotes this beneficial impact of the product.\nWhich Microgreens Are the Best?\nThey may be of various kinds, from herbs and vegetables to certain flowers. The most popular are cauliflower, broccoli, and cabbage greens, as well as mustard, sunflower, and chia. Since microgreens are the most delicious and beneficial when they are freshly cut, you may decide to grow them on your own. And you will be surprised by how easy it is to start enjoying microgreen’s benefits, for you may easily grow your own garden in your kitchen, on the terrace, or even right on your windowsill.\nHow to Grow Microgreens\nFirst of all, check the package from the seeds you have chosen to plant for any special recommendations or requirements, and follow them if there are any. Anyway, here are some general steps you should take to grow microgreens:\n- Take a clean plastic container for this purpose and make holes in the bottom to provide proper drainage.\n- Cover the bottom with moisturized soil or potting mix, putting one or two inches of it.\n- Even out the surface, making sure that you do not press the soil too hard.\n- Spread your seeds all over the soil and press them gently with your fingers or a piece of cardboard.\n- Cover the seeds with another, thinner layer of soil.\n- Dampen the surface with a mister.\n- Cover your container with a lid or plastic wrap.\n- Place your improvised orchard in a sunny spot and use a mister once twice a day until the seeds sprout, which may take from three to seven days.\nNOTE: be careful when moisturizing the soil, for it should be moist, but not completely wet.\n- After the sprouts have shown, you should take off the lid or the wrap and continue misting the container daily.\nLight is a crucial element in this process, and if your sprouts end up long and pale, it means that they do not get enough sunlight and will lack the benefits they might provide if grown correctly. Microgreens require about four hours of sunlight during warm seasons, and more during winter.\nHow to Know When Microgreens Are Ready\nUsually the greens are ready for harvesting after two or three weeks after planting. Before “mowing” them check the sprouts for “true leaves”, and if you see them, you can cut the plants with your scissors right above the soil line.\nHow to Eat Microgreens\nAs has already been mentioned, it’s better to eat microgreens once you just cut them. You may put all of your imagination to it, and use them as garnish to your main dishes, eat them fresh in salads or sandwiches, or cooked in soups and other meals. The leaves will provide your dishes with fresh and rich flavors. Make sure to properly wash and dry the sprouts before eating them.\nMicrogreens can add a new flavor to your cooking routine in many ways, some of them – rather unexpected. For example, children are known for their eternal feud with vegetables and eating them. However, microgreens can become a fascinating game that can be played even if you do not have a full-size garden in your backyard. If your kids take part in growing the tiny sprouts, they may grow excited about trying out the results of their hard work, thus consuming the much-needed vitamins and nutrients. Besides, taking care of the mini-orchard may become a rather useful hobby for adults with green fingers as well. Basically, you will not find a single reason not to start growing these delicious and healthy tiny sprouts straight away, for they are one of the many ways towards a healthier and more joyful life."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:08bd1b1e-e351-4fb7-999b-c0e312bd5e4e>","<urn:uuid:44869182-0943-479d-8a25-c50253848c26>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the main health risks and symptoms associated with PCB exposure compared to the different ways someone can get exposed to PCBs in industrial settings?","answer":"PCB exposure can occur through two main routes: skin contact (most common, with rapid absorption into body tissue) and vapor inhalation (less common due to PCBs' non-volatile nature, but risk increases at high temperatures). The associated health risks include: liver damage (showing as jaundice), respiratory disorders, chloracne (severe skin rash), eczema, skin discoloration, eye and skin irritation, thyroid gland disorders, muscle and joint pain, headache, nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and possible reproductive problems. In industrial settings, workers may be exposed when dismantling or servicing capacitors and transformers, cleaning up spills or leaks, or from leaking old fluorescent lighting fixtures. The severity of these health effects increases with longer exposure duration and higher concentration levels. Pregnant women must particularly avoid PCB-polluted areas.","context":["Polychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs) is the common name for a family of chlorinated organic chemicals that contain many individual compounds with varying levels of toxicity. Because of their insulating and thermal stability properties, PCBs have been widely used as coolants and lubricants in transformers, capacitors and other electrical equipment.\nPCBs became a prohibited import in 1975. Prior to this they were used widely as insulators in electrical capacitors and transformers. Other industrial applications included:\n- use as lubricating and hydraulic fluids\n- in electric wires and cables\n- brake linings\n- paints and inks\n- fire retardants\n- fluorescent light ballast\n- carbonless copy paper.\nRisk of exposure\nWhile PCBs are a prohibited import, workers may still be exposed to these hazardous chemicals when dismantling or servicing capacitors and transformers, or involved in cleaning up spills or leaks.\nExposure may also occur from leaking old fluorescent lighting fixtures that may contain PCBs.\nPCBs are proven animal carcinogens and probable human carcinogens. They are a serious health problem, due to their potential for chronic or delayed toxicity, their persistence in the environment and their accumulation in human and animal tissues.\nA common route of exposure is through skin contact. PCBs are rapidly absorbed through the skin and as a result may be retained in body tissue.\nExposure through inhalation of vapours is not as likely due to the non-volatile nature of PCBs. However, at high temperatures, the risk of vapour inhalation increases.\nExposure to PCBs can cause a range of health problems. These effects increase with the duration of exposure and concentration levels.\nHealth hazards which may result from exposure to PCBs include:\n- liver damage (indicated by jaundice)\n- respiratory disorders\n- chloracne (a severe skin rash)\n- eczema and skin discolouration\n- irritation of the eyes and skin\n- thyroid gland disorders\n- muscle and joint pain, headache, nausea, loss of appetite and abdominal pain\n- possible reproductive problems in humans, (pregnant women must avoid PCB-polluted areas).\nRisk control measures\nIt is important that persons conducting a business or undertaking (PCBUs) are aware of instances where their workers may come into contact with PCBs, and take the appropriate precautions to ensure their workers’ health.\nInformation to assist with the risk assessment and control measures may be found in the Safety Data Sheet (SDS), which is supplied by the PCB manufacturer or supplier.\nSpills and leaks\nThe following procedures should be followed in the event of a spill or a leak of PCBs:\n- Prevent contact with PCBs. Eye protection, such as chemical goggles, should be worn. If working where a possible leak onto the face area is possible, a full-face shield should be worn.\n- Prevent any skin contact with the PCBs by using appropriate protective gloves. Check the SDS for guidance e.g. neoprene and butyl rubber gloves have excellent chemical resistant properties.\n- Discard gloves immediately if any tears or cracks appear.\n- Impervious, disposable coveralls and over-boots should be worn.\n- Protective gloves and clothing which have come into contact with PCBs are not to be retained for future use. They should be disposed of as outlined below (Safe disposal).\n- No smoking should be permitted during the cleanup. Workers handling PCBs should wash their hands thoroughly in warm soapy water immediately after handling PCBs and before eating, drinking, smoking or using amenities.\n- If a large spill occurs, form a barrier with absorbent material such as sand, earth or vermiculite, to prevent any escape of PCBs. Clean up and dispose of these materials immediately, as outlined below.\n- Under no circumstances should PCBs be permitted to enter the drainage system or watercourses. PCBs are an environmental hazard.\n- Good ventilation may prevent the inhalation of vapour. At room temperature PCBs do not readily vaporize. However, hazardous vapour levels can occur in confined spaces and when the material is heated. The vapour from hot PCBs should always be extracted from the work environment by using local exhaust ventilation, otherwise suitable respiratory protection must be worn.\n- If working with PCBs in confined spaces, a selfcontained or airline breathing apparatus is needed.\n- If spilt: Soak up the liquid with an industrial absorbent and store the material in a sound steel drum. The drum must be marked and labelled as per the Work Health and Safety Regulations 2012 (SA) [Chapter 7, Hazardous Chemicals] for easy identification and stored in a separate, secure place.\n- If equipment is contaminated with PCBs: Cleanse with an organic solvent, such as kerosene. The solvent should then be stored as mentioned above. Impervious gloves and eye protection must be worn when cleaning.\n- If you have PCBs, or material or solvent contaminated by PCBs, ready for disposal, further information can be obtained from the Environment Protection Authority (EPA).\nElectrical equipment, which is known to contain PCBs but is to remain in service, should be identified with prominent labels, which state:\nPCB material and waste must be transported in accordance with the:\n- Australian Code for the Transport of Dangerous Goods by Road and Rail\n- Dangerous Substances Act 1979\n- Dangerous Substances (General) Regulations 2017\n- Dangerous Substances (Dangerous Goods Transport) Regulations 2008.\nWaste should also be transported according to EPA requirements.

{"question":"Please list the main Unix file permission types and explain how they can prevent unauthorized access in web applications?","answer":"The main Unix file permission types are: 1) Read permission - allows reading file contents, 2) Write permission - enables modification of files and directory entries, and 3) Execute permission - allows running programs and accessing file contents if the name is known. These permissions help prevent unauthorized access by creating a deny-by-default system where rights must be explicitly granted. In web applications, proper implementation of these permission controls is crucial to prevent broken access control vulnerabilities. To secure web applications, these permissions should be combined with additional measures like implementing proper server-side access control checks, enforcing record ownership, ensuring file metadata and backup files are not present in web roots, and disabling web server directory listings.","context":["File system permissions\nMost file systems have methods to assign permissions or access rights to specific users and groups of users. These systems control the ability of the users to view or make changes to the contents of the filesystem.\n- 1 Operating system variations\n- 2 Traditional Unix permissions\n- 3 Notation of traditional Unix permissions\n- 4 User private group\n- 5 See also\n- 6 References\n- 7 External links\nOperating system variations\nUnix-like and otherwise POSIX-compliant systems, including Linux-based systems and all Mac OS X versions, have a simple system for managing individual file permissions, which in this article are called \"traditional Unix permissions\". Most of these systems also support some kind of access control lists, either proprietary (old HP-UX ACLs, for example), or POSIX.1e ACLs, based on an early POSIX draft that was abandoned, or NFSv4 ACLs, which are part of the NFSv4 standard.\nMicrosoft and IBM DOS variants (including MS-DOS, PC DOS, Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows 98 SE, and Windows Me) do not have permissions, only file attributes. There is a read-only attribute (R), which can be set or unset on a file by any user or program, and therefore does not prevent him/her from changing/deleting the file. There is no permission in these systems which would prevent a user from reading a file.\nOther MS-DOS/PC DOS-compatible operating systems such as DR DOS 3.31 and higher, PalmDOS, Novell DOS and OpenDOS, FlexOS, 4680 OS, 4690 OS, Concurrent DOS, Multiuser DOS, Datapac System Manager and IMS REAL/32 support read/write/execute/delete file/directory access permissions on FAT volumes. With the exception of FlexOS, 4680 OS, and 4690 OS all these operating systems also support individual file/directory passwords. All operating systems except for DR DOS, PalmDOS, Novell DOS and OpenDOS also support three independent file/directory ownership classes world/group/owner, whereas the single-user operating systems DR DOS 6.0 and higher, PalmDOS, Novell DOS and OpenDOS only support them with an optional multi-user security module (SECURITY.BIN) loaded.\nOpenVMS (a.k.a. VMS), as well as Microsoft Windows NT and its derivatives (including Windows 2000 and Windows XP), use access control lists (ACLs) to administer a more complex and varied set of permissions. OpenVMS also uses a permission scheme similar to that of Unix, but more complex. There are four categories (System, Owner, Group, and World) and four types of access permissions (Read, Write, Execute and Delete). The categories are not mutually disjoint: World includes Group which in turn includes Owner. The System category independently includes system users (similar to superusers in Unix).\nClassic Mac Operating Systems' HFS do not support permissions, only file attributes: \"Hidden\" (does not show in directory listings); \"Locked\" (read-only); \"Name locked\" (cannot be renamed); and \"Stationery\" (copy-on-write).\nThe AmigaOS Filesystem, AmigaDOS supports a relatively advanced permissions system, for a single-user OS. In AmigaOS 1.x, files had Archive, Read, Write, Execute and Delete (collectively known as ARWED) permissions/flags. In AmigaOS 2.x and higher, additional Hold, Script, and Pure permissions/flags were added.\nMac OS X versions 10.3 (\"Panther\") and prior use POSIX-compliant permissions. Mac OS X, beginning with version 10.4 (\"Tiger\"), also support the use of NFSv4 ACLs. They still support \"traditional Unix permissions\" as used in previous versions of Mac OS X, and the Apple Mac OS X Server version 10.4+ File Services Administration Manual recommends using only traditional Unix permissions if possible. It also still supports the Mac OS Classic's \"Protected\" attribute.\nTraditional Unix permissions\nPermissions on Unix-like systems are managed in three distinct scopes or classes. These scopes are known as user, group, and others.\nWhen a file is created on a Unix-like system, its permissions are restricted by the umask of the process that created it.\nFiles and directories are assigned a group, which define the file's group class. Distinct permissions apply to members of the file's group. The owner may be a member of the file's group.\nUsers who are not the owner, nor a member of the group, comprise a file's others class. Distinct permissions apply to others.\nThe effective permissions are determined based on the first class the user falls within in the order of user, group then others. For example, the user who is the owner of the file will have the permissions given to the user class regardless of the permissions assigned to the group class or others class.\nUnix-like systems implement three specific permissions that apply to each class:\n- The read permission grants the ability to read a file. When set for a directory, this permission grants the ability to read the names of files in the directory, but not to find out any further information about them such as contents, file type, size, ownership, permissions.\n- The write permission grants the ability to modify a file. When set for a directory, this permission grants the ability to modify entries in the directory. This includes creating files, deleting files, and renaming files.\n- The execute permission grants the ability to execute a file. This permission must be set for executable programs, including shell scripts, in order to allow the operating system to run them. When set for a directory, this permission grants the ability to access file contents and meta-information if its name is known, but not list files inside the directory, unless read is set also.\nThe effect of setting the permissions on a directory, rather than a file, is \"one of the most frequently misunderstood file permission issues\".\nWhen a permission is not set, the corresponding rights are denied. Unlike ACL-based systems, permissions on Unix-like systems are not inherited. Files created within a directory do not necessarily have the same permissions as that directory.\nChanging permission behavior with setuid, setgid, and sticky bits\nUnix-like systems typically employ three additional modes. These are actually attributes but are referred to as permissions or modes. These special modes are for a file or directory overall, not by a class, though in the symbolic notation (see below) the setuid bit is set in the triad for the user, the setgid bit is set in the triad for the group and the sticky bit is set in the triad for others.\n- The set user ID, setuid, or SUID mode. When a file with setuid is executed, the resulting process will assume the effective user ID given to the owner class. This enables users to be treated temporarily as root (or another user).\n- The set group ID, setgid, or SGID permission. When a file with setgid is executed, the resulting process will assume the group ID given to the group class. When setgid is applied to a directory, new files and directories created under that directory will inherit their group from that directory. (Default behaviour is to use the primary group of the effective user when setting the group of new files and directories, except on BSD-derived systems which behave as though the setgid bit is always set on all directories (See Setuid).)\n- The sticky mode. (Also known as the Text mode.) The classical behaviour of the sticky bit on executable files has been to encourage the kernel to retain the resulting process image in memory beyond termination; however such use of the sticky bit is now restricted to only a minority of unix-like operating systems (HP-UX and UnixWare). On a directory, the sticky permission prevents users from renaming, moving or deleting contained files owned by users other than themselves, even if they have write permission to the directory. Only the directory owner and superuser are exempt from this.\nThese additional modes are also referred to as setuid bit, setgid bit, and sticky bit, due to the fact that they each occupy only one bit.\nNotation of traditional Unix permissions\nUnix permissions are represented either in symbolic notation or in octal notation.\nThe most common form is symbolic notation as shown by ls -l.\n|Three permission triads|\n|first triad||what the owner can do|\n|second triad||what the group members can do|\n|third triad||what other users can do|\n|first character||r: readable|\n|second character||w: writable|\n|third character||x: executable\ns or t: setuid/setgid or sticky (also executable)\nS or T: setuid/setgid or sticky (not executable)\nThe first character of the ls display indicates the file type and is not related to permissions. The remaining nine characters are in three sets, each representing a class of permissions as three characters. The first set represents the user class. The second set represents the group class. The third set represents the others class.\nEach of the three characters represent the read, write, and execute permissions:\n- r if reading is permitted, - if it is not.\n- w if writing is permitted, - if it is not.\n- x if execution is permitted, - if it is not.\nThe following are some examples of symbolic notation:\n-rwxr-xr-x: a regular file whose user class has full permissions and whose group and others classes have only the read and execute permissions.\ncrw-rw-r--: a character special file whose user and group classes have the read and write permissions and whose others class has only the read permission.\ndr-x------: a directory whose user class has read and execute permissions and whose group and others classes have no permissions.\nIn some permission systems additional symbols in the ls -l display represent additional permission features:\n- + (plus) suffix indicates an access control list that can control additional permissions.\n- . (dot) suffix indicates an SELinux context is present. Details may be listed with the command ls -Z.\n- @ suffix indicates extended file attributes are present.\nTo represent the setuid, setgid and sticky or text attributes, the executable character ('x' or '-') is modified. Though these attributes affect the overall file, not only users in one class, the setuid attribute modifies the executable character in the triad for the user, the setgid attribute modifies the executable character in the triad for the group and the sticky or text attribute modifies the executable character in the triad for others. For the setuid or setgid attributes, in the first or second triad, the 'x' becomes 's' and the '-' becomes 'S'. For the sticky or text attribute, in the third triad, the 'x' becomes 't' and the '-' becomes 'T'. Here is an example:\n-rwsr-Sr-t: a file whose user class has read, write and execute permissions; whose group class has read permission; whose others class has read and execute permissions; and which has setuid, setgid and sticky attributes set.\nAnother method for representing Unix permissions is an octal (base-8) notation as shown by stat -c %a. This notation consists of at least three digits. Each of the three rightmost digits represents a different component of the permissions: owner, group, and others.\nEach of these digits is the sum of its component bits in the binary numeral system. As a result, specific bits add to the sum as it is represented by a numeral:\n- The read bit adds 4 to its total (in binary 100),\n- The write bit adds 2 to its total (in binary 010), and\n- The execute bit adds 1 to its total (in binary 001).\nThese values never produce ambiguous combinations; each sum represents a specific set of permissions. More technically, this is an octal representation of a bit field – each bit references a separate permission, and grouping 3 bits at a time in octal corresponds to grouping these permissions by user, group, and others.\nThese are the examples from the symbolic notation section given in octal notation:\n|Symbolic Notation||Numeric Notation||English|\n||0333||write & execute|\n||0555||read & execute|\n||0666||read & write|\n||0777||read, write, & execute|\nUser private group\nSome systems diverge from the traditional POSIX-model of users and groups, by creating a new group – a \"user private group\" – for each user. Assuming each user is the only member of its user private group, this scheme allows an umask of 002 to be used without allowing other users to write to newly created files in normal directories because such files are assigned to the creating user's private group. However, when sharing files is desirable, the administrator can create a group containing the desired users, create a group-writable directory assigned to the new group, and, most importantly, make the directory setgid. Making it setgid will cause files created in it to be assigned to the same group as the directory and the 002 umask (enabled by using user private groups) will ensure that other members of the group will be able to write to those files.  \n- chattr or chflags which set attributes or flags including \"immutable\" flags which lock files, overriding and restricting their permissions\n- chmod, the command used to set permissions on Unix-like systems\n- Group identifier (Unix)\n- User identifier (Unix)\n- Hatch, Brian. \"Linux File Permission Confusion pt 2\", \"Hacking Linux Exposed\", April 24, 2003, accessed July 6, 2011.\n- Epstein, Brian. \"The How and Why of User Private Groups in Unix\". https://security.ias.edu/.

By collecting and analyzing data over time, OWASP is a source of both intelligence and awareness for the people responsible for building secure applications. Raxis uses the OWASP Top 10 as a baseline when assessing web applications, ensuring that our customers are guarding against each of the most common threat categories. Of course, our testing goes well beyond the items on the list, but it is an effective starting point for security assessments.\nWhat Is a Broken Access Control?\nBroken access control, not to be confused with broken authentication, happens when a user unintentionally is granted elevated permissions or access to an application, user role, or domain. But what does that mean to website users? It means that the user, whether a hacker or someone unintentionally discovering the vulnerability, gains access that was never intended, whether that is access to private information for other users or access to an admin page that allows them to perform actions few people should be allowed to do.\nWhen a web app fails to enforce proper access controls, the results can be unauthorized disclosure of sensitive information, modification or destruction of data in the system, or the ability to perform business function the user should have no authority to perform.\nThis vulnerability has moved from the fifth position all the way to first in the new 2021 OWASP Top 10 update. According to the OWASP Foundation, 3.81% of the applications tested had some form of broken access control. While that may sound like a small percent, the cost is high when you realize the sensitive data & systems that could be exposed.\nA Few Examples\nMany web applications can have a user login page with data such as credit card, phone number, or address information. Let’s consider two users of that application, Fred and Karen. If Karen was logged into her profile, she might see a URL similar to the link below:\nBut what happens if she can simply change “karen” on the end of the URL to “fred”? We would get the URL below:\nBy itself, that is not broken access control. If the application is secure, Karen would be denied access. However, if Karen was then able to see the information in Fred’s account, it would be an example of broken access control. But why stop there? Once Karen realizes she can see Fred’s personal information, she might write a script that tries common names of other people to gather thousands of credit cards to sell on the dark web.\nAnother example of a broken access control is the ability to access a server status or web app information page that should not be public to all users. If an unauthenticated user can access either of the two example pages below, it would be a form of broken access control.\nWhy would that be important? Many attacks require multiple steps, and each step that provides information helps the hacker understand if their actions are working or not. A hacker may use a server-status page to see if their attack is successful, or they may use the getappinfo page to find out what software the server is using so they know what type of attacks to try.\nHow to prevent Broken Access Control\nRemediating broken access control is not a one-size-fits-all concept. Just like people are all unique and beautiful in their own way, and deserve to be treated fairly, not tossed aside… err [deep breath] ahem. Really sorry. Website developers must implement trusted server-side code or APIs that do not allow attackers to modify the access control checks or metadata.\nThe list below is a good place to start with hardening Access Controls in your environment:\n- Implement deny-by-default on everything except public resources.\n- Minimize Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS), instead implementing access control mechanisms once and reusing them throughout the application.\n- Enforce record ownership rather than accepting that the user can create, read, update, and/or delete any record.\n- Ensure file metadata and backup files are not present in web roots.\n- Disable web server directory listings.\n- Set rate limits for API and controller access to minimize the attack surface of automated attack tools."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ef07403e-57f6-4c03-b7bd-d612b8d0b2af>","<urn:uuid:246d106a-3611-4187-a18c-3b96ef1cb2a1>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What types of foods can be preserved using the boiling water bath method versus cold-smoking techniques?","answer":"The boiling water bath method (212 degrees F at sea level) is safe for high-acid foods like fruits, jams, jellies, and pickles with a pH of 4.6 or less. Some foods like tomatoes, pears, and figs need added commercial lemon juice to reach the required acidity. In contrast, cold-smoking is suitable for items like smoked mozzarella, Nova Scotia-style salmon, hard-cooked eggs, and smoked cheeses, with smoking times ranging from just a few minutes to several days. Cold-smoking doesn't actually cook the food but rather adds flavor through smoke exposure at temperatures between 65 and 85 degrees.","context":["See end of release for a video on canning safely.\nHome canning of fruits and vegetables is regaining popularity thanks to the economic downturn and a growing interest in eating locally grown food. A downside to this practice is that if food is preserved improperly, consumers may become ill or die, according to University of California Cooperative Extension nutrition advisors.\nIf practiced properly, home canning is a safe method for preserving food. The canning process involves placing foods in jars and heating them to a temperature that destroys the microorganisms that cause food to spoil. During this heating process, air is driven out of the jar and as it cools a vacuum seal is formed. This vacuum seal prevents air and microorganisms from getting back into the jar.\nIf tested recipes are not followed, foodborne microorganisms can survive and they will spoil canned foods. Worse, consumers can get botulism from eating improperly home-canned foods. Botulism is a rare, but serious paralyzing illness caused by a nerve toxin produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. Botulism can kill if not promptly treated.\nThere are two safe ways of canning food – the boiling water bath method and the pressure canner method. Boiling water is used with high-acid foods such as fruits. A pressure canner must be used with foods such as vegetables, meats and combinations containing these foods such as salsa or spaghetti sauce. Tested recipes and guidelines must always be followed to ensure safe home-canned foods.\n\"It is very important to follow scientifically tested canning instructions to avoid illness.\" said Susan Algert, UC Cooperative Extension nutrition advisor for Santa Clara County.\n\"The boiling water bath method is safe for fruits, jams, jellies, pickles and other acidic preserves,\" she said. In this method, jars of food are completely covered with boiling water (212 degrees F at sea level) and heated for a specified amount of time.\nHigh-acid foods such as peaches naturally have a pH of 4.6 or less and contain enough acid to prevent the growth of Clostridium botulinum. High-acid foods can be safely canned using the boiling water bath method.\n\"Certain foods, such as tomatoes, pears and figs, have a pH value close to 4.6 and must have acid added to them to lower the pH enough to use the water bath method,\" Algert said. The pH can be lowered by adding commercial lemon juice or powdered citric acid.\nWhen canning homemade salsa or other tomato products, Algert recommends following a scientifically tested recipe and using commercially bottled lemon juice to increase the acidity.\n\"You can’t use juice squeezed from a fresh lemon because we don’t know exactly how acidic the juice is,\" Algert said. \"Commercial lemon juice meets a standard acidity.\"\nTo can low-acid vegetables such as green beans without a pressure cooker, the vegetables must first be pickled using a recommended recipe to ensure the final acidity is too high for Clostridium botulinum to grow.\nClostridium botulinum can form spores, a heat tolerant form of the bacteria that can survive boiling. If spores survive because of inadequate processing, they can revive and allow the bacteria to grow and produce toxins. Clostridium botulinum thrives in low-acid foods like meats and vegetables and in the absence of air in canned foods.\n\"The only safe method of preserving vegetables, meats, poultry and seafood to prevent botulism is pressure canning,\" Algert said. \"These low-acid foods require heating to at least 240 degrees F for a time specified for each product. This temperature can only be reached using a pressure canner.\"\nTo ensure safety of home canned goods, she recommends using new lids to ensure a tight seal and following scientifically tested instructions.\nFor more information about safely canning food, visit the University of California's Food Safety website at http://ucfoodsafety.ucdavis.edu/Consumer_Advice and the USDA National Center for Home Food Preservation website at http://www.uga.edu/nchfp.\n- dairy products\n- all vegetables\n- combination products using these foods\n- most fruits\n- properly pickled vegetables\nFoods that require added lemon juice for boiling water bath canning:","How to Cold Smoke at Home\nWinter is an ideal time to learn the art of cold-smoking. If you’ve barbecued ribs, brisket, or pork shoulder, you are well-acquainted with hot-smoking—low and slow barbecue accomplished at temperatures between 225 and 275 degrees.\nBut there’s another type of smoking without which we wouldn’t have Virginia ham, Nova Scotia-style salmon (lox), hard-cooked eggs, or smoked cheeses. That technique is cold-smoking, which uses smoke to flavor food, but not actually cook it.\nAs the name suggests, cold-smoking is done at temperatures no higher than 100 degrees, and more often between 65 and 85 degrees. The smoking time can be only a few minutes in duration, as in the case of smoked mozzarella, or several days (or even weeks or months) in the case of hams. Sometimes, both cold-smoking and hot-smoking are combined the achieve the desired result.\nHow did cold-smoking develop? We imagine our prehistoric forebears gathered around primeval campfires. Someone observed that smoke from the fire repelled pests such as flies and mosquitoes. Someone else had the idea to hang strips of meat (a hard-won prize in those days) near the fire on sticks or wooden racks to dry and preserve them. Not only did the meat acquire a pleasant smoky flavor, but it was more portable and didn’t spoil as quickly.\nMany proteins, such as cold-smoked salmon or bacon, are brined or cured with salt before cold-smoking, a technique that further extends their edibility. Curing is especially important when working with highly-perishable foods as they are essentially raw when cold-smoked.\nHow to Cold-Smoke at Home\nThere are several ways to smoke at lower temperatures, some relatively inexpensive.\n1. Distance the fire from the smoke chamber.\nThat is, burn the wood or other fuel at a distance from the food, channeling the smoke via a tube (such as ducting), pipe, or underground trench. Perhaps you have seen this arrangement: a kettle grill with a small wood-enhanced fire connected to a second unlit grill (or even sealed cardboard box) with dryer duct to direct the smoke to the food.\n2. Use a handheld smoker.\nIf you’ve watched Steven’s shows, Project Smoke or Project Fire on American Public Television or attended Barbecue University, you’ve likely seen him use a handheld smoker like the Smoking Gun to smoke cream, ice cream, mayonnaise, or even cocktails. There are several models on the market; most cost less than $100 and will add a fun twist to your smoking repertoire.\n3. Use a commercial cold-smoker.\nSeveral companies—such as Bradley and Masterbuilt—sell aftermarket kits and adapters to turn their electric smokers into cold smokers. Traeger also manufactures a cold-smoker attachment for several models of its pellet grills.\n4. Use a smoke generator.\n5. Use a smoking tube or maze.\nBoth devices have been on the market for a few years. Fill them with hardwood pellets or sawdust, then light them with a small torch. They lay directly on the grill grate (there is no need to light the grill or smoker) and smoke escapes through the device’s perforated sides, perfuming the food. Check on it periodically to ensure it’s still smoldering.\n6. Smoke the food over and/or sandwiched between pans of ice.\nThis is an excellent and inexpensive way to cold-smoke on a conventional lidded charcoal grill. Bottles of frozen water can also be used to keep the firebox cooler. It works especially well with cheese.\n7. Smoke the food in a refrigerated smoke chamber.\nThis is the technology used by commercial cold-smoker manufacturers like Enviro-Pak. But many resourceful people have repurposed old but functioning refrigerators (or even filing cabinets). Not pretty, but they get the job done!\n8. Improvise a cold-smoker using kitchen equipment.\nCelebrity chef Will Horowitz (of watermelon “ham” fame) smokes all manner of items in his professional kitchen using metal hotel pans and half pans. He puts smoldering sawdust toward one end of the hotel pan, then inserts two half pans outfitted with racks. The food goes on the racks, then a lid goes over all. (If smoke begins to escape, he seals the pan with foil.) Mushrooms, herbs, mayonnaise and other condiments—all can be smoked using this technique. Find hotel pans and half pans at restaurant supply houses.\nAfter cold-smoking, it’s important to refrigerate the food and let it rest. This develops and mellows the smoke flavors and generally improves the texture, too.\nHow do you know when cold-smoked foods are ready to eat?\n- The food will have a handsome brown patina of wood smoke.\n- The surface will feel leathery.\n- The internal texture will be semi-soft and velvety, not squishy and raw.\n- Cold Smoked Scallops with Smoked Tomatoes and Jicama Salsa\n- Whiskey-Cured Cold Smoked Salmon\n- Hay-Smoked Burgers with Rauchbier Cheese Sauce\n- Hay-Smoked Mozzarella (Smoked Caprese Salad)"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b9cb94b6-b1cf-4a2f-ae74-8036f071302f>","<urn:uuid:3d32a5ab-c94d-41b3-ad32-6fdbfd210a4f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What support systems exist for people living with HIV through networks like GNP+, and what stages of cognitive decline can they experience with AIDS dementia complex?","answer":"GNP+ provides support by connecting people to local and global networks, offering tools and resources, and helping build capacities for stronger autonomous networks. They work with organizations like UNAIDS and PEPFAR to ensure needs of people with HIV are reflected in guidelines and practices. Regarding cognitive decline, AIDS dementia complex progresses through distinct stages: Stage 0 (Normal functioning), Stage 0.5 (Subclinical with minimal symptoms), Stage 1 (Mild impairment but able to work), Stage 2 (Moderate impairment affecting daily life), Stage 3 (Severe intellectual incapacity with motor disability), and Stage 4 (End Stage with rudimentary comprehension and near-complete disability).","context":["GNP+ works with communities of people living with HIV around the world to make sure their voices are heard\nBy Oriol R. Gutierrez Jr.\nLaurel Sprague, PhD, is the executive director of GNP+ (The Global Network of People Living with HIV). The Amsterdam-based organization works to improve the quality of life for all people living with HIV through global advocacy, community strengthening and knowledge management. Sprague took the helm of GNP+ in May, but she’s been committed to addressing human rights and social justice issues for more than 25 years.\nShe formerly worked as a global research fellow on HIV, gender and justice with the HIV Justice Network, an international group focused on ending inappropriate criminalization for nondisclosure, exposure and transmission of HIV. She was also on the UNAIDS Progamme Coordinating Board as a nongovernmental organization delegate for the United States.\nSprague, who was diagnosed with HIV in 1991, is no stranger to GNP+. She previously served as a regional coordinator for the North American affiliate of GNP+ and was also a board member.\nTell us about GNP+’s three major areas of focus.\nGNP+ is in the middle of creating a new strategic plan that will guide how we bring all the pieces of our work under an overarching focus. Nothing that we are doing now will be lost, but the way we will approach it will be different as we move forward.\nOur global advocacy work has been shaped by consultations done with different communities of people living with HIV across the world. We came up with a pretty big global advocacy agenda, and from that, the first area we focused on was treatment access and access to prevention, care and support with HIV. We’re trying to make sure that all people are able to access prevention. We also want treatment for HIV to be offered in ways that are nonstigmatizing and nondiscriminatory so that we can all access the kind of care and support related to the medical treatment that we need.\nSecond, the human rights part of our work is about the comprehensive quality of life for people living with HIV and the comprehensive ability to live life with dignity. This work deals with fighting stigma, discrimination and criminal laws that target people living with HIV and people who are LGBT, as well as laws that target sex workers and people who use drugs and treat women unfairly.\nFinally, the knowledge management piece of our work has involved looking at human rights violations, training people with HIV to document human rights violations and sharing what’s happening at the national level so that we can bring that information forward. We have gathered an incredible amount of information that we haven’t always had the time and capacity to use completely. Moving forward, we want to develop the infrastructure so that we can take all this information and share it and use it in even more powerful ways.\nThose three areas of the agenda come together in a framework called Positive Health, Dignity and Prevention (PHDP). It looks at the comprehensiveness of life for people living with HIV and the way in which our treatment, employment, housing, access to sexual reproductive health and rights and so many other things are all interconnected. They create this sort of organic whole that is the picture of our lives and the context within which we have to operate.\nWhat changes are in store for GNP+?\nLast November, our board, which was made up of representatives from each region of people living with HIV, made the decision to restructure the board in order to have a better representation of all the key populations of people living with HIV. There will be much more space for the broadest diversity possible among board members and a constant focus of attention on groups that are marginalized.\nThe next big change is the restructuring of the GNP+ Secretariat. Over the last few years, we have become very project-based, and there is a real commitment to shaping the organization so that we are principles-based. We’re committed to setting a vision for how people living with HIV should be able to live in the world and orienting our work around that.\nDescribe your relationship with local and global groups.\nAs a global network, GNP+ sometimes serves in a convening role but also offers support toward autonomous networks of people living with HIV.\nWe primarily work to make tools and resources available. We can link people to training and support that they need and help with the basic processes they need to create a structure, to work with a board, to reach out to funders and things like that. We try to help build capacities so that networks can be stronger on their own.\nThere’s a lot of work around collecting information, sharing it, reporting it and monitoring it, specifically around stigma, human rights violations and criminalization and keeping track of legal and regulatory barriers to HIV testing.\nWorking at the global level with organizations like UNAIDS, Global Fund, Unitaid and PEPFAR, we do our best to make sure that the needs of people living with HIV worldwide are reflected in their guidelines, best practices and decision making. We then reflect that information and what we learn in global settings back to regional and national levels. We’re trying to maintain the clearest picture of what’s happening in different regions and countries so that we’re able to accurately reflect what’s happening out in the world.\nWhat are some of your top concerns?\nThere’s a big challenge in reestablishing the primacy of human rights as a central tenet in addressing HIV and issues around health and health equity broadly. The more biomedical approaches we have to HIV, the more it seems that there’s a sense that human rights and decency can fall by the wayside.\nAnother major priority is access to treatment. I think it’s great to report the successes around HIV, but many of us know what it looks like to die of AIDS-related illness. It looks exactly the same now as it did in 1981, and half of the people worldwide who have HIV don’t have treatment, which means they’re facing exactly what we were all facing in the ’80s and early ’90s.\nWe need to figure out what to do to get people the treatment they need. Part of it has to do with reducing stigma and discrimination in health care facilities, but also within our communities. We need to look at the ways that we stigmatize ourselves and one another. We need to commit to creating spaces where there is room for everyone and we can work together.\nAnother big part of the problem of getting people access to treatment is the price of drugs. We know that GNP+ needs to have a much louder voice, and in many ways, we all need to have a much louder voice to say that it’s not acceptable that profits are made on the backs of human lives in the way that they are right now.\nHow are you absorbing this change?\nI’m honored that the board selected me to lead GNP+. It feels like a heavy responsibility, but the weight is lightened by the number of people who have offered support – especially people living with HIV. We’re joining forces and doing it together. We are creating a united movement, and it means the world to me.\nWhat advice can you give to people living with HIV who want to get involved?\nI will always be the biggest proponent of getting involved in networks of people living with HIV because that’s made all the difference for me. The best networks to join are your local networks. I can’t think of anything that makes us stronger in terms of both our own self-love and our love for the people in our communities than our networks.\nI hope people will also connect with GNP+ through our website or Facebook because we have lots of interesting webinars and information to share. If you can connect with us, then you’ll know what’s happening – you’ll be part of it.\nOriol R. Gutierrez Jr. is the editor-in-chief of POZ magazine. Find him on Twitter @oriolgutierrez.

It is is a metabolic encephalopathy induced by HIV infection and fueled by immune activation of brain macrophages and microglia. These cells are actively infected with HIV and secrete neurotoxins of both host and viral origin. The essential features of ADC are disabling cognitive impairment accompanied by motor dysfunction, speech problems and behavioural change. Cognitive impairment is characterised by mental slowness, trouble with memory and poor concentration. Motor symptoms include a loss of fine motor control leading to clumsiness, poor balance and tremors. Behavioural changes may include apathy, lethargy and diminished emotional responses and spontaneity. Histopathologically, it is identified by the infiltration of monocytes and macrophages into the central nervous system (CNS), gliosis, pallor of myelin sheaths, abnormalities of dendritic processes and neuronal apoptosis.\nADC typically occurs after years of HIV infection and is associated with low CD4+ T cell levels and high plasma viral loads. It is sometimes seen as the first sign of the onset of AIDS. Prevalence is between 10-20% in Western countries and has only been seen in 1-2% of India based infections. With the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the frequency of ADC has declined in developed countries. HAART may not only prevent or delay the onset of ADC in people with HIV infection, it can also improve mental function in people who already have ADC.\nDementia only exists when neurocognitive impairment in the patient is severe enough to interfere markedly with day-to-day function. That is, the patient is typically unable to work and may not be able to take care of him or herself. Before this, the patient is said to have a mild neurocognitive disorder.\n- Marked acquired impairment of at least two ability domains of cognitive function (e.g. memory, attention): typically, the impairment is in multiple domains, especially in learning, information processing and concentration/attention. The cognitive impairment is ascertained by medical history, mental status examination or neuropsychological testing.\n- Cognitive impairments identified in 1. interfere markedly with day-to-day functioning.\n- Cognitive impairments identified in 1. are present for at least one month.\n- Cognitive impairments identified in 1. do not meet the criteria for delirium, or if delirium is present, dementia was diagnosed when delirium was not present.\n- No evidence of another, pre-existing aetiology that could explain the dementia (e.g. another CNS infection, CNS neoplasm, cerebrovascular disease, pre-existing neurological disease, severe substance abuse compatible with CNS disorder.\nWhile the progression of dysfunction is variable, it is regarded as a serious complication and, untreated, can progress to a fatal outcome. Diagnosis is made by neurologists who carefully rule out alternative diagnoses. This routinely requires a careful neurological examination, brain scans (MRI or CT scan) and a lumbar puncture to evaluate the cerebrospinal fluid. No single test is available to confirm the diagnosis, but the constellation of history, laboratory findings, and examination can reliably establish the diagnosis when performed by experienced clinicians. The amount of virus in the brain does not correlate well with the degree of dementia, suggesting that secondary mechanisms are also important in the manifestation of ADC.\nAIDS Dementia Complex (ADC) is not a true opportunistic infection. It is one of the few conditions caused directly by HIV itself. But it is not quite as simple as that because the central nervous system can be damaged by a number of other causes:\n- opportunistic infections - there are many\n- Primary cerebral lymphoma or metastasis of other AIDS-related cancers\n- direct effects of HIV in the brain\n- toxic effects of drug treatments\nMany researchers believe that HIV damages the vital brain cells, neurons, indirectly. According to one theory, HIV either infects or activates cells that nurture and maintain the brain, known as macrophages and microglia. These cells then produce toxins that can set off a series of reactions that instruct neurons to kill themselves. The infected macrophages and microglia also appear to produce additional factors chemokines and cytokines - that can affect neurons as well as other brain cells known as astrocytes. The affected astrocytes, which normally nurture and protect neurons, also may now end up harming neurons. Researchers hope that new drugs under investigation will interfere with the detrimental cycle and prevent neuron death.\nADC stage characteristicsEdit\n- Stage 0 (Normal) Normal Mental and Motor Function\n- Stage 0.5 (Subclinical) Minimal symptoms of cognitive or motor dysfunction characteristic of ADC, or mild signs (snout response, slowed extremity movements), but without impairment of work or capacity to perform activities of daily living (ADL). Gait and strength are normal.\n- Stage 1 (Mild) Evidence of functional intellectual or motor impairment characteristic of ADC, but able to perform all but the more demanding aspects of work or ADL. Can walk without assistance.\n- Stage 2 (Moderate) Cannot work or maintain the more demanding aspects of daily life, but able to perform basic activities of self care. Ambulatory, but may require a single prop.\n- Stage 3 (Severe) Major intellectual incapacity - cannot follow news or personal events, cannot sustain complex conversation, considerable slowing of all output. And/or motor disability - cannot walk unassisted, requiring walker or personal support, usually with slowing and clumsiness of arms as well.\n- Stage 4 (End Stage) Nearly vegetative. Intellectual and social comprehension and responses are at a rudimentary level. Nearly or absolutely mute. Paraparetic or paraplegic with double incontinence.\nReferences and notesEdit\n- ↑ 1.0 1.1 Gray, F., Adle-Biassette, H., Chrétien, F., Lorin de la Grandmaison, G., Force, G., Keohane, C. (2001).

{"question":"Is illegal deer jacking a common problem, and what damage can deer cause to property?","answer":"Deer jacking is a significant issue that typically occurs in remote rural areas late at night, with poachers using spotlights to freeze deer for illegal shooting. During a recent enforcement initiative, authorities found 79 instances where hunters were caught using lights but hadn't yet killed deer. As for property damage, deer can cause significant problems for nurseries, Christmas tree growers, and arborists through their browsing activity and during mating season. Male deer damage trees by rubbing their antlers against them, removing bark and exposing trees to insects and disease. They leave distinctive square or ragged breaks when browsing on vegetation, using their bottom jaw incisors against their incisor-free upper jaw.","context":["A major operation to crack down on illegal deer poaching across the state has led to charges against 137 individuals for more than 250 offenses, the state Department of Environmental Conservation announced Thursday.\nBy region, 124 misdemeanors and violations were filed in the Adirondack Park and surrounding North Country, 48 were filed in the Capital Region and Catskills, 47 in Central New York, 24 in Western New York and nine on Long Island.\nFifteen guns were confiscated, along with seven spotlights and eight illegally-taken deer.\nEnvironmental conservation officers were dispatched across the state this fall to track down illegal deer poaching practices.\n(Enterprise photo — Mike Lynch)\nDEC Region 5 Captain Lawrence DiDonato said that there were 16 people charged in his region.\n\"We've always worked on deer jacking,\" DiDonato said. \"(But) this is the largest initiative in the state's history.\"\nThe initiative, dubbed \"Operation Dark Night,\" focused on the illegal taking of deer by use of artificial light - a practice commonly known as \"deer jacking.\" This involves nighttime wildlife crimes where poachers shine a spotlight on a deer feeding in fields to \"freeze\" the animal long enough to shoot it. Typically, deer jacking occurs in remote rural areas, late at night. Due to these late hours and secluded areas, there are few, if any, witnesses to this crime.\nDuring a seven-week period this fall, environmental conservation officers were assigned to saturation patrols in targeted rural locations in every part of the state except New York City, with stakeouts taking place at all hours of the night. While ECOs are vigilant for wildlife poaching crimes throughout the year, these targeted patrols largely covered the weeks before the start of the southern zone deer season, when the DEC historically fields numerous complaints about deer jacking.\n\"Our officers' work sends a strong message that such illegal practices will not be tolerated,\" said Peter Fanelli, DEC's Director of Law Enforcement. \"During this operation, they put in long hours at night, often dealing with armed individuals. Their effort speaks of their dedication to the job and to protecting New York's natural resources.\"\nDuring the seven-week operation, DEC officers charged 137 individuals with more than 250 misdemeanors and violations. This included 10 instances of killing a deer at night with the use of a spotlight or other artificial light and 79 instances where a hunter was caught using a light, but had not yet killed a deer.\nTypically, other related charges were filed in these instances, such as carrying a loaded gun in a vehicle, discharging a firearm over a public highway or within 500 feet of a dwelling and using a spotlight within 500 feet of a dwelling.\nMany Environmental Conservation Law offenses relating to deer jacking are misdemeanors which may result in significant fines and/or jail time. Additionally, hunting license privileges of convicted deer poachers may be revoked in New York, as well as other states that are members of the Wildlife Violator Compact and honor reciprocal revocations.\n\"Taking of deer with the aid of an artificial light\" is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of $250 to $2,000 and/or incarceration for up to one year, as well as possible revocation of hunting privileges for up to five years, according to the law.\n\"Operating an artificial light on lands inhabited by deer while possessing a firearm\" is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of $200 to $1,000 and/or incarceration for up to 90 days.","White-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) are perhaps the best known species of big game wildlife, especially in the state of Wisconsin. They are a native species and therefore belong on the landscape. In addition, they have intrinsic value, such as providing a host of ecosystem services (seed dispersers), and being a valuable part of the food chain in terms of prey for predators. Aside from these benefits, their extrinsic values are also numerous, for example, people get immense enjoyment from feeding, seeing, photographing, and painting pictures of deer, especially mature bucks with a full set of antlers. Undoubtedly however what gets many the most excited is the opportunity to harvest a deer for the meat and taxidermy mount, plus the stories that go with each deer season. And accompanying deer harvest is a very generous boost to the state’s economy. According to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR), hunting generates $2.5 billion dollars annually from hunting license sales, purchase of hunting gear, and food, fuel, and lodging/trip expenses to access hunting areas; in addition to jobs directly and indirectly associated with hunting. Eighty-eight percent of the $2.5 billion total each year comes from the 9-day deer gun season, according to the WDNR.\nDespite all of the benefits associated with white-tailed deer, negative consequences result from deer on the landscape. Deer can create problems, for example, for nursery and Christmas tree growers and arborists, primarily through browsing activity and during the mating season when they tend to rub woody vegetation with their antlers. Being herbivores deer eat a wide variety of plant and woody vegetation. Having permanently lost the incisors (front teeth) on their upper jaw, deer pinch vegetation between the incisors on their bottom jaw and the incisor-free upper jaw as they chew and pull on the plant material, leaving a square or ragged break where the browse occurs. Male deer (bucks) grow antlers, beginning in late spring each year. Antler growth is regulated by increasing hormone levels (mostly testosterone) in the male’s body, and hormone levels are regulated by increasing day length in the spring and decreasing day length in the fall. By end of each summer, antler growth is nearly complete. Most antler damage to woody vegetation occurs in the fall when bucks rub trees to remove velvet (hair-like material) from their antlers and to scent-mark their territory. Buck rubs can be seen between ground level and about 3-4 feet above ground level; tend to occur most commonly on smaller diameter trees; and have the appearance of the outer bark being shredded or removed, exposing the inner bark. Buck rubs can be unsightly, especially on trees for sale, but also expose the tree to insect and disease damage.\nThere are a range of management options to reduce or eliminate deer damage, but it is most effective to choose the best practice based on the specific situation and location. Where possible the most cost-efficient management option for deer damage is almost always to harvest deer to reduce the local population, thereby potentially reducing the amount of damage. If you’re able to harvest deer on your property, a number of deer seasons occur throughout the fall and into early winter. It is important to understand the buck to doe ratio in your area; for example, if there are four does (or antlerless deer) for every buck, you should harvest at least four does for every buck harvested on your property in order to at least stabilize the growth of the deer population. Harvesting five or six does for every buck would help to decrease the deer population on your property. In addition, you may be eligible for deer depredation permits depending on your location and the types of agricultural crops (including trees) you grow. Depredation permits allow you to harvest deer outside of defined deer seasons. Check with your county biologist with the WDNR to see if you’re eligible for depredation permits.\nOutside of the lethal option of harvesting deer, a number of non-lethal management practices also exist. The most effective non-lethal option to protect trees from both browse and rub damage is some type of fencing to prevent deer from accessing the plant material. Fencing may be relatively inexpensive and temporary, like electric fencing, or more permanent (up to 30 years) and relatively expensive like 8-foot tall, high-tensile woven wire fencing. Electric or high-tensile fencing can be used to exclude deer from a relatively large area; in addition to fencing off large areas, individual trees may be protected using tree guards. Tree guards can be purchased commercially or made from a variety of materials, including screen, chicken wire, or chain link fence, among other materials.\nManagement practices other than fencing, like repellents and an assortment of harassment measures may be effective, depending on the situation. However, these type of management options tend to be relatively short-term in their effectiveness, can be relatively expensive, and labor intensive.\nLastly, you may be eligible for the Wisconsin Wildlife Damage Abatement and Claims Program (WDACP), a state program that cost-shares non-lethal management practices like deer fencing and financially compensates the land owner for deer damage. Check with your county biologist with the WDNR to see if you’re eligible for the WDACP.\nArticle by: David Drake, Extension Wildlife Specialist / Professor, Dept. of Forest and Wildlife Ecology, University of Wisconsin-Madison"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2146a93c-000e-4663-8df0-5010af4ebb7f>","<urn:uuid:9f78165a-0487-4c05-8c3e-92dcf23f89fb>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do separation patterns differ between reattaching and non-reattaching flows, and how does this impact vortex meter performance?","answer":"In flow separation, non-reattaching flows involve interactions between opposite-signed vortices shed from separation points (as seen in flow past cylinders), while reattaching flows involve interaction between vortices and the solid surface. This distinction is crucial for vortex meters, as their performance can be affected by changes in the shedder bar geometry. The vortex meter's accuracy depends on proper vortex formation and detection, which can be compromised by erosion, deposits, or improper securing of the shedder bar. The meter requires clean, low-viscosity fluids for optimal performance and has limitations at very low flow rates where vortex formation may not occur consistently.","context":["Presentation on theme: \"1 FLOW SEPARATION Aerodynamics Bridge-Pier Design Combustion Chambers Human Blood Flow Building Design Etc.

(Form Drag, Pressure Distribution, Forces and Moments, Heat And Mass Transfer, Vortex Shedding)\n2 Separation and Drag Total drag = friction drag + form drag No separation, then friction drag dominates, with separation form drag dominates. boundary layer separation results in a large increase in the drag on the body because of increased form drag.\n3 Applying Bernoulli´s equation to the streamline around the cylinder we find that the pressure distribution is symmetrical also so that the total pressure force on the upstream side of the cylinder is exactly equal to the pressure on the downwind side. So net force on the cylinder is zero. If the flow of a viscous fluid about a body is such that the boundary layer remains attached, then we have almost the same result--we'll just have a small drag due to the skin friction. However, if the boundary layer separates and the coefficient of drag is 1.2, much larger that the coefficient of drag due to skin friction 0.01. Why does separation increase the drag ? Start from D’Alambert’s paradox\n4 Some interesting drag facts increases with the cube of the speed. What it means is Its going to take you 8 times the power to ride a bicycle at 30 mph than riding it at 15 mph. a dimpled golf ball has one-fifth the drag of a smooth golf ball of the same size. Why ?\n5 3D Separation classification by Skin-friction Topology Open and Closed type separation Open - Flow upstream of separation enters separation region. Separation occurs along a dividing streamline Closed – Flow upstream of separation does not enter the separation region (bubble). Flow separates from a saddle point of separation.\n7 Classification based on shear layer reattachment Separation without reattachment Interactions between opposite signed vortices shed from separation points (e.g. Flow past cylinders, spheres, normal flat plates etc) Separation with reattachment Interaction between vortices and the solid surface (e.g. Flow past leading edge blunt cylinders, backward facing steps etc)\n8 Distinguishing features between the two kinds of classification Open and closed should not be confused with reattaching and non-reattaching All open separation is non-reattaching, but, closed separation can either be non-reattaching or reattaching, (i.e.) the separation bubble may shed or attach to the body Also, open and closed terminology is mainly used only for 3D separation as saddles and nodes cannot be accurately defined in 2D separation. Non-reattaching or reattaching terminology is more general in that sense.\n9 Main instabilities in separated flows 1. Initial instability Kelvin Helmholtz instability (Both non-reattaching and reattaching) vortex formation due to roll up of shear layer vortex sheet\n10 Main instabilities in separated flows 2. Karman instability Non-reattaching opposite signed vortices interaction (asymmetric vortex shedding) Reattaching vortex and image interaction (symmetric vortex shedding)\n11 Initial instability causes KH vortices KH vortices amalgamate to form large scale vortices Large scale vortices impinge on body Karman type shedding (symmetric mode -interaction with mirror vortex) Karman type shedding in reattaching flows, illustrative example (leading edge of blunt cylinder)\n12 Main instabilities in separated flows 3. Low frequency modulation Non reattaching - vortex dislocations in flow past cylinders Reattaching - flapping instability (enlarging and shrinking of separation bubble)\n13 The Strouhal Number is a dimensionless value useful for analyzing oscillating, unsteady fluid flow dynamics problems. The Strouhal Number can be expressed as: St = ω l / v where St = Strouhal Number ω = oscillation frequency l = relevant length scale v = relevant velocity scale The Strouhal Number\n14 where Sr is the General Strouhal number, f is the frequency of vortex shedding, D is the hydraulic diameter or length of the object in the fluid flow and V is the velocity of the fluid General Strouhal Number Buffer the body, lower the general Strouhal number\n15 Relevant scales for Strouhal number KH instability for viscous flow KH instability is mainly a inviscid phenomenon where vortex sheet strength (tangential velocity jump across the vortex sheet) determines the instability frequency. Related term in viscous flows is the momentum thickness which involves τ w = μ δu/δy, velocity difference across the shear layer. Relevant velocity scaling would be the shear layer velocity. St θ =f KH θ/ U S is observed to be constant throughout a range of Re, but changes with geometry.\n16 Relevant scales for Strouhal number Karman instability. Due to interaction between two oppositely signed vortices. So, Relevant length scale would then be distance between the two separated shear layers. And, velocity scaling is shear layer velocity St U =f KH h/ U S = 0.08, found to be constant through both Re and geometry, thus termed universal Strouhal number\n17 Relevant scales for Strouhal number Flapping instability - change in reattachment length. So, relevant length scale would then be mean reattachment length And, velocity scaling is shear layer velocity Frequency scales with flow velocity and reattachment length (St R =f KH X R / U)\n20 Cases Only Karman – low Re flow past cylinders Both Karman and KH – High Re flow past cylinders, flow past blunt cylinders, backward facing steps. Only KH – flow past coves, slats, leading edge laminar separation bubble","Vortex Meters can be used for a wide range of fluids, i.e. liquids, gases and steam. They are to be seen as first choice, subject to verification to cover the requirements of a particular application.\nVortex meters are essentially frequency meters, since they measure the frequency of vortices generated by a “bluff body” or”shedder bar”. Vortices will only occur from a certain velocity (Re-number) on-wards, consequently vortex meters will have an elevated zero referred to as the “cut-off” point. Before the velocity becomes nil, the meter output will be cut to zero.\nAt a certain back-flow (above cut off point) some vortex meters could produce an output signal, which could lead to a false interpretation.\nAlso See: Vortex Flow Meter Animation\nVortex meters are actual volume flow meters, like orifice meters. These being intrusive meters like orifice meters, will cause the pressure drop as flow is increased, resulting in a permanent loss. consequently, liquids near their boiling point, could introduce cavitation as the pressure across the meter drops below the vapour pressure of the liquid. As soon as the pressure recovers above the vapour pressure the bubbles will impode. cavitation causes the meter to malfunction and should be avoided at all times.\nPrincipal – A fluid flowing with a certain velocity and passing a fixed obstruction generates vortices. The generation of vortices is known as Karman’s Vortices and culmination point of vortices will be approx. 1.2D downstream of bluff body. Strouhal discovered that as soon as a stretched wire starts vibrating in an air flow, frequency will be directly proportional to air velocity,\nSt= f*d/V0 (without dimention)\nSt= Strouhal’s number\nf=frequency of wire\nd=diameter of wire\nThis phenomena is called “vortex shedding” and the train of vortices is known as “Karman’s Vortex street”.\nThe frequency of vortex shedding is a direct linear function of fluid velocity and frequency depends upon the shape and face width of bluff body. Since the width of obstruction and inner diameter of the pipe will be more or less constant, the frequency is given by the expression-\nf= vortex frequency, Hz\nSt=strouhal’s number, dimention less\nV=Fluid velocity at the sheddar bar, m/s\nD=Inner diameter of the pipe, m\nc=constant (ratio d/D)\nd= Face width of sheddar bar, m\nThe pressure loss gradient across the vortex meter will have a similar shape to that of an orifice meter. the lowest point in pressure will be at the sheddar bar (comparable to vena contracta for orifice meter). downstream of this point of pressure will recover gradually, finally resulting in permanent pressure loss. To avoid cavitation, the pressure loss at vena-contracta is of interest.\nThe minimum back pressure required to ensure cavitation doesn’t occur is:\nPmin=3.2*Pdel + 1.25*Pv\nPmin= minimum required pressure at five pipe diameters downstream of the flow meter in bar\nPdel= calculated permanent pressure loss in bar\nPv= vapour pressure at operating temperature in bar\nRemember- for most vortex meters d/D will have range, 0.22 – 0.26, & frequency od vortices will depend on sizre of meter, larger the meter, lower the frequency. So the maximum diameter of vortex meter is restricted, because resolution of meter could become a problem.for control purposes. To overcome this problem, on-board digital multipliers are used which will multiply the vortex frequency without additional error.\nFrequency Sensing Principle –\nPiezo-electrical Sensors- a pair of piezo-electrical crystals is built into the sheddar bar. as the sheddar bar will be subject to alternating forces caused by shedding frequency, so will the piezo-crystals.\nVariable capacitance Sensors- a pair of variable capacitance sensors is built into the sheddar bar. As the sheddar bar will be subject to alternating micro movements caused by forces as a result of the shedding frequency, the capacitors will change their capacitance accordingly.\nPerformance of Vortex meters is influenced by-\nchange in sheddar bar geometry owning to erosion\nchange in sheddar bar geometry owning to deposits, i.e. Wax\ncorrosion of upstream piping\nchange in position of sheddar bar if not properly secured\nIn-general votex meter will consist of following electonics part-\npick-up elements, AC-pre amplifiers, AC-amplifier with filters, Noise abatement features, Schmitt Trigger, Microprocessor\nThe vortex shedding meter provides a linear digital (or analog) output signal without the use of separate transmitters or converters, simplifying equipment installation. Meter accuracy is good over a potentially wide flow range, although this range is dependent upon operating conditions. The shedding frequency is a function of the dimensions of the bluff body and, being a natural phenomenon, ensures good long term stability of calibration and repeatability of better than ±0.15% of rate. There is no drift because this is a frequency system.\nThe meter does have any moving or wearing components, providing improved reliability and reduced maintenance. Maintenance is further reduced by the fact that there are no valves or manifolds to cause leakage problems. The absence of valves or manifolds results in a particularly safe installation, an important consideration when the process fluid is hazardous or toxic.\nIf the sensor utilized is sufficiently sensitive, the same vortex shedding meter can be used on both gas and liquid. In addition, the calibration of the meter is virtually independent of the operating conditions (viscosity, density, pressure, temperature, and so on) whether the meter is being used on gas or liquid.\nThe vortex shedding meter also offers a low installed cost, particularly in pipe sizes below 6 in. (152 mm) diameter, which compares competitively with the installed cost of an orifice plate and differential pressure transmitter.\nThe limitation include meter size range. Meters below 0.5 in. (12 mm) diameter are not practical, and meters above 12 in. (300 mm) have limited application due their high cost compared to an orifice system and their limited output pulse resolution. The number of pulses generated per unit volume decreases on a cube law with increasing pipe diameter. Consequently, a 24 in. (610 mm) diameter vortex shedding meter with a typical blockage ratio of 0.3 would only have a full scale frequency output of approximately 5 Hz at 10 ft/s (3 m/s) fluid velocity.\nSelection and Sizing :\nAs the first step in the selection process, the operating conditions (process fluid temperature, ambient temperature, line pressure, and so on) should be compared with the meter specification. The meter wetted materials (including bonding agents) and sensors should then be checked for compatibility with the process fluid both with regard to chemical attack and safety. On oxygen, for example, non ferrous material should be used avoided or approached with extreme caution. The meter minimum and maximum flow rates for the given application should then be established.\nThe meter minimum flow rate is established by a Reynolds number of 10,000 to 10,500, the fluid density, and a minimum acceptable shedding frequency for the electronics. The maximum flow rate is governed by the meter pressure loss (typically two velocity heads), the onset of cavitation with liquids, and sonic velocity flow (choking) with gases. Consequently, the flow range for any application depends totally upon the operating fluid viscosity, density, and the vapour pressure, and the applications maximum flow rate and line pressure. On low viscosity products such as water, gasoline, and liquid ammonia, and with application maximum velocity of 15 ft/s (4.6 m/s), vortex shedding meters can have a rangeability of about 20:1 with a pressure loss of approximately 4 PSIG (27.4 kPa).\nThe meter’s good (“of rate”) accuracy and digital linear output signal make its application over wide flow ranges a practical proposition. The rangeability declines proportionally with increase in viscosity, decrease in density, or reductions in the maximum flow velocity of the process. Vortex shedding meters are therefore unsuitable for use on high viscosity liquids.\nVortex Meter Advantages\n• Vortex meters can be used for liquids, gases and steam\n• Low wear (relative to turbine flow meters)\n• Relatively low cost of installation and maintenance\n• Low sensitivity to variations in process conditions\n• Stable long term accuracy and repeatability\n• Applicable to a wide range of process temperatures\n• Available for a wide variety of pipe sizes\nVortex Flow Meter Limitations\n• Not suitable for very low flow rates\n• Minimum length of straight pipe is required upstream and downstream of the vortex meter\nVortex flow meters are suitable for a variety of applications and industries but work best with clean, low-viscosity, medium to high speed fluids.\nSome of the main uses include:\n• Custody transfer of natural gas metering\n• Steam measurement\n• Flow of liquid suspensions\n• General water applications\n• Liquid chemicals & pharmaceuticals\nAlso Read: Turbine Flow Meter Working Principle\n- Vortex Flow meter Working Animation\n- Difference between Different Types of Flow Meters\n- Types of Vortex Flow Meter Sensors\n- How to Select a Flow Meter\n- What is a Vortex flowmeter ?\n- V Cone Flow Meter Working Principle\n- Comparison of Venturi and Orifice flow meter\n- Swirl Flow Meters Working Principle\n- Flow Transmitter Rangeability\n- Flow Measurement Multiple Choice Questions"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c7b7913d-e103-4eb5-9888-3f88320c4d81>","<urn:uuid:62cb8005-b1b0-4130-923e-fcdbf2907b07>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does the concept of precedent in the US legal system work based on historical documents like the Federalist Papers?","answer":"According to Federalist 78, precedent was established to prevent arbitrary court decisions by binding judges to 'strict rules and precedents.' These precedents help define judges' duties in each case. However, Hamilton's writings suggest he was mainly referring to the interpretation of laws rather than the Constitution itself. This is evident in other Federalist Papers where Hamilton distinguishes between laws and the Constitution, such as in Federalist 82 where he states 'wherever there is an evident opposition, the laws ought to give place to the Constitution.'","context":["NewsWars | Nov 26, 2020 | 0\nJudicial Power to Deliberately Prolong a Misinterpretation of the Constitution Does Not Exist\nDuring his 2018 confirmation hearing, Justice Brett Kavanaugh correctly explained where the duty to follow judicial precedent comes from:\nPrecedent is not just a judicial policy. Precedent comes right from Article III of the Constitution. Article III refers to the “judicial power.” What does that mean? Precedent is rooted right into the Constitution itself….As I see it, the system of precedent comes from Article III itself. When Article III refers to the judicial power shall be vested in one Supreme Court and such inferior courts as Congress shall, from time to time, establish, to my mind, the phrase judicial power […] what does that entail? […] You look at the meaning—the meaning at the time of judicial power—and you look…one source of that is Federalist 78. It’s well explained that judges make decisions based on precedent, and precedent, therefore, has constitutional origins and constitutional basis in the text of the Constitution.\nSo let’s consider Federalist 78. Here’s what Hamilton wrote there:\nTo avoid an arbitrary discretion in the courts, it is indispensable that they should be bound down by strict rules and precedents, which serve to define and point out their duty in every particular case that comes before them; and it will readily be conceived from the variety of controversies which grow out of the folly and wickedness of mankind, that the records of those precedents must unavoidably swell to a very considerable bulk, and must demand long and laborious study to acquire a competent knowledge of them. of those precedents must unavoidably swell to a very considerable bulk, and must demand long and laborious study to acquire a competent knowledge of them. Hence it is, that there can be but few men in the society who will have sufficient skill in the laws to qualify them for the stations of judges.\nThat last sentence shows Hamilton was speaking about following previous interpretations of “the laws,” without referring to or singling out the Constitution. It is very possible that Hamilton was focused in Federalist 78 exclusively on statutes, because elsewhere (e.g. in Federalist 80) Hamilton contrasted the laws with the Constitution, when he asked “What equitable causes can grow out of the Constitution and laws of the United States?“ See also Federalist 82: “wherever there is an evident opposition, the laws ought to give place to the Constitution.”\nEven putting aside Hamilton’s position on the necessity of following statutory or constitutional precedents, the founders were unanimously clear about constitutional stare decisis in the text of the Constitution itself. An ancient rule for reading legal texts is the Harmonious-Reading Canon, which says that the clauses in a legal text should be interpreted in a way that renders them compatible, not contradictory. Justice Kavanaugh was correct that the duty to follow precedents comes from the Judicial Vesting Clause in Article III, Section I. But that clause should not be interpreted in a way that conflicts with any other clause. For example, if a non-originalist Supreme Court erroneously interprets the word “press” in the First Amendment to ensure a right to go to the gym and bench “press” during a pandemic, but subsequently the Court realizes its mistaken interpretation of the word “press,” then the Court is obligated to adhere to the true meaning of the First Amendment. Otherwise, they would be inflating the judicial power in a way that conflicts with the First Amendment. This is why I believe the Court was entirely correct in Smith v. Allwright, 321 U.S. 649 (1944):[W]e are not unmindful of the desirability of continuity of decision in constitutional questions. However, when convinced of former error, this Court has never felt constrained to follow precedent. In constitutional questions, where correction depends upon amendment and not upon legislative action this Court throughout its history has freely exercised its power to reexamine the basis of its constitutional decisions. This has long been accepted practice, and this practice has continued to this day.\nToo bad the Court has seen fit to backtrack from this core principle. The Court has cited various policy reasons for doing so, but they cannot defeat the constitutional command that relies upon the Harmonious-Reading Canon. Moreover, those policy reasons are flawed, because the greatest policy danger is that the Court (or some of its members) will be tempted toward casual misinterpretations of the Constitution in the belief that they will be protected in perpetuity by stare decisis. In the field of constitutional law, where the doctrine of precedent is weak, the necessity of binding down judges can only be accomplished via originalism, and so the argument for applying originalism in constitutional interpretation is even greater than the already-strong case for doing so in statutory interpretation.\nNOTE: This post was originally published at The Originalism Blog, “The Blog of the Center for the Study of Constitutional Originalism at the University of San Diego School of Law,” and is reposted here with permission from the author.\nThis post has been republished with permission from a publicly-available RSS feed found on Tenth Amendment Center.

At the White Temple in Thailand, artistic elements include murals featuring both traditional Buddhist imagery and modern pop culture references, painted under the direction of artist Chalermchai Kositpipat. The temple also features architectural art in the form of white structures with embedded glass, and symbolic artistic elements such as hands reaching from a pit representing worldly desires.","context":["Sitara Recital, a Morning Concert held at city’s proud Monument Buddha Statue in Hussain Sagar lake on Sunday\nIt’s a wonderful experiment and hope it will be continued: Jayesh Ranjan, Principle Secretary, Govt of Telangana.\nHyderabad, December 13, 2021: First time ever in the history of Hyderabad city, a morning public concert ‘Shubhodayam’ held in Hussain Sagar Lake Near Buddha Statue to give music lovers a unique experience.\n230 plus music lovers witnessed the concert some of whom include Mrs and Mr Jayesh Ranjan, Principal Secretary, Govt of Telangana; Mr Anjaneyulu, General Manager, Tourism Department.\nSpeaking on the occasion Mr Jayesh Ranjan said, there are no words left to describe my experience.

Ancient Meets Modern in the White Temple of Thailand\nWhen the rebirth of an ancient building is assumed by a modern thinking artist, strange elements might appear. This is what has happened at the site of Wat Rong Khun, now the White Temple, Thailand. The Thai artist in question, Chalermchai Kositpipat, includes amongst the more traditional Buddhist symbolism, some images from the modern world, such as The Terminator, Michael Jackson and Harry Potter. The resulting work-in-progress is an absolutely fascinating creation.\nThe White Temple is a Buddhist temple complex located in Chiang Rai, a city in the northern part of Thailand. The construction of the current complex only began around the end of the 20 th century, after the original temple was completely demolished. Whilst the White Temple is not yet complete, it has already become a tourist destination, due to its uniqueness and difference from most of the other Buddhist temples in Thailand.\nThe Saviour of Wat Rong Khun\nThe original White Temple, also known as Wat Rong Khun, was in a decrepit state as the 20 th century neared its end. Whilst restoration works began in order to save the temple, they had to be stopped as a result of a shortage of funds. This temple was ‘rescued’ in a way, when Chalermchai Kositpipat, a local artist, decided to demolish the old structure, and to build a new one in its place, with funds for the project coming out of his own pocket. Kositpipat is perhaps best known for heading the team of Thai artists who painted the walls of the Wat Buddhapadipa, the first Thai Buddhist temple in the UK, which was constructed in Wimbledon in 1982. His murals in that temple are somewhat controversial, as they contain images of secular figures, including Muammar Gaddafi, Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Regan, in that sacred space.\nThai artist Chalermchai Kositpipat at Wat Rong Khun in Chiang Rai, Thailand. © BrokenSphere / Wikimedia Commons ( CC BY-SA 3.0 )\nAn Unorthodox Blend of Modern and Traditional Symbolism\nKositpipat’s unique style of blending the sacred and the profane is also seen in the White Temple, but a little bit more of that in a moment. Apart from its murals, the White Temple contains other elements which are rich in meaning and symbolism. First of all, the ubosot (or ordination hall), which is the most important building in the temple, is entirely white in colour, with fragments of reflective glass embedded in the plaster. The white colour of the ubosot is meant to represent the purity of the Buddha, whilst the glass is meant to symbolise his wisdom.\n- The magnificent ancient Buddhist Temple of Borobudur\n- The Powerful Past of the Former Siamese Capital Revealed in the Splendor of 400 Temples\n- Magnificent Tham Lod Cave Sheds Light on Earliest Humans in Thailand\nClassical, three-tiered roof of the all-white ubosot ( Public Domain )\nIn terms of architectural design, the ubosot contains some classical elements from Northern Thai temples, including its three-tiered roof, as well as the stylised Nagas on the barge boards. On the back wall of the ubosot, one will find a golden mural of the Buddha, and several more images of him in front of it. In addition, it is within this hall that Kositpipat’s distinct style can be seen. Apart from images of the Buddha, this hall also contains a mural depicting well-known figures, both real and fictional, including Michael Jackson, Harry Potter and the Terminator. Other elements in this mural include spaceships, an oil pump, and the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center. The melange of images makes it difficult to provide a definitive interpretation of the mural, though in general, it is meant to symbolise the struggle between Good and Evil.\n- Wat Tilok Aram: The 500-Year-Old Underwater Temple of Thailand\n- Locals in Thailand Village Claim Black Magic Tattoos Helped Preserve the Skin of a Corpse\n- Ten Magnificent Ancient Structures of Asia\nThe Path to the Ubosot\nAnother feature of the temple complex worth mentioning is the bridge leading to the ubosot, which is known as the Bridge of the Cycle of Rebirth. In front of this bridge is a circular area containing many hands reaching out of the pit. These are meant to symbolise a person’s worldly desires, such as greed and lust, which one would need to overcome in order to achieve enlightenment. After this bridge is crossed, one reaches the Gate of Heaven, which is guarded by two figures representing Death and Rahu. After these are a few images of the Buddha in meditation, after which one would reach the ubosot.\nThe bridge of \"The Cycle of Rebirth\", White Temple, Thailand ( CC BY-SA 4.0 )\nTo date, the White Temple has still not been completed. If all goes according to plan, the temple complex will eventually contain nine different buildings, including the ubosot, a hall to house Buddhist relics, a meditation hall, and even an art gallery. For this project, Kositpipat is aided by over 60 volunteers. Nevertheless, it is estimated that it would take another 60 or 70 years before the temple complex is completed.\nTop image: A photo of the White Temple, Chang Rai, Thailand ( CC BY SA 3.0 ).\nBy: Wu Mingren\nAlex, 2013.

{"question":"What is the traditional portrayal of the Ubume in Japanese folklore, and how does it relate to modern environmental concerns about tropical deforestation?","answer":"The Ubume is traditionally portrayed in Japanese folklore as a supernatural entity that appears as an old woman carrying a child, asking passersby to hold her infant. When someone takes the swaddled baby, it becomes increasingly heavy until it's revealed to be a boulder or stone image of Jizo. The Ubume is also described as a ghost of a woman who died in childbirth, appearing bloody from the waist down. This folklore has no direct relation to tropical deforestation, which is a significant environmental issue accounting for about 10 percent of the world's global warming emissions and threatens tropical forests that provide over 20 percent of the planet's oxygen while storing greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide.","context":["Ubume (産女?), a Japanese yōkai, appears in folk stories and literature as an old woman or Crone, with a child in her arms, imploring the passerby to hold her infant, only to then disappear. As legend has it, the weight of the child increases by degrees, until the bewitched “child” is revealed to be nothing more than a huge rock or boulder. The first version of this sort of tale was related by Urabe Suyetake, servant of Raiko.\nUbume in folklore\nTypically, the Ubume asks a passerby to hold her child for just a moment and disappears when her victim takes the swaddled baby. The baby then becomes increasingly heavy until it is impossible to hold. It is then revealed not to be a human child at all, but a boulder or a stone image of Jizo.\nThe Shoshin’in Temple, according to scholars, is where local women come to pray to conceive a child or to have a successful pregnancy. According to Stone and Walter (2008), the origins of the temple’s legend, set in the mid-sixteenth century, concern:\n- ... a modern statue of Ubume, displayed once a year in July. At this festival, candy that has been offered to the image is distributed, and women pray for safe delivery and for abundant milk. The statue, which is clothed in white robes, has only a head, torso, and arms; it has no lower half.\nUbume in literature\nStories about Ubume have been told in Japan since at least the twelfth century.\n- When a woman loses her life in childbirth, her spiritual attachment (shūjaku) itself becomes this ghost. In form, it is soaked in blood from the waist down and wanders about crying, ‘Be born! Be born!’ (obareu, obareu).\nNatsuhiko Kyogoku’s best-selling detective novel, The Summer of the Ubume, uses the Ubume legend as its central motif, creating something of an Ubume 'craze' at the time of its publication and was made into a major motion picture in 2005.\nUbume in art\n- Iwasaka, Michiko and Barre Toelken.

{"question":"How should patients care for themselves during brain metastases radiation treatment?","answer":"During brain metastases radiation treatment, patients should get as much rest as possible and maintain a balanced diet. The treated area requires special care: avoid sun exposure and hot/cold packs, clean the area with warm water and mild shampoo like baby shampoo, and only use lotions after consulting with medical staff. It's important to inform doctors about any medications or vitamins being taken. Patients should ask their doctor if driving is safe. Getting support from family and friends or joining support groups can help cope with treatment. Patients should actively communicate with their treatment team about any concerns or questions they have.","context":["Brain Metastases (Brain Cancer)\n[youtube width=89% height=505 list=random]Brain Mets[/youtube]\nWhat are Brain Metastases?\n- Brain metastases are clusters of malignant or cancerous cells that have spread from another part of the body to the brain.\n- About 170,000 people will be diagnosed with brain metastases this year making it more common than many primary cancers, such as primary brain tumors (42,000 cases), lymphoma (75,000) or colon cancer (106,000).\n- It is common to say a person has “brain cancer” when the cancer has spread to the brain from another part of the body. However, in most cases brain metastases represent spread of the original cancer through the blood stream to the brain. So instead of having both brain cancer and breast cancer, for example, a person has breast cancer that has spread to the brain.\n- The most common cancers that spread to the brain are lung cancer, breast cancer and melanoma. However, just about any cancer can spread to the brain.\n- Cancer treatments have become much better in recent years, allowing many patients to live longer with the disease than ever before. Unfortunately, brain metastases still occur in many patients sometimes months or even years after their original cancer treatment. There are many treatment options available for patients with brain metastases.\nSigns and Symptoms of brain metastases\n- Sometimes you have no obvious symptoms or signs that the cancer has spread to the brain. Rather, you may come in for a routine follow-up visit and the cancer is found during exams or on imaging scans.\n- Possible common symptoms include headaches, dizziness, blurred or double vision, memory and/or personality changes, speech changes, or nausea.\n- Sometimes changes in nerve function causing numbness, weakness of part of your body or problems with balance can also occur.\n- If you begin to have these symptoms, call your doctor. These symptoms can also indicate other health issues that may need quick medical attention.\nTreating Brain Metastases?\n- Treatment for brain metastases can control symptoms and improve quality of life. In some cases these treatments can also help you live longer with your cancer.\n- Surgery for brain metastases can sometimes help by managing symptoms, such as relieving pressure in the brain. Surgery also helps doctors confirm that the tumors in the brain are really brain metastases. Surgery is often considered if you have a single brain metastasis.\n- Chemotherapy is when doctors give medication to kill the cancer cells. Traditionally, chemotherapy has a limited role in treating brain metastases due to the “blood-brain barrier,” which restricts what can travel from the blood into the brain. This protective barrier prevents many chemotherapy drugs from entering the brain. However, newer drugs may be able to pass through this blood brain barrier to help control the brain metastases.\n- Radiation therapy (also called radiotherapy) is effective for treating some brain metastases. Unlike chemotherapy, radiation therapy’s effectiveness is not limited by the blood brain barrier and can penetrate the brain to kill cancer cells.\n- In most cases, patients with metastases will not be “cured” of their cancer. However, modern treatments including radiation therapy allow doctors to control the brain metastases, allowing many patients with cancer that has spread to live months to years longer with their cancer. This time will depend on where the original cancer came from, where else it has spread and how well it responds to treatments rather than on the actual number of brain metastases.\n- You may be prescribed a medication called a steroid to lessen or prevent symptoms. This is sometimes given before treatment starts.\nWhat is radiation therapy?\n- Radiation therapy is the use of various types of radiation to safely and effectively treat cancer and other diseases.\n- Doctors called radiation oncologists use radiation therapy to kill tumors, to control tumor growth and to relieve symptoms.\n- Radiation therapy works by damaging the genetic material or other critical components of cancer cells. This limits their ability to reproduce. Radiation can sometimes stop the blood supply to cancers, which also kills the cancer cells. When these cancer cells die, the body naturally eliminates them.\n- Normal cells are also affected by radiation, but they are better able to repair the damage caused by radiation therapy than can most cancer cells.\n- Treatments are noninvasive and painless, much like receiving an X-ray. You should be able to go home after treatment and will not need to stay in the clinic.\nUnderstanding external beam radiation therapy for brain metastases\n- External beam radiation therapy may involve a series of outpatient treatments to accurately deliver radiation therapy to the whole brain.\n- Sometimes the whole brain is given radiation, sometimes only a limited area. When the whole brain needs radiation treatments for brain metastases, treatments are usually given daily Monday through Friday for two to three weeks.\n- In some cases, a single high dose radiation treatment called stereotactic radiosurgery can be used so treatment is completed in one to five days. With stereotactic radiosurgery doctors only target a small part of the brain. Sometimes combining both stereotactic radiosurgery with whole brain radiation therapy can be helpful.\n- Before starting radiation, you will undergo a radiation “planning” session where the radiation treatment team creates a way to set your treatments up accurately on a day-to-day basis, generally with a custom fit mesh mask. However, sometimes other devices are used to help with accuracy of daily set up. You then undergo imaging in the treatment position, typically with a CT scan or fluoroscopy. The radiation oncologist then works with his or her treatment team to “prescribe” the radiation treatment.\n- Tailoring each of the radiation beams allows doctors to target more of the cancer cells while sparing nearby organs, such as the eyes.\nPossible side effects\n- If you notice a funny whole body skin tingling or rash, contact your doctor right away. This may be a sign of an allergic reaction to medications given before radiation therapy for brain tumors.\n- Fatigue is the most common side effect. Feeling tired often starts in the middle of the treatment and may last several weeks after your last radiation session.\n- Radiation therapy to the brain can cause scalp irritation and muffled hearing.\n- It is normal for you to lose the hair on their head where the radiation beams were aimed. It will probably grow back, but it may not be exactly as it was before treatment.\n- Radiation may cause some short-term memory loss. Ask your radiation oncologist about what you can expect and what the risks and benefits of each treatment are.\n- Side effects are different for everyone. The radiation oncologist and nurse will follow you closely during treatment and ask you and your family members about any symptoms. Medications may be prescribed to make you more comfortable.\n- Please do not delay in talking to a radiation oncologist or oncology nurse about any side effects or concerns about treatments.

You may want to consider asking your doctor or nurse about support groups in your area that may also help.\n- It is important to follow the doctor’s orders and ask a lot of questions. There are no silly questions; often the treatment team has heard similar questions.\n- You and your family should ask the doctor if it’s safe for you to drive.\n- It is important to tell your doctor about any medications or vitamins you are taking to make sure they are safe to use during radiation therapy.\n- Try to eat a balanced diet. The doctor, nurse or dietician can help suggests foods if you are having trouble eating or if food tastes funny.\n- The area exposed to radiation must be treated with special care. This includes staying out of the sun, avoiding hot and cold packs, cleaning the area with warm water and mild shampoo (such as baby shampoo), and using lotions and ointments only after checking with your doctor or nurse."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"opinion_recommendation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a85f8a64-4844-4374-8a86-88449bf53d7e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the survival rates for stage 1 bowel cancer compared to stage 1 skin cancer basal cell carcinoma?","answer":"Stage 1 bowel cancer (Dukes' A) has a survival rate of more than 93% after 5 years. For basal cell carcinoma, which is the most prevalent type of skin cancer, the chance of recovery after early diagnosis is 95%. Both cancers have excellent survival rates when caught early.","context":["8 myths on your skin and the sun\nWhen it comes to tanning, there are a lot of myths doing the rounds. So what is the truth about your skin and the sun?\nI feel so healthy after tanning; surely the sun can't be as bad as everyone makes out?\nSome of the sunniest places on earth, such as Australia, Texas and South Africa, also have the highest incidence of skin cancer.\nOnly people with fair skin and blue eyes are at risk.\nNew research on the effect of UV-rays gives cause for real concern for both light and darker skinned people. Although people with light or red hair and blue eyes are at higher risk, the incidence of skin cancer is increasing among people with black and brown skins.\nI have been sun-safe the past decade, so I have no risk of developing skin cancer.\nIt now appears that sun damage to the skin is cumulative, and damage caused during the first 15 years of life may only become apparent years later.\nI already have a nice tan, so my skin is used to the sun. It won’t damage as easily.\nBenign freckles and sunspots may need only one extra exposure to the sun to become malignant.\nA little sun is good for my baby or toddler.\nChildren can suffer skin damage within seven minutes of sun exposure between 11 am and 3 pm.\nSunbeds and tanning lamps are safe.\nThey emit UV-A and are unsafe. UV-A rays can penetrate into the deeper layers of the skin, causing damage even before your skin turns red. UV-A rays make skin tough and wrinkled and increase the risk of skin cancer.\nA skin cancer lesion will bleed, be red in appearance and painful. I will be aware of it from the moment the cancer starts.\nMost cancer lesions are not associated with bleeding, scab formation or pain. The changes in a lesion can be very subtle. If one does not watch out for changes, it may go unnoticed for weeks and months, decreasing your chances of survival. Contact your dermatologist if a lesion:\n- Changes colour: from light to dark or white to pale pink\n- Changes shape and size\n- Develops irregular, swollen ridges\n- Peels, heals and peels again\n- Forms an ulcer in the centre and doesn’t heal\n- Suddenly reappears\nThere is no need to rush to my doctor when I detect a suspicious lesion.\nEarly detection and treatment is vital and can save your life.\nThe three types of skin cancer and what they mean\n1. Basal cell carcinoma\nThis is the most prevalent type of skin cancer.\nIt does not usually spread to other organs or parts of the body.\nThe chance of recovery after an early diagnosis is 95 percent.\n2. Squamous cell carcinoma\nEasy to cure, provided it is diagnosed at an early stage.\nIf not diagnosed early, it tends to spread to the lymphatic system and other tissue cells, requiring the removal of lymph glands.\nAbout 5 – 10 percent of all skin cancers are melanomas.\nIt is very aggressive and can spread to other tissue cells at an early stage.\nThe chances of recovery depend on how deeply the lesion has penetrated the skin. In cases where the penetration is less than 0.75 mm, the chance of recovery is excellent. With a lesion deeper than 4 mm, the chance of surviving ten years or longer is less than 15 percent.\nMelanoma is the fourth most common cancer diagnosed in Australia1, which along with New Zealand has the world's highest incidence rate for melanoma.\n- Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (AIHW) 2012.

You can find the following information\nStatistics and outlook for bowel cancer\nOutlook is also called prognosis and means your chances of getting better. With bowel cancer the likely outcome depends on how advanced the cancer is when it is diagnosed.\nLower down this page we have quite detailed information about the likely outcome of different stages of bowel cancer. The statistics we use are taken from a variety of sources, including the opinions and experiences of the experts who check our information. The statistics are intended as a general guide only. For the more complete picture in your case, you’d have to speak to your own specialist. We include statistics because people ask for them, but not everyone wants to read this type of information.\nHow reliable are cancer statistics?\nNo statistics can tell you what will happen to you. Your cancer is unique. The same type of cancer can grow at different rates in different people. The statistics cannot tell you about the different treatments people may have had, or how that treatment may have affected their prognosis. There are many individual factors that will affect your treatment and your outlook.\nYou can view and print the quick guides for all the pages in the treating bowel cancer section.\nThis page contains quite detailed information about the survival rates of different stages of bowel cancer. We have included it because many people have asked us for this. But not everyone who is diagnosed with a cancer wants to read this type of information. If you are not sure whether you want to know at the moment or not, then perhaps you might like to skip this page for now. You can always come back to it.\nPlease note that no national statistics are available for different stages of cancer or treatments that people may have had. The statistics we present here are pulled together from a variety of different sources, including the opinions and experience of the experts who check our information. We give statistics because people ask us for them. But they are only intended as a general guide and cannot tell you about your individual outcome.\nWe have another section explaining about cancer statistics and also about incidence, mortality and survival. Unless you are very familiar with medical statistics it might help to read this before you read the statistics below.\nRemember that 5 year survival and 10 year survival are terms that doctors use. This doesn't mean you will only live 5 or 10 years. 10 year survival relates to the number of people in research studies who were still alive 10 years after diagnosis. Doctors follow what happens to people for 10 years or more after treatment in cancer research studies. This is because there is only a small chance that a cancer will come back more than 10 years after treatment. They do not like to say these people are cured because there is that small chance. So they use the term 10 year survival instead.\nAs with many other types of cancer, the outcome of colon or rectal cancer depends on how advanced it is when it is diagnosed. In other words, the stage of your cancer. The outlook for people with bowel cancer has improved a lot over the past 40 years.\nOf all the people in England diagnosed with colon or rectal cancer, about 55 out of every 100 (55%) live for at least 5 years after their diagnosis. Recent estimates show that about 50 out of every 100 people with rectal or colon cancer (50%) live for at least 10 years.\nThe statistics below relate to people having surgery. About 80 out of every 100 people with colorectal cancer (80%) have surgery intended to cure them. But the cancer comes back in up to half of these people.\nThe links below take you down the page to specific information about the outlook for each stage of bowel cancer. We don't know the stage for about 34 out of every 100 people (34%) at the time they are diagnosed with bowel cancer.\nStage 1 bowel cancer is also called Dukes' A. As this is a very early stage cancer it has a high cure rate. After surgery more than 9 out of 10 patients (93%) will live for more than 5 years. Unfortunately, at the moment fewer than 9 out of every 100 patients (9%) diagnosed with colorectal cancer have stage 1. As bowel cancer screening has been introduced across the UK, we hope that more people will have their cancer diagnosed early.\nStage 2 bowel cancer is also called Dukes' B. About a quarter (24%) of people with colorectal cancer are diagnosed at this stage. Depending on various factors, after surgery more than three quarters (up to 77%) of people with stage 2 colorectal cancer can expect to live longer than 5 years.\nStage 3 bowel cancer is also called Dukes' C. Roughly 23 out of every 100 people (23%) with colorectal cancer are diagnosed at this stage. The outcome depends on the number of lymph nodes that contain cancer cells. After surgery almost half of those with Stage 3 bowel cancer (48%) will live for at least 5 years.\nStage 4 bowel cancer is also sometimes called Dukes' D. In roughly 9 out of every 100 people (9%) with colorectal cancer, the cancer has already spread to another part of their body when they are diagnosed. For this advanced cancer the survival rates are lower. Only about 6 people out of every 100 (6%) will live for at least 5 years after they are diagnosed. But if the cancer has spread into the liver and the areas in the liver can be removed with surgery, some recent studies have shown 5 year survival rates of 25 to 40%.\nNo statistics can tell you what will happen to you. Your cancer is unique. So statistics can only give a rough idea of what may happen to you. The available statistics are not detailed enough to tell you about the different treatments people may have had. They also can't tell how that treatment may have affected their outlook. Some treatments may help people to live longer as well as relieving symptoms. There are many individual factors that will affect your treatment and prognosis.\nTaking part in clinical trials can help to improve the outlook for people in the future. If you are interested in taking part in a clinical trial, talk to your cancer specialist. We have information about clinical trials in the trials and research section. And you can search for UK trials on our trials database.

{"question":"What are the key chemical differences between nitrosation and nitrosylation reactions, and how do their environmental conditions affect their occurrence in food processing?","answer":"Nitrosation and nitrosylation differ in their chemical mechanisms and conditions. Nitrosation involves adding a nitrosonium ion (NO+) to an amine (–NH2) forming a nitrosamine, occurring in acidic conditions like the stomach. Nitrosylation involves adding a nitrosyl ion (NO−) to a metal or thiol, forming nitrosyl iron or S-nitrosothiols. In cured meat (pH ~5), nitrosylation is favored, especially with sodium ascorbate present, leading to beneficial nitrosylheme formation. In contrast, stomach conditions (pH 2) promote nitrosation, potentially forming carcinogenic nitrosamines.","context":["Fashion 15 Pulgadas A De Kazim Travel De Black 6 Mochila D223a Negro Negro Black De Viaje Backpack Kazim 15 Portátil Un Bag D223a Cabe Inch 6 Fits Bolsa Moda TnqTvHZr\nNitroso refers to a functional group in organic chemistry which has the NO group attached to an organic moiety.

Nitrosoarenes typically participate in a monomer-dimer equilibrium. The dimers, which are often pale-yellow, are often favored in the solid state, whereas the deeply colored monomers are favored in dilution solution or at higher temperatures. They exist as cis- and trans-isomers.\nNitroso compounds can be prepared by the reduction of nitro compounds or by the oxidation of hydroxylamines. A good example is (CH3)3CNO, known formally as 2-methyl-2-nitrosopropane, or t-BuNO. (CH3)6 Cabe Pulgadas Negro Bolsa De 15 Viaje Fashion De 6 Kazim Moda De Portátil D223a Negro Un Bag Fits Black Travel D223a Inch 15 Kazim A Black Mochila Backpack 3CNO is blue and exists in solution in equilibrium with its dimer, which is colorless, m.p. 80–81 °C.\nIn the Brigid Boss Boss Black Hobo Hobo Brigid Black Boss Bag Bag Brigid Hobo Bag Black Brigid Oz4ww70qd aromatic 4-nitrosoanilines are prepared from the corresponding nitrosamines. Another named reaction involving a nitroso compound is the Barton reaction.\nOrganonitroso compounds serve as a ligands for transition metals.\nDue to the stability of the nitric oxide free radical, nitroso organyls tend to have very low C–N bond dissociation energies: nitrosoalkanes have BDEs on the order of 30 to 40 kcal/mol, while nitrosoarenes have BDEs on the order of 50 to 60 kcal/mol. As a consequence, they are generally heat- and light-sensitive. Compounds containing O–(NO) or N–(NO) bonds generally have even lower bond dissociation energies. For instance, N-nitrosodiphenylamine, Ph2N–N=O, has a N–N bond dissociation energy of only 23 kcal/mol.\nNitrosation vs. nitrosylation\nNitrite can enter two kinds of reaction, depending on the physico-chemical environment.\n- Nitrosylation is adding a nitrosyl ion NO− to a metal (e.g. iron) or a thiol, leading to nitrosyl iron Fe–NO (e.g., in nitrosylated heme = nitrosylheme) or S-nitrosothiols (RSNOs).\n- Nitrosation is adding a nitrosonium ion NO+ to an amine –NH2 leading to a nitrosamine. This conversion occurs at acidic pH, particularly in the stomach, as shown in the equation for the formation of N-phenylnitrosamine:\n2Woman Black Tooky Polyurethane Backpack Bag t7nvYz + H + ⇌ HONO\n- HONO + H + ⇌ H 2O + NO +\n- C 6H 5NH 2 + NO + → C 6H 5N(H)NO + H +\nMany primary alkyl N-nitroso compounds, such as CH3N(H)NO, tend to be unstable with respect to hydrolysis to the alcohol. Those derived from secondary amines (e.g., (CH3)2NNO derived from dimethylamine) are more robust. It is these N-nitrosamines that are carcinogens in rodents.\nNitrosyl in inorganic chemistry\nNitrosyls are non-organic compounds containing the NO group, for example directly bound to the metal via the N atom, giving a metal–NO moiety. Alternatively, a nonmetal example is the common reagent nitrosyl chloride (Cl−N=O). Nitric oxide is a stable radical, having an unpaired electron. Reduction of nitric oxide gives the hyponitrite anion, NO−:\n- NO + e − → NO −\n- NO → NO + + e −\nIn foodstuffs and in the gastro-intestinal tract, nitrosation and nitrosylation do not have the same consequences on consumer health.\n- In cured meat: Meat processed by curing contains nitrite and has a pH of 5 approximately, where almost all nitrite is present as NO−\n2 (99%). Cured meat is also added with sodium ascorbate (or erythorbate or vitamin C). As demonstrated by S. Mirvish, ascorbate inhibits nitrosation of amines to nitrosamine, because ascorbate reacts with NO−\nPortátil A Travel Inch Moda Kazim De Fashion Black Kazim 6 Bolsa 6 Fits Cabe Negro De Backpack Bag Pulgadas D223a Mochila De Viaje Black D223a 15 Negro 15 Un 2 to form NO. Ascorbate and pH 5 thus favor nitrosylation of heme iron, forming nitrosylheme, a red pigment when included inside myoglobin, and a pink pigment when it has been released by cooking. It participates to the \"bacon flavor\" of cured meat: nitrosylheme is thus considered a benefit for the meat industry and for consumers.\n- In the stomach: secreted Hydrogen Chloride makes an acidic environment (pH=2) and ingested nitrite (with food or saliva) leads to nitrosation of amines, that yields nitrosamines (potential carcinogens). Nitrosation is low if amine concentration is low (e.g., low-protein diet, no fermented food) or if vitamin C concentration is high (e.g., high fruit diet). Then S-nitrosothiols are formed, that are stable at pH 2.\n- In the colon: neutral pH does not favor nitrosation. No nitrosamine is formed in stools, even after addition of a secondary amine or nitrite. Neutral pH favors NO− release from S-nitrosothiols, and nitrosylation of iron. The previously called NOC (N-nitroso compounds) measured by Bingham's team in stools from red meat-fed volunteers were, according to Bingham and Kuhnle, largely non-N-nitroso ATNC (apparent total nitroso compounds), e.g., S-nitrosothiols and nitrosyl iron (as nitrosyl heme).\n- Cm For skin Passion 25 Women Leather Handbag Komal 4 T8zqnBtT1, the functional group with the NO attached to an amine, such as R2N–NO\n- Nitric oxide\n- G.

First its the Joux Plane which starts at Morzine. This is a famous climb of the Tour de France. Not too tough from the Morzine side it takes us through pastures and forests to a ski resort at the summit. A coffee at the lake and then an awesome descent to Samoens. From here its a valley run to the next short climb to the Col du Chatillon. Our real target though is the Colombiere and we get there via the Col de Romme. Today is a testing day on the bike. Remember its not a race and the scenery is stunning.\n21 July 2019\nLa Clusaz to Seez – Ride distance 99.6km and altitude gain 3290m\nGet a good rest because today is another epic day. The day comprises:\n- The steady climb of the Aravis with amazing views of the Massif . We are dwarfed by rock. A long descent takes us to Flumet where the coffee shop overlooking the river will stop us momentarily.\n- Then its the Saisies. Another steady climb to a ski resort. Again picture perfect scenery to keep you entertained.\n- Our climb of the day is another icon of the tour, the Cormet de Roselend. It is a beautiful climb that has it all. Following the river up the valley. Through a forest. Lots of switchbacks. Emerging from the forest the views are amazing back to Beaufort. Then its on to the lake at what appears to be the summit but we still have some way to go before the victory photos.\n- The descent to Bourg Saint Maurice is another favorite. Makes the climb worthwhile! Now its just a matter of getting to our hotel which sits part way up the Col du Petit Saint Bernard.\n22 July 2019\nSeez to St Michelle de Maurienne – Ride distance 118.35km and altitude gain 2540m\nToday the climb is the Iseran. This is another classic tour climb. We climb nearly all of its length. Technically the climb starts at Bourg Saint Maurice. We have already got a start on the climb so we get to descend through some typical mountainside villages till we pick up the climb. It is a long climb and it takes us to the highest pass in Europe at 2774m.

From the air, the road is instantly recognisable – as is its relentless turns and gradient when you are travelling up it or watching a race unfold on its slopes.\nAlthough Alpe d’Huez is a regular fixture of the Tour de France now, it wasn’t used in the race until 1952, providing the location of the Tour’s first ever summit finish. It’s hard to believe that it wasn’t branded a success by the race’ organiser at the time – the sea of spectators spilling onto the road that we are used to seeing now did not exist.\nThe climb wasn’t used by the Tour again until 1976, when both the sport and the resort had rapidly developed. Since then, the climb has made Tour champions, and broken the hearts and bodies of many others – and not just racers. The climb has become a ‘must do’ ascent for cyclists, and is a mecca for bike-bound pilgrims every year when the snow melts away.\nAlpe d’Huez stats\nLocation: Alps, France\nAverage gradient: 8.1 per cent, steepest part 11.5 per cent\nMaximum elevation: 1850 metres\nFastest recorded ascent: 37 minutes and 35 seconds by Marco Pantani during 1997 Tour de France\nAlpe d’Huez photos\nBernard Hinault looking in control on Alpe d’Huez during the 1981 Tour. Although he won overall by a sizeable margin, the stage to Alpe d’Huez was taken by Peter Winnen, who would eventually place fifth behind Hinault.\nScotsman Robert Millar paces Z team-mate Ronan Pensec up Alpe d’Huez during the 1990 Tour de France. Gianni Bugno won the stage. Despite Millar’s efforts in the Alps, Pensec would lose the race lead to Claudio Chiappucci after the following day’s time trial\nGreg LeMond on the Alpe during stage 17 of the 1989 Tour de France. The stage was won by Gert-Jan Theunisse, and LeMond would lose the race lead to Laurent Fignon before sensationally snatching it back on the final stage in Paris.\nMarco Pantani, Richard Virenque and Jan Ullrich fight it out on stage 13 of the 1997 Tour. Pantani would win the stage, and Ullrich would go on to win the race for the only time in his career with Virenque claiming the King of the Mountains title. All three riders would later be embroiled in doping scandals.\nPierre Rolland became the first Frenchman in 25 years to win atop Alpe d’Huez when he won stage 19 of the 2011 Tour de France. Rolland was born three months after Hinault’s win in 1986, and was released from domestique duties by team leader Thomas Voeckler to take a famous stage win.\nThibaut Pinot won Tour de France’s most recent visit to Alpe d’Huez in 2015, taking a spectacular solo victory on stage 20 after dropping out of GC contention early in the race.\nThe most recent winner of a bike race into Alpe d’Huez was Team Sky’s Peter Kennaugh, who won stage seven of the 2017 Critérium du Dauphiné. However this stage entered the ski resort via the back road, climbing the hors-categorie Col de Sarenne before a short second category climb into the town itself.\nAlpe d’Huez Strava segment\nTour de France stage winners on Alpe d’Huez\n1952, Stage 10, Fausto Coppi\n1976, Stage 9, Joop Zoetemelk\n1977, Stage 17, Hennie Kuiper\n1978, Stage 16, Hennie Kuiper\n1979, Stage 17, Joaquim Agostinho\n1979, Stage 18, Joop Zoetemelk\n1981, Stage 17, Peter Winnen\n1982, Stage 16, Beat Breu\n1983, Stage 17, Peter Winnen\n1984, Stage 17, Luis Herrera\n1986, Stage 18, Bernard Hinault\n1987, Stage 20, Federico Echave\n1988, Stage 12, Steven Rooks\n1989, Stage 17, Gert-Jan Theunisse\n1990, Stage 11, Gianni Bugno\n1991, Stage 17, Gianni Bugno\n1992, Stage 14, Andrew Hampsten\n1994, Stage 16, Roberto Conti\n1995, Stage 10, Marco Pantani\n1997, Stage 13, Marco Pantani\n1999, Stage 10, Giuseppe Guerini\n2001, Stage 10, [Lance Armstrong]*\n2003, Stage 8, Iban Mayo\n2004, Stage 16, [Lance Armstrong]*\n2006, Stage 15, Frank Schleck\n2008, Stage 17, Carlos Sastre\n2011, Stage 19, Pierre Rolland\n2013, Stage 18, Christophe Riblon\n2015, Stage 20, Thibaut Pinot\n* result annulled due to doping conviction"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e7404845-ddfe-4e10-bd41-28539ea91b87>","<urn:uuid:5d8067db-b774-4daf-bc54-e25d63d95292>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does Sierra Vista's new sports field renovation contribute to energy savings and sustainability?","answer":"The new sports fields contribute to sustainability through multiple features: they use Eco Therm as fill material, which is 100% biodegradable and keeps turf conditions up to 20 degrees cooler for player comfort. The complex includes Musco LED lighting that provides better visibility while protecting dark skies from light pollution. The improvements reduce water usage and energy consumption, while eliminating the need for annual closures for field rehabilitation. As part of a comprehensive electrical infrastructure modernization project, the complex will help contribute to total energy savings and projected revenue generation of over $20 million for the city.","context":["The City of Sierra Vista recently unveiled new sports fields to residents, marking the beginning of a larger initiative to increase pride, engagement, and sports tourism in the scenic Southern Arizona locale. The sustainable turf and upgraded lighting are designed to help the players on the field, and the bottom line off the field. As one component of Sierra Vista’s comprehensive electrical infrastructure modernization project, the complex will contribute to a total energy savings and projected revenue generation of over $20 million for the city.\nLaura Wilson, Director, Leisure and Library Services for the City of Sierra Vista, celebrated the Domingo Paiz Soccer Fields project completion with an event for all residents to enjoy. Wilson has served the city in various capacities since 1996 and has taken an active role in the economic development of her community.\nHere are her takeaways on how the modernization project will impact the city she loves:\nWhy did the City of Sierra Vista choose to do this renovation to the sports complex?\nOur sports fields required some significant improvements due to continuous usage by our extremely active sports community. Identifying funding opportunities to make the necessary repairs was challenging. Tying these projects in with an Energy Performance Contract gave us an opportunity to deliver optimal results for our regular users while also providing extraordinary tournament options in southeastern Arizona.\nThe improvements provide 24/7 access, 365 days per year, by eliminating the need for annual closures for field rehabilitation. They also reduce staff time and materials needed for maintenance and field lining prep, while reducing water usage and energy consumption.\nBest of all, the renovated sports complex creates many opportunities for partnerships throughout our region and beyond that can bolster efforts to attract new tournaments, visitors, and dollars to Sierra Vista.\nHow does a project like this one impact the community?\nI think having well maintained and environmentally-conscious facilities helps the City foster a sense of pride in our community felt by local residents and business owners. We hope these improved facilities will help our residents enjoy an active lifestyle year-round, create new community partnerships, and bring visitors to our area who will enjoy our local restaurants, bars, hotels, and businesses, which will bolster the City’s sports tourism efforts.\nWhat new opportunities or goals are achievable with this renovation, that previously the community wouldn’t have been able to do?\nMany of our community sports teams would leave the area fairly regularly to participate in year-round league play and tournaments. Our previous field conditions left us with limited options for providing safe, tournament-conditioned play surfaces due to multiple maintenance closures, which contributed to limited availability.\nThe improved soccer facilities are pre-marked for multiple age-group play, which includes a field that meets NCAA dimensions. These fields are ready to go 365 days a year, which gives us an opportunity to welcome everything from recreational teams to international and collegiate teams to our community for trainings, games, tournaments, ID Camps, friendly matches, etc. Our climate in southeast Arizona is typically 10-15 degrees cooler than Phoenix and Tucson year-round, so it provides unique opportunities during summer months for those wishing to beat the heat.\nWe have chosen Eco Therm as our fill, which is 100% biodegradable and keeps turf conditions up to 20 degrees cooler for player comfort. Our softball and baseball fields are natural turf and well-maintained year-round.\nThe state-of-the-art Musco LED lighting in all of our sports complexes provides better player visibility, less-glare, and protects our beautiful dark skies from light pollution. Our multi-purpose fields also provide space for additional field markings on natural grass if needed. These significant improvements to our facilities allow us to meet the growing demands of the sporting community without increasing our current footprint. It is a much more efficient use of current space.\nWhat does the community think of the upgraded athletic facilities?\nSo far, I have only received positive feedback about the facilities from the users and we certainly appreciate their patience during construction. Our residents feel the improved facilities have been well worth the wait!\nThe city is set to wrap up construction on upgrades city-wide—including the police department, city hall, community wave pool, additional soccer fields, main outdoor event venue, and wastewater operations park—early this year."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:270cba53-6863-4f2d-80b7-ee0d4c19f679>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Compare the physical security measures between the initial Berlin Wall construction in 1961 and its final form by 1975 - what were the key differences?","answer":"The initial Berlin Wall in August 1961 was very basic, consisting primarily of barbed-wire fences and large square concrete blocks added two days after construction began. In contrast, by 1975 it had evolved into a sophisticated system with two parallel walls containing a 'Death Strip' in between. The final version included additional security features like wooden towers every 1,000m with searchlights, steel hedgehog anti-vehicle obstacles, log and earth lookout bunkers, and broken glass cemented on top of walls. Despite these improvements made in 1962, 1965 and 1975, some sections remained vulnerable - cars driven at high speed could still break through in places, and some walls would crumble after heavy rain due to lack of proper foundations.","context":["An Illustrated Anatomy Of The Fighters The Inside Story Of by GREEN WILLIAM & SWANBOROUGH GORDON\nBy GREEN WILLIAM & SWANBOROUGH GORDON\nRead or Download An Illustrated Anatomy Of The Fighters The Inside Story Of 100 Classics In The Evolution Of Fighter Aircraft PDF\nSimilar history books\nIt's and index of a variety of books (fiction and non fiction) that have been censored for political purposes throughout the twentieth century.

Lookout and guard posts began to appear. Steel hedgehog anti-vehicle obstacles were emplaced on streets. Wooden towers began to appear every 1,000m with searchlights sweeping barbed wire, and broken glass was cemented atop the walls. Log and earth lookout bunkers were positioned between the towers. A car driven at speed could crash through these walls in many places, and some of them crumbled after heavy rain as there were no supporting foundations.\nWest Berliners who aided East Berliners to escape were arrested by the DDR forces when caught. Young men lending identity cards to East Berliners were charged and sentenced to five years' imprisonment for 'organizing the slave trade'.

Some East Berliners approved of the Wall, as they deeply resented the professional drain that was taking place.\nGrenzbrigade Kuste) at Rostock near the Baltic Sea, sometimes incorrectly known as 'Frontier Command Coast'. The Coast Brigade was under the operational control of the Kriegsmarine (German Navy) while the Grenzkommando had administrative control and support. Brigade personnel wore navy-style uniforms. Two frontier sectors manned by only a few hundred troops operated crossing stations on the western and southern borders: Grenzabschnitt Yolks Republik Polen 'Hermann Gartmann' at Frankfurt (Oder) and Grenzabschnitt Tschechoslowakei 'Walter Breidfeld' at Pirna.","Anyone interested in finding out what life was like living with the Berlin Wall should come to Bernauer Strasse. The street was right on the dividing line between East and West and is now part of the Berlin Wall Memorial, an open-air exhibition (if that’s the right word) which includes a Memorial, Reconciliation Church, Documentation Centre and 80 metres of the Wall.\nBefore the end of World War II, the whole length of Bernauer Strasse, was the border line between the districts of Wedding and Mitte, and consequently when the city was carved up by the victors at the end of the war, the street became part of the border between East and West Berlin.\nAlthough Wedding found itself in the Western French sector and Mitte in the Eastern Soviet sector, there was no physical barrier between the two, and people were free to travel anywhere within the city. There was however, a vast difference between how people lived in their respective sectors. The Western side of the city was not only more affluent, but it also had luxury shops, restaurants and entertainment venues for people to spend their money in – and East Berliners wanted to spend what cash they had in West Berlin; and as time went on, a steady trickle of people started to leave East Berlin for a better life across the border.\nThe 1945 Potsdam Agreement had left Berlin wholly located within the German Democratic Republic (GDR) and once people were in West Berlin, they could then travel out of the city – and out of the Eastern Bloc. The trickle of people from East to West turned into a flood and by 1961 it was reckoned that more than 3 million East Germans had left the GDR via Berlin.\nTo stop this hemorrhaging of people to the West, the GDR authorities decided to build a physical barrier, a barrier which over time became more and more difficult to penetrate – and there was no better example of how the Berlin Wall divided the city than Bernauer Strasse.\nBernauer Strasse was just an ordinary residential road lined with tenement buildings on both sides of the street, but the East/West border line didn’t run down through the middle, instead, it went right up to the front doors of the houses on the southern, Soviet side, leaving the rest of the street in the French sector.\nOn August 13th 1961, work started on constructing the Berlin Wall, which effectively meant that the buildings on the Soviet side of the street became part of the same physical barrier. The doors were locked shut, but those eager to flee East Berlin started using the upstairs windows to escape. The GDR authorities responded by forcing the residents out and then bricking up the windows and doors, but not before hundreds had escaped, although inevitably, some died trying. Below is a short film clip that shows these events unfolding.\nWith fewer opportunities to escape above-ground, people began to tunnel their way under the street: The largest tunnel was 12 metres deep and 145 metres long. For 2 days and nights between October 3rd-5th 1964, fifty-seven people managed to escape under Bernauer Strasse, but on the third night their secret was discovered by GDR border guards.\nBy 1965 most of the buildings on the Soviet side of the street had been torn down, although some of them were left with just their lower façades and were incorporated into the wall.\nThe archive pictures below show one of the tunnels (tunnel 29), and what was left of some of the apartments that were used as part of the wall.\nThe barricade divided the city for 28 years, and it was while the population were having a weekend lie-in on the night of the 13th August 1961 that GDR troops began closing off streets and erecting barbed-wire fences. Two days later, large square concrete blocks were added to make the barrier more permanent.\n‘Improvements’ were made in 1962, 1965 and 1975, and ultimately became a series of obstacles between two walls with a ‘Death Strip’ in between. At Bernauer Strasse the Church of Reconciliation found itself slap bang in the middle of the Death Strip, and so in 1985, to make life easier, GDR border troops blew it up.\nThis video by Trabinator shows the church before and during the demolition.\nNevertheless, more than 5,000 people succeeded, one way or another, in making it across to the West by the time the wall came down. Approximately 3,200 were caught trying however, and given stiff jail sentences, but well over a hundred people were killed in the attempt.\nThe four-minute video below shows some of these escapes and JFK’s famous “ich bin ein Berliner” (I am a Berliner) speech in June 1963.\nYou can find out everything you need to know about the Berlin Wall at the Berlin Wall Memorial Visitor Centre on the corner of Gartenstrasse and Bernauer Strasse. To get there I took the S Bahn to Nordbahnhof which also happens to be part of the Berlin Wall memorial site and includes an exhibition about Ghost Stations.\nThe city wasn’t only divided above ground, it was also divided beneath it as well, and Nordbahnhof was one of these Ghost Stations that was manned by armed guards to prevent trains from West Berlin stopping, and East German people escaping.\nThe Visitor Centre is the rusty-looking building at the intersection close to the station, and was my first port of call – and it should be yours too – but firstly, a word of warning: The memorial site is almost a mile long, and I only covered the first section, which still took me half a day, so you need to factor this into your schedule before starting out.\nApart from providing information, the Visitor Centre also has a film about the wall and a bookshop that I came back to in fear of spending too much time here instead of the Memorial.\nThe Visitor Centre is located in what used to be the West, so you need to walk across the road to visit the Memorial site. The whole area is divided into 4 sections and was an ongoing project when I came here in 2013. As I mentioned, I only covered Section A, mainly because this section was the most important section to see at the time, and probably still is.\nSection A is sub-titled ‘The Wall and the Death strip’ which will give you some idea on what to expect. It doesn’t attempt to recreate the original border, but is left as it was when the wall fell in November 1989, but in a respectful way.\nThe gallery below shows four aspects of the wall – 1) The wall as seen from the street (western) side, 2) the wall from the Memorial side, 3) The old Inner wall and 4) some dismantled segments.\nAs you might imagine, there are plenty of information boards explaining everything, and in the centre of the strip is the Window of Remembrance showing the pictures of some of the 136 people who lost their lives trying to escape.\nTowards the top end of the strip there’s a gap in the wall in order for you to make your way back across the road to the Documentation Centre. The main reason most people come here is to climb the steps up to the viewing platform for a bird’s eye view of the Death strip and Watchtower below (see featured pic at top of page)\nBy walking back across the road to Ackerstrasse you can enter an area that will allow you to peer into – but not enter – the Death Strip from behind the Inner Wall. The watchtower incidentally was originally positioned elsewhere and re-assembled here in 2009. At one point there were five of these watchtowers along Bernauer Strasse.\nThis was where I ended my tour of the Wall Memorial, but across Ackerstrasse is Section B and the Chapel of Reconciliation where the original church used to be. I think it’s worth pointing out though that not everybody wanted this reminder left behind, and it’s understandable in a way because it’s still fresh in people’s memory; but for the rest of us, this is without doubt the best place to come and get an insight into what life must have been like having to live with the Berlin Wall."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"instructional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e74538a4-ccb9-4f2c-90ed-11b78946f091>","<urn:uuid:2df65504-c8ed-4571-8413-9642ba0c9f07>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the financial and psychological implications for soldiers who experience combat injuries, considering both historical pension systems and modern mental health treatments?","answer":"Historically, combat injuries could lead to financial support through government pensions, as seen with soldier George Dore who received a 'liberal pension' after Te Ngutu o te Manu. Injured soldiers often required paid help, as evidenced by the presence of a 'servant' in Rowan's photograph. In terms of psychological impact, modern understanding shows that combat injuries can trigger PTSD, which requires comprehensive treatment including medication and various forms of psychotherapy such as Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, Exposure Therapy, and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR). These treatments help address symptoms like recurring memories, nightmares, and anxiety that can persist long after the physical wounds have healed.","context":["Summer scholar Caitlin Lynch has taken a particular interest in a number of photos featuring soldiers badly wounded in battle.\nCaitlin speculates on why these photographs were taken, particularly after the battle of Te Ngutu o te Manu. Did these photographs generate public sympathy and encourage pensions? Or was it a statement of bravery, commitment, and sacrifice?\nPost-hospital photo shoot\nAfter the battle of Te Ngutu o te Manu, 7 September 1868, several men who had been admitted to the Whanganui hospital visited William Harding’s photography studio to pose for their portrait.\nThese cartes-de-visite depictions are curious, if not unsettling.\nIn one, Frederick Rowan, head bandaged from tip to chin, frowns out at the camera. In another, George Dore sits angled so that his ‘spectre of (an) empty sleeve’ takes centre frame .\nBelow, a group of five men, Evans, Hamilton Geary, Edward Hope, Joseph Thompson, and Samuel Whiteside, grimly pose with an assortment of artfully placed crutches and walking canes.\nThese photographs are a stark contrast to the usual portrait of the soldier, standing tall, head held high, with a decorative sword or badge of honour. The motivation of which seems rather straightforward – you’d send it home to your proud mother, give to a girl you were hoping to impress, or just as a keepsake of your heroic glory days.\nThe purpose of the photographs of injured soldiers with their wounds emphasised are not so easy to guess, and invite questions about identity and public perception in a time of war.\nIn the wake of Te Ngutu o te Manu\nThere are a disproportionate number of images in the Gordon collection of those wounded after Te Ngutu o te Manu than other battles in the wars of the 1860s.\nThis could be due to several factors: there was a larger number of colonial soldiers wounded at Te Ngutu than many of the other conflicts; the wounded were hospitalised in a town with a photography studio; Gordon only moved to the region in 1875 and may have been more inclined to collect around later battles rather than those five years prior.\nAnother possible explanation arose when I began thinking about the soldier’s relationship with public opinion.\nHysteria-inducing press coverage\nWith the support of the imperial army only recently withdrawn from New Zealand, the battle of Te Ngutu was a chance for the government to prove themselves able defend the colony.\nThe defeat of the colonial forces therefore was a political disaster, not helped by the hysteria-inducing press coverage.\nOn 1 October, Wellington Independent reported that the ‘rebels’ now ‘threaten Wanganui with destruction .’\nFor many, the colony had never been in such a precarious condition – not only had their forces been defeated, but by a side with far fewer resources and men.\nTo the mind of a 19th-century settler, clouded by perceptions of racial inferiority, and without the insight of historical information we have today, Te Ngutu was not an indicator of Tītokowaru’s military skill but of colonial troops’ failure.\nIn parliament, in newspapers, on the streets, and in the military camps, accusations of blame were thrown around. Colonel McDonnell was deeply criticised and rumours arose of soldier’s drunken and disorderly conduct .\nWhy sit for a wounded photograph?\nTo those who had been in the confusion of Te Ngutu’s crossfire, carrying out bodies of the wounded with relentless bush-savvy opponents appearing at every corner, accusations of their disorderliness would have been hard to brush off.\nThese men, many young and inexperienced, had paid a heavy price for their service.\nPerhaps this is what motivated Rowan, Dore, Hope, Whiteside, and the others to visit Harding’s studio.\nPerhaps these injury-emphasising photographs were a statement of their commitment and sacrifice to the colony.\nIt’s less easy to dismiss someone as a drunken coward when the physical remnants of their painful experience are in black-and-white in front of your eyes.\nThe financial and social consequences of being injured\nEstablishing your identity as a disabled NZ war veteran may have had financial consequences as well as a social.\nIn the same period over in America, identifying as an amputated Union veteran gave civil war soldiers better access to government-funded prosthetics and pensions . Perhaps the situation was similar in New Zealand.\nImages which connect disability to war, representing sacrificial limbs so to speak, may have generated public sympathy and advocated tax-payer funded pensions.\nThe unusual presence of a ‘servant’ in Rowan’s photograph expresses his dependence on paid help as an expense of war.\nThe connection between injury and financial aid is suggested in an article about Dore in the Nelson Evening Mail, who although has been “aged prematurely” by his experience at Te Ngutu o te Manu, is “enjoying a liberal pension bestowed on him by the government” for his services .\nWe can never know for sure…\nIt’s not known what happened to these images, and if they were ever displayed for the public eye.\nWe can’t know for sure why these men were photographed with their injuries, but making some guesses opens up a conversation about the effect of the New Zealand wars beyond the battlefield, on photography, on politics, and on people.\n Miller, Brian Craig.

When does this happen in your life? What does it feel like? What are some causes? When does it show up? How does it affect us? What are the results of this? Lets YAC about it!\nDefined by the Mayo Clinic:\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a mental health condition that's triggered by a terrifying event — either experiencing it or witnessing it. Symptoms may include flashbacks, nightmares and severe anxiety, as well as uncontrollable thoughts about the event.\nSo.. What Does This Mean?\nGreat question. PTSD comes in all different shapes and sizes and can affect people from all walks of life at all ages. Yes, even children can experience PTSD and often they exhibit different symptoms so it's important to read on and recognize what those are. PTSD is your brain's long-term response to an event or situation that was distressing, disturbing, life-changing or catastrophic. It doesn't always pertain to soldiers or people involved in a war, nor does it always have to do with physical or sexual violence. Trauma can happen to anyone, but what makes PTSD different is that after at least a month or maybe even longer, normal trauma symptoms would subside whereas someone with PTSD continues to experience symptoms that impact their daily lives.\nWhat Causes Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder?\nWhat makes this mental illness a little different than many others is that it's generally caused by an event, whether you personally experience it, witness it or were involved in some other capacity. However, there are other environmental and inherited factors such as having a family history of anxiety and depression, the way your body responds to stress, and your general temperament that can impact whether you experience or are diagnosed with PTSD.\nWhat Are The Symptoms of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder?\nSymptoms for PTSD are broken down into four main categories and in order to be diagnosed with this disorder, according to the DSM-5, you must experience a specific amount of each for at least one month; one intrusive symptom, one avoidance symptom, two arousal symptoms, and two changes in mood and thinking. There are other physical symptoms that have been recorded however they don't pertain to the diagnoses in the DSM-5.\n- reliving the event through flashbacks\n- distressing dreams or nightmares about the event\n- recurring memories that won't leave your mind no matter how hard you try\n- avoiding people, places, activities, objects, and situations that bring on distressing memories\n- avoid remembering or thinking about the traumatic event\n- resist talking about what happened or how they feel about it\nChanges in Emotional Reaction (also called Arousal Symptoms)\n- easily startled or frightened, having a guard up, feeling jumpy\n- self-destructive behavior\n- troubles sleeping or concentrating\n- angry outbursts or aggressive behavior\n- negative reactions when talking about a traumatic event\n- feeling guilty or shameful\nChanges in Mood + Thinking\n- negative thoughts about yourself, other people or the world\n- hopelessness especially about the future\n- lack of memory, especially in relation to the traumatic event\n- hard time maintaining relationships\n- detached from family or friends or activities you used to enjoy\n- feeling dissociated or emotional numb\n- sweating, shaking, headaches, dizziness, stomach problems, aches and pains, and chest pain\n- weakened immune system meaning more susceptible to infection\n- tiredness and fatigue\nSymptoms for Children\n- extreme separation anxiety - usually from parents.\n- reenactment of traumatic events\n- phobias unrelated to the event i.e. being scared of monsters\n- regression in skills such as potty training\n- problems sleeping or nightmares, not necessarily related to the event\n- irritability and aggression\n- aches and pains\nHow Is It Treated?\nA combination of medication and psychotherapy or talk therapy is proven to be most beneficial when dealing with PTSD. Let's start with the different types of therapy; Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) can help to retrain your brain by recognizing the ways and patterns in which your brain is negatively thinking about the incident and how it's affecting you. Exposure Therapy, which is pretty much exactly how it sounds, by facing painful situations or memories to learn how to cope or understand how they're affecting you. Another kind of therapy is getting a lot of attention lately and that's Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), it combines exposure therapy with guided eye movements to help you process and change how you react to traumatic memories. Since other mental illnesses can tag along with PTSD like anxiety and depression, often medication is offered along with talk therapy to mitigate some of those symptoms. Anti Depression and Anti Anxiety medication may be recommended or discussed with your doctor. There are also many other natural and herbal treatments that are proven to be helpful for coping with PTSD, we always advise talking to a doctor before introducing any sort of treatment.\nLet's YAC About It!\nIt's time to break down the barriers and end the stigma surrounding mental health. If you live with mental illness or just want to chat, our comments and inboxes are always open. We strongly believe in the value of sharing our experiences + stories in hopes even one person knows they're not alone. This blog is an introduction to a two-part series, the second part will introduce all sorts of resources and ways to find the help you need.

It occurs mainly in Africa and Southeast Asia and is transmitted by mosquitoes. In addition to high fever, severe muscle and joint pain are typical Chikungunya symptoms. The disease is usually benign. However, only the complaints can be treated, not the triggering virus. Read all important information about Chikungunya here.\nICD codes for this disease: ICD codes are internationally valid medical diagnosis codes. They are found e.g. in doctor's letters or on incapacity certificates. A92\nCauses and risk factors\nExaminations and diagnosis\nDisease course and prognosis\nChikungunya is a feverish infectious disease. It is triggered by the Chikungunya virus. This pathogen, also known as CHIK virus, is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes. The name comes from Tanzania. In the language of the Makonde, Chikungunya means \"warping\" or \"becoming crooked,\" indicating the typical Chikungunya symptoms of joint and muscle pain.\nChikungunya occurs in many Asian and African countries, including the tropical regions of the Indian subcontinent and the Pacific Islands. In 2013, Chikungunya met Caribbean islands and spread for the first time in the region of North, Central and South America. Previously, there had been only isolated cases with returnees.\nIn Europe so far only transfers from Italy (2007 scarcely 200 sick ones by a from south India returned tourists) and France were proven. Chikungunya is one of the \"travel diseases\" due to its distribution.\nIn 2014, the Chikungunya fever was observed in 162 vacationers, according to the Robert Koch Institute. The year before, it was only 16. As a reason for the increase, the spread of Chikungunya virus in the American countries is suspected. The number of Asian tiger mosquitoes - as a typical transmitter of the CHIK virus - is also increasing in Germany. But it has not yet come to disease transmissions.\nThe first symptoms of Chikungunya disease appear after about two to seven, sometimes even after twelve days (incubation period). Infected people suddenly get high fever (average 39 degrees Celsius) and headaches. In some cases, the increased body temperature drops abruptly after a few days, but then increases rapidly (about one to three days, sometimes only a week later). Physicians speak in this case of a biphasic fever course. Due to the rapid rise in temperature, infants and toddlers may experience febrile convulsions.\nTypical Chikungunya symptoms are also severe joint and muscle pain (arthralgia and myalgia) that occur from the beginning. These are sometimes so unbearable that those affected can hardly stand. In some cases, patients also complain of swollen joints and lymph nodes. Conjunctivitis, cervical and abdominal pain are among the rare but possible Chikungunya symptoms. The heavily perfused, hot skin (flush) can sometimes be followed by an itchy, nodular-mottled rash (maculopapular rash). Chikungunya's severe malady accompanied by fatigue and nausea will fade after about one to two weeks.\nThe Chikungunya symptoms are sometimes very strong. However, not all infected people develop signs of the disease. In some cases, Chikungunya is also symptomless. In about one quarter of those affected it comes to more severe disease processes with punctate skin bleeding (petechiae) and mucosal bleeding (eg nosebleeds). In this case, doctors speak of a hemorrhagic Chikungunya fever, which is why Chikungunya is also counted among the haemorrhagic fever diseases.\nChikungunya: causes and risk factors\nTwo points play a crucial role in the causes of Chikungunya disease. First, the Chikungunya virus itself as a pathogen, on the other hand its transmission to humans.\nThe CHIK virus belongs to the family of the so-called Togaviridae and the large genus of alphaviruses. Chikungunya is an RNA virus and was first described in 1952/53 during an outbreak in Tanzania. It's similar to the O'nyong-nyong virus. Other typical togaviruses are, for example, the Ross River virus, the Eastern and Western Encephalitis virus or the rubella virus. The viruses spread through the lymph nodes and blood. However, how exactly the virus affects the human cells is still under investigation. Ingested there, the pathogen uses the cellular components to multiply. The Chikungunya virus is divided into three variants due to the smallest structural differences, one West African, one East Central South African and one Asian.It should therefore be able to adapt to new geographical circumstances.\nTransmission of the Chikungunya virus\nThe CHIK virus is transmitted almost exclusively by mosquitoes from person to person. Classic representatives are mosquitoes of the genus Aedes aegypti, Aedes albopictus, Aedes africanus, Aedes furcifer and Mansoniaspezies. But also mosquitoes of the Culex genus are possible transmitters. The virus spreads and multiplies after the sting in the human body. Repeated stings, the mosquito takes the Chikungunya virus again and transmits it to other people.\nThis cycle has also been observed in meerkats, baboons and rodents (jungle cycle). However, the animals are only intermediate carriers of the virus, which is also transmitted by mosquito bites ultimately from the animals to humans (bridge transfer). Special attention should be paid to the mosquito species Aedes albopictus. Known as the Asian tiger mosquito, it is currently spreading around the world and is responsible, among other things, for the transmissions in Italy. Also in Germany in 2007 their eggs, in 2011 finally living specimens were discovered.\nThis small (5mm), black-silver-white striped mosquito is very active. In addition, it transmits not only the Chikungunya, but also the West Nile, Yellow Fever and Dengue virus. Chikungunya was therefore observed simultaneously with dengue fever, especially in India and Southeast Asia. Other mosquito species can cause several diseases - for example Aedes aegypti yellow fever.\nPeople with high blood pressure, blood sugar disease or heart failure, older people over 65 years, and newborns have an increased risk that the Chikungunya virus causes a serious illness. Pregnancy is an equally dangerous risk factor because mothers can transmit the virus to their child.\nChikungunya: diagnosis and examination\nIf you suspect that you have Chikungunya, you should consult your family doctor or a specialist in tropical medicine. Since clear early symptoms are missing, the history of the medical history (anamnesis) is crucial. The doctor first asks for typical symptoms (and their course). In particular, information on recent trips is important. You may be asked the following questions:\n- Since when do the complaints exist?\n- When was the last time you were abroad?\n- Where did you go? How long was your stay in the travel destination?\n- Were you stung by mosquitoes?\n- Do you have fever? Or have you recently measured elevated body temperature?\n- Have your symptoms abated in the meantime and are now increasing again (as an indication of the possible biphasic Chikungunya course)?\n- Do you have (unbearable) joint pain or swelling?\nAfter the medical history, your doctor will examine you physically. Among other things, he can measure your body temperature and scan your lymph nodes. He will pay particular attention to the joints and assess any possible swelling or reddening of the skin.\nThere are several laboratory procedures to ensure the diagnosis Chikungunya. The doctor takes several blood samples. Nonspecific blood levels may be altered and generally indicate a physical illness. These include, for example, a reduction in white (lymphopenia) and red blood cells (anemia) and platelets (thrombocytopenia). In severe cases, for example, liver enzymes may also be elevated.\nFor safe detection, Chikungunya virus can either be isolated directly or its genetic material can be detected. In addition, infected blood is tested for specific antibodies against Chikungunya. The virus itself can be bred within the first three days in certain cultures. Specific proteins of the human immune system, so-called immunoglobulin (Ig) M antibodies, usually appear five to seven days after onset of disease and remain detectable for up to half a year. IgG antibodies can be determined approximately from the second week and months later. Through the so-called polymerase chain reaction (PCR) parts of the virus genome (viral RNA) can be duplicated and confirm the Chikungunya fever.\nDengue fever and other diseases\nIn the investigation on Chikungunya the doctor will exclude other diseases, especially other tropical diseases. These include leptospirosis, malaria, diseases caused by other alphaviruses (for example, O'nyong-nyong, Ross river), rubella, enterovirus and parvovirus infections, as well as rheumatic diseases such as post-infectious arthritis. Due to similar symptoms, but a more severe disease, dengue fever should be considered. The following table compares chikungunya with dengue fever:\nduration of fever\nusually only a few days\nBleeding (hemorrhagic fever)\nalmost always and long lasting (sometimes months)\nrare and if, of significantly shorter duration\nIn addition, the laboratory values usually differ. While the white blood cells are usually reduced in Chikungunya, their number rarely changes in dengue. The reverse is true for the platelets. They are especially humiliated with dengue fever. If, during or after traveling, especially in high-risk areas, you have a medical condition, such as fever, headache, body aches, nausea and vomiting.\nThere is no treatment that directly combats and eliminates the Chikungunya virus. Therefore, only the symptoms of the disease can be treated and alleviated. It is crucial bed rest and adequate hydration, as the body loses much water, especially during the fever. Painkillers (analgesics) and fever (antipyretics) soften typical Chikungunya symptoms. For this purpose, especially non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (anti-inflammatory drugs, NSAIDs) are suitable.\nIn case of persistent joint pain in addition to painkillers (locally applied) corticosteroids and physiotherapy can have a beneficial effect. In Dengue fever risk areas, acetaminophen (acetaminophen) is usually used to reduce the risk of bleeding. Acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), which disturbs the function of platelets, should therefore be avoided. In severe Chikungunya fever course, intensive care monitoring may be necessary. Even with other symptoms such as conjunctivitis, the treatment is expanded accordingly.\nA vaccine with inactivated chikungunya virus particles is currently being tested. A medical provision is not yet possible.\nChikungunya: disease course and prognosis\nThe Chikungunya virus can be different. In some cases, it does not trigger any symptoms. If it comes to Chikungunya fever, this usually heals without consequences within a few weeks. However, the joint complaints can sometimes last for months and occur at different joints. Especially in infants, the virus can also affect the liver or the nervous system. Although these severe illnesses are very rare, they represent a life-threatening situation. On average, about 4 out of 100 people die from chikungunya. In infants, the risk of dying from Chikungunya is slightly higher.\nThe Chikungunya virus can neither be treated nor vaccinated. Therefore, some measures should be followed to protect against mosquito bites that carry the virus. You should also avoid mosquitoes in the event of illness in the first week, as with renewed stitches, the virus is resumed and transmitted to your fellow human beings.\nUse insect repellent!\nParticularly effective are these so-called repellents with the active ingredients DEET, picaridine, IR3535 or plant-based lemon eucalyptus oil or products based on it, namely PMD / citriodiol.\nWear long pants and long-sleeved clothes!\nFor additional protection you can spray your clothes with permethrin.\nWatch out for mosquito nets, especially over the bed and windows!\nThis is especially true during sleep during the day, as the Chikungunya mosquitoes sting particularly aggressive at this time.\nAvoid and eliminate water points in your environment!\nHere mosquitoes multiply, which transmit Chikungunya. Empty buckets and buckets regularly or cover places where new mosquitoes can ripen. Avoid living in close proximity to ponds or similar waterholes. It may be necessary to use insecticides.\nDo not travel to risk areas if you have limited health or are pregnant!\nFor more information about high risk areas, visit the World Health Organization, the Federal Department of Foreign Affairs website and the European or American health authorities (ECDC, CDC).\nIn general, you should consult a doctor immediately if you have any general symptoms of illness (fever, nausea, vomiting, headache and body aches), especially during or after traveling to high-risk areas. Do not be afraid to visit the clinics of your travel destination if necessary (experienced by the regionally frequent occurrence of Chikungunya). In this way, a serious illness can be prevented in good time and a spread of Chikungunya be contained."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f4c3078e-3ccf-432b-8a77-71703c17a015>","<urn:uuid:b186da89-9834-492a-bf59-6c9b68eaab83>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do environmental factors affect iron absorption in both humans and piglets raised in different settings?","answer":"In piglets, the environment directly affects iron absorption - those raised outside naturally obtain iron from soil or mud, while those on concrete floors need iron supplements to prevent deficiency. In humans, environmental factors like diet composition affect iron absorption - vitamin C-rich fruits increase absorption, while certain foods like legumes, beans, cereals, and coffee hinder it. Additionally, medications like proton pump inhibitors can interfere with iron absorption in humans.","context":["‘Farrow’ originally meant ‘young pig’. In the early 1400s it came to refer to the birth process in pigs. The sow’s litter is also called a ‘farrow’.\nThe most critical period in the life of a pig is from birth to weaning. On average, about two pigs per litter are lost during this time. Good management will reduce these losses, and it starts with the sow.\nThe average gestation period is 114 days (three months, three weeks and three days). In the weeks before farrowing, move the sow to the farrowing pen once a week for a short period, so that she gets used to it; this will reduce stress. Four to five days before farrowing, wash and disinfect her, then place her in the farrowing pen.\nCheck the udder for hard spots or lumps. The latter can be treated with an antibiotic.\nConstipation often occurs at this stage, but can be prevented by feeding the sow green feed, such as lucerne, or high-fibre feed (bran or pollard).\nPreparing the pen\n- The farrowing pen should be erected some distance from the other pens, and strict hygiene maintained at all times.\n- After the previous sow and her litter have been removed, clean the pen using a high-pressure spray, scrubbing brush, and good disinfectant, such as a 4% formalin solution. Leave the pen unoccupied for two to three days.\n- Remove soiled and wet bedding daily and replace it with dry bedding.\nIt’s crucial to supervise farrowing. Newborn piglets have three basic requirements: a suitable environment; adequate and regular nutrition; and absence of disease and crushing.\nWatch out for constipation in the sow and make sure she has discharged her afterbirth.\nCheck her temperature for fever to make sure she is not suffering from infection.\nIf she has insufficient milk, her litter may die of hunger. Agalactia (giving too little milk) and mastitis require immediate veterinary treatment.\n- Cut the umbilical cord a few days after the piglets’ birth using a disinfected pair of scissors. Leave a 2cm section.\n- Disinfect the sow’s navel with an iodine solution to prevent bacterial infection.\n- Piglets are born with low iron reserves and receive only a limited supply from the sow’s milk. If they are reared outside, they absorb iron from the soil or mud, which will provide their iron needs. If they are reared on a concrete floor, they can suffer from iron deficiency; this can cause anaemia, which results in poor appetite and slow growth. Administer iron supplements three to seven days after birth via an injection in the neck.\n- Piglets have sharp teeth. To prevent them from injuring each other or the sow’s teats, clip their teeth with a tusk clipper. Take care while doing so to avoid hurting the gums. Leave about half of the tooth in place.\n- Docking a piglet’s tail will reduce tail biting and infection when the animal is older. Leave an 80mm stub. Tails and teeth should be clipped before the piglets reach three days of age. Finally, earmark each piglet for identification purposes.\nSource: Majane, P. 2005. ‘Care of sow and piglets’.

Do you find it difficult to climb the stairs without a gasp, even though you are physically fit? If yes, chances are you may be low on iron- especially if you are a pregnant woman.\nAlthough you might not think of iron as an essential nutrient, you will be shocked to know that figures from the CDC show, more than 10 million Americans are deficient in iron, and 5 million of those develop iron deficiency anemia.\nLet us delve into why iron is so essential for your health, how much iron you need to take daily, its food sources, causes and symptoms of iron deficiency, and when you need to take iron supplements.\nHealth Benefits of Iron\nYou may know iron to be essential for the synthesis of hemoglobin- a protein that carries and transfers oxygen from lungs to other body parts. But it has a lot more to do with your health. It gives you energy, improves your muscle stamina, keeps your focus and concentration, boosts your immunity, detoxifies your body, and makes you sleep well and enough.\n● Hemoglobin-Oxygen Delivery: Iron is a crucial mineral required to synthesize hemoglobin- the major protein in your red blood cells, which helps carry and transfer oxygen from lungs to every cell of your body. The cells in your body need oxygen for their metabolism (energy production, waste degradation, etc.). Without enough iron, your body fails to make enough numbers of red blood cells, leading to iron deficiency anemia. You get easily fatigued, shortness of breath, pale skin, headaches, and lightheadedness.\n● Energy Production: Some enzymes that catalyze oxidative phosphorylation (the process of generating ATP- the ultimate energy source for cells, from the foods you eat) require iron as a cofactor for their optimum functioning. Without enough iron, you may not be able to convert food into energy and feel fatigued and lethargic.\n● Brain Health: Iron is also beneficial for your brain health. It is essential for the cognitive functioning of our brains. It increases your attention span and concentration. It helps convey your brain’s signals to muscles and helps them move. It also helps synthesize neurotransmitters- chemicals that transfer information from your brain to other body parts.\n● Body Detoxification: Iron acts as a cofactor for enzymes that neutralize the harmful radicals and toxins from your brain and body as well as other potential toxins entering the body from the outside environment.\n● Immune Health: Iron is essential for both your innate and adaptive immunity. It activates your immune cells to fight against foreign invaders and pathogens. It also helps in the synthesis of different chemicals that boost immunity. Moreover, iron can also directly damage bacteria and pathogens. All these effects of iron boost your immunity and keep your disease-free.\n● Temperature Regulation: Iron is also essential for your body’s temperature regulation. It helps heat production and prevents heat loss from the body. Iron deficiency has been associated with disturbed thermoregulation. It may be due to bad thyroid functioning due to iron deficiency.\n● Sleep Quality: Iron also promotes your sleep quality. A 2015 study showed an association between iron deficiency and sleep difficulties like restless sleep, insomnia (inability to sleep), and sleep apnea. Iron supplementation in iron-deficient individuals significantly improves their sleep length and quality.\n● Healthy Pregnancy: Iron also promotes a healthy pregnancy. Adequate iron levels help make new red blood cells to deliver oxygen and other nutrients to the developing baby. Moreover, iron is also crucial for the early brain development of the embryo. Iron deficiency can lead to serious health problems in the baby as well as the mother.\nHow Much Iron Do You Need Daily\nYour daily requirements for iron may vary depending upon your age, sex, and diet.\nBoth males and females need a little more than usual amounts of iron during their puberty. Females during their reproductive age need more iron than males due to massive iron loss in menstrual bleeding. Pregnant and lactating mothers need an additional amount of iron to meet their baby’s iron demands.\nHere is a detailed description of the recommended daily allowance of iron, depending on the age of a person.\n● Newborns up to six months old: 0.27 milligrams per day.\n● Seven months to one-year-old: 11 milligrams per day.\n● 1-3 years old: 7 milligrams per day. ● 4-8 years old: 10 milligrams per day.\n● 9-13 years old: 8 milligrams per day. ● 14-18 years old: 11 milligrams per day. ● Older than 19: 8 milligrams per day.\n● 9-13 years old: 8 milligrams per day. ● 14-18 years old: 15 milligrams per day. ● 19-50 years old: 18 milligrams per day. ● Older than 51 years: 8 milligrams per day. ● Pregnant women: 27 milligrams per day ● lactating women: 10 milligrams per day.\nIron is found in a variety of both animal and plant foods. Animal foods provide you with heme-iron while plant foods offer non-heme-iron. Heme-iron is better absorbed from the gut.\nNon-heme-iron absorption from the gut is also affected by other foods you eat along with iron foods. Fruits high in vitamin C, like lemons and oranges, significantly increase the absorption of iron from intestines.\nSimilarly, there are certain foods and medicines which hinder the absorption of iron from the intestines. Foods include legumes, beans, cereals, and coffee, and medicines include proton pump inhibitors (used to treat stomach ulcers), tannins, and phosphates in carbonated water.\nIron is a low bioavailability nutrient. It means that your gut can absorb and utilize only a small portion of the iron you eat. Your intestine absorbs around 40% of heme-iron from animal foods you eat. For non-heme-iron from plant foods, you can absorb only 2% – 20% of the foods you eat.\nTherefore, the recommended daily allowance (RDA) of iron for vegetarians is 1.8 times more as compared to non-vegetarians who take most of their iron requirements from animal meat.\nHere are some excellent food sources of heme and non-heme iron.\n● 3.5 ounce (100 grams) of Beef Liver provides 4.2 milligrams (mg) of heme-iron. Pregnant women should not eat beef liver as it contains high amounts of retinoic acid. ● 3.5 oz (100 grams) of Turkey Meat may provide up to 1.5 mg or heme-iron. ● 3.5 oz (100 grams) of Canned Clams provide 3 mg of heme-iron. ● 3.5 oz (100 grams) of Canned Tuna Fish delivers 1.6 mg of heme-iron. ● 3.5 oz (100 gm) of Red Beef provides 2.7 mg of heme-iron.\n● 3.5 oz (100 grams) of cooked Spinach may provide 2.5 milligrams of iron. ● 3.5 oz (100 gm) of boiled Chickpeas offer 6.4 mg of iron. ● 1 cup of stewed Tomatoes provides 3.5 mg of iron. ● 1 cup of Tofu provides 5 mg of iron. ● 3.5 oz (100 gm) baked Potatoes provide 1.87 mg of iron. ● 1 cup (150 gm) serving of Broccoli provides 1 mg of iron.\nWhat Is Iron Deficiency Anemia\nAnemia is a health condition in which your body fails to synthesize enough numbers of red blood cells to carry and deliver oxygen from the lungs to other body parts. There are many causes of anemia, but iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia.\nAs described above, you need iron to synthesize hemoglobin- the main oxygen-carrying protein in red blood cells. Less iron leads to less hemoglobin synthesis, ultimately leading to decreased synthesis of red blood cells.\nCauses Of Iron Deficiency\nIron deficiency appears either when you don’t get enough iron from your diet, don’t absorb iron through your gut, or you lose a lot of iron due to blood loss of any cause.\nHere are some common causes of iron deficiency leading to anemia:\n● Insufficient Iron Intake. Not eating iron-rich foods (e.g., vegans) over an extended period may lead to iron deficiency. As iron is essential during the growth and development period, children and pregnant women should prefer eating even more iron-rich foods. ● Defective Iron Absorption from Gut. Despite including adequate iron-rich foods in your diet, you may still go iron deficient if your gut doesn’t absorb the iron from the foods you eat. Certain intestine disorders or surgeries can affect the iron absorption from your stomach. ● Heavy Blood Loss. Blood loss, due to any reason, also accompanies the loss of iron from the body. Internal bleeding due to ulcers in the stomach or intestine or external bleeding due to any injury, heavy menstruation, or during childbirth may also lead to iron deficiency. Heavy bleeding due to endometriosis may also cause iron deficiency in women. ● Pregnancy. Pregnant women need extra blood cells to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the developing baby. They need excess iron to synthesize new red blood cells. If not met through diet, this requirement may lead to iron deficiency in pregnant women.\nSymptoms of Iron Deficiency Anemia\nAt first, the symptoms of iron deficiency anemia may remain mild, and you may not even get a hint about them. The data from the American Society of Hematology shows that most people just don’t know that they have symptoms of mild anemia until they get a regular blood test.\nThe main symptoms of moderate to severe iron deficiency anemia include:\n● Pale Yellow Skin ● Paleness in the white of the eye ● Unusual weakness and fatigue ● Dizziness ● Shortness of breath ● Headaches ● Light-headedness ● Cold extremities ● Tingling sensation in the legs ● Tongue soreness ● Brittle nails, and ● An irregular, fast heartbeat.\nTreatment of Iron Deficiency Anemia\nThe treatment options for iron deficiency anemia aim to replenish the iron levels in the body. You may increase the iron-rich foods in your diet (but it is a time taking option) or may take iron supplements to meet ion demands on an urgent basis. For better absorption, you should take iron tablets on an empty stomach. You may need to take iron supplements for about six months. Iron supplements may also cause constipation.\nTreating the cause of heavy bleeding and preventing blood loss may also be a good treatment option for iron deficiency anemia if due to blood loss.\nIron is a nutrient essential for your health. Its primary role is in the synthesis of hemoglobin. It also benefits your brain health, immune system, and sleep quality. Not eating enough iron-rich foods over a long time may lead to iron deficiency anemia. Pale skin, fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and headaches are symptoms of iron deficiency anemia. You should consult your doctor if you have these symptoms. Iron supplements are commonly used to treat iron-deficiency anemia."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c0177be9-009d-4f5c-8aca-4c999213d094>","<urn:uuid:f2130f9a-3b42-45a9-9037-ce9f32890ca8>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the primary applications of VR in sports training, and how should organizations estimate the associated training and change management costs?","answer":"VR in sports training, particularly using systems like HTC Vive, enables immersive simulations for multiple sports including Football, Rugby, Cricket, Ice Hockey, and Baseball. It allows coaches to create minimal impact virtual training environments where they can assess players' cognitive capabilities, skill levels, and performance under pressure. The system includes specific drills like Rondo Scan and Color Combo to evaluate composure, anticipation, and decision-making. As for estimating training and change management costs, organizations need to consider multiple factors including: dedicated change management team expenses, training materials development, instructor costs, training facilities, technology infrastructure, employee time spent in training, and evaluation tools. They should also budget for organizational adjustments such as process redesign, workflow integration, and post-implementation support, while maintaining a contingency budget for unforeseen costs.","context":["Technology in Sport: How is VR (Virtual Reality) impacting elite sport? I spent an evening with the lovely folks at HTC Vive alongside some sport and technology experts to see what they’re up to. HTC Vive is a first of its kind virtual reality system, and the headset of choice for elite sports teams who are looking to use advanced analytics to bring about marginal gains.\nThe Vive Pro headset offers the highest quality and most accurate experience available, which is why the system is being used by market leading VR training and cognitive development tools such as\nVive technology is being used by a range of companies around the world to develop applications for teams across a wide number of sports including Football, Rugby and Cricket, Ice Hockey, Baseball and many others, providing elite players with the ability to immerse themselves visually, physically and emotionally in a virtual world, allowing for true-to-life interactions and experiences.\nBy developing highly immersive simulations of real-world sporting environments, minimal impact virtual training can be created to benefit both players and coaches. Using VR in sport means coaches can re-enact a series of unique drills mapped to simulate the pressure and changing realities of a game, offering an accurate assessment of the cognitive capabilities, skill levels, strengths and weakness of every player in a squad.\nThis type of training allows coaches to use specifically designed applications which link the brain and body in an effort to achieve measurable improvements in skills, game awareness and confidence. These assessments can inform structured, tailor-made programmes for the development of player’s physical skills, mental sharpness and ability to stay composed in high-pressure situations. Due to the minimal impact virtual training environment, this means injured players are also able to practice skills and regain sharpness in a safe way, before fully committing to full exertion efforts on the real-world training pitch.\nThe likes of Rezzil and INCISIV have used HTC Vive because of the precision required in accurately recreating professional sporting scenarios, helping professional coaches to maximise the potential of players on the pitch. Through a series of unique drills mapped to simulate the pressure and changing realities of the game on the pitch, these partners are able to provide accurate assessments of the cognitive capabilities, skill levels, strengths and weakness of every player in a squad.\nThe use of Vive Tracker technology also enables teams to bring real-life apparatus such as racquets, boots and baseball bats into the virtual reality experience, resulting in a greater level of accuracy and immersion which is needed at the highest/elite level. The Vive Wireless Adapter, compatible with the\nAs such Vive is used in the following sports:\n• Cricket – Working with partners such as INCISIV, the Virtual Reality batting system to enable boards such as the ECB and Cricket Ireland to measure a player’s ability to make great decisions and act intelligently, but also offers new ways to train smarter, protect players from injury and facilitate return-to-play.\nTo do this INCISIV is developing a unique VR based platform that combined in-game VR with their scientifically validated behavioural analytics that unlocks the secrets of how players make winning decisions under\n• Rugby – INCISIV\n• Football – HTC Vive is used by partners such as\nMore than 150 elite players and hundreds of academy players have gone through the system with Manchester United Academy, and 4 of the top 6 Premier League teams benefiting from this technology in their training. Meanwhile, INCISIV is also using the same technology to translate 20\n• Ice Hockey –Sense Arena has created a Virtual Reality hockey training platform, with more than 50 drills and a dozen pre-set training plans that focus on the development of hockey intelligence, decision making, multitasking, time movement anticipation and speed of reaction in hockey. They do this by training the brain muscle to develop players both physically and mentally\n• Baseball – DiamondFX is next-generation player development and scouting system that combines real MLB data, virtual reality and machine learning to help teams and players make better decisions. They use the HTC Vive headset as their VR provider of choice.\nI got to try out the Rugby and Football experience to see how well it tracks my movement, latency and the type of results/reports generated by the system. To do this, I tried the five key baseline REZZIL drills:\n• Rondo Scan: A comprehensive scan providing data about a player’s composure, body form, anticipation, and decision-making process while passing and receiving the ball. This drill helps a player improve on-the-ball composure, enhancing their anticipation and situational awareness.\n• Color Combo: This drill analyses and improves a player’s anticipation, agility, forward planning, body positioning, and their ability to handle pressure while dealing with high-stress situations on the field.\n• Pressure Pass: This drill measures a player’s composure under pressure. It also analyses vision, the timing of passes, agile thinking, planning, and anticipation. Practising this drill helps players to better manage high-pressure moments on the pitch and recognise when they should release—or hold—the ball.\n• Shoulder Sums: Tracking vision, situational awareness, composure, and performance under pressure, this drill is designed to help players keep possession of the ball by making them more conscious of their surroundings. It also improves their ability to receive and pass under pressure.\n• Head Smart: By tracking a player’s vision, timing, and ability to keep track of the ball, this drill teaches players how to properly time a headed pass and locate open teammates.\nOverall, it’s fascinating to see how far VR has come and how invested businesses like REZZIL and INCISIV are in using VR to bring sports training and reporting to life. With a tool like the Vive, there’s no doubt it will only get better and better. At the moment trackers are used separately on the body, for example, in the Football experience, trackers are worn on shin pads, the boot as well as the headset itself with eye-tracking. Eye-tracking is not even being harnessed yet and a future where a full suit can be worn would be amazing.

For most\nsewage sludge, the new regulation replaces part 257.\nChapter 2 Sewage Sludge Pathogens\nAs mentioned in Chapter 1, one concern is the potential effect of some human pathogens on animals. Enteric viruses\ncan cross species lines, and animal life, particularly warm blooded animals, can be affected if they are exposed to some\nof the pathogens found in sewage sludge.\n[Documents show neither] Domestic animals [or humans] are protected by site restrictions which limit grazing on\nsludge amended land [or harvesting food crops, especially since grass can not be harvested for 1 year]\nHow could [human] exposure to these pathogens occur?\n- If improperly treated sewage sludge was illegally applied to land or placed on a surface disposal site, humans and\nanimals could be exposed to pathogens directly by coming into contact with the sewage sludge, or indirectly by\nconsuming drinking water or food contaminated by sewage sludge pathogens. Insects, birds, rodents, and even\nfarm workers could contribute to these exposure routes by transporting sewage sludge and sewage sludge\npathogens away from the site. Potential routes of exposure include:\n- . Touching the sewage sludge.\n- . Walking through an area - such as a field, forest, or reclamation area - shortly after sewage sludge application.\n- . Handling soil from fields where sewage sludge has been applied.\n- Inhaling microbes that become airborne (via aerosols, dust, etc.) during sewage sludge spreading or by strong\nwinds, plowing, or cultivating the soil after application.\n- Consumption of pathogen-contaminated crops grown on sewage sludge-amended soil or of other food products\nthat have been contaminated by contact with these crops or field workers, etc.\n- Consumption of pathogen-contaminated milk or other food products from animals contaminated by grazing in\npastures or fed crops grown on sewage sludge-amended fields.\n- Ingestion of drinking water or recreational waters contaminated by runoff from nearby land application sites or by\norganisms from sewage sludge migrating into ground-water aquifers.\n- Consumption of inadequately cooked or uncooked pathogen-contaminated fish from water contaminated by\nrunoff from a nearby sewage sludge application site.\n- Contact with sewage sludge or pathogens transported away from the land application or surface disposal site by\nrodents, insects, or other vectors, including grazing animals or pets.\n- Handling soil from fields where sewage sludge has been applied\n- Handling soil or food from home gardens where sewage sludge has been applied\n- Inhaling dust**\n- Walking through fields where sewage sludge has been applied*\n- Consumption of crops from fields on which sewage sludge has been applied\n- Consumption of milk or animal products from animals grazed on fields where sewage sludge has been\n- Ingestion of water contaminated by runoff from fields where sewage sludge has been applied\n- Ingestion of inadequately cooked fish from water contaminated by runoff from fields where sewage sludge has\n- Contact with vectors which have been in contact with sewage sludge [flies, dogs, cats, cattle, horses, etc.]\n- workers exposed to Class B biosolids might benefit from several additional precautions. For example, dust masks\nshould be worn for the spreading of dry materials, and workers should wash their hands carefully after working\nwith sewage sludge or biosolids.\nOther recommended practices for workers handling biosolids or sewage sludge include:\n- Wash hands before eating, drinking, smoking or using the restroom.\n- Use gloves when touching biosolids or sewage sludge or surfaces exposed to biosolids or sewage sludge.\n- Remove excess sewage sludge or biosolids from shoes prior to entering an enclosed vehicle.\n- Keep wounds covered with clean, dry bandages.\n- If contact with biosolids or sewage sludge occurs, wash contact area thoroughly with soap and water.\nWhat is a bioaerosol?\n- Bioaerosols are airborne water droplets containing microorganisms. These may include pathogenic\nmicroorganisms. Bioaerosols are a potential public health concern with regard to Class B biosolids because if\npathogens are contained in the biosolids, they may become airborne and infect workers or the public through\ndirect inhalation or through contact after settling on clothing or tools. It has been found that aerosolization of\nprotozoa and helminths is unlikely, but bacteria or bacterial components (endotoxin) and viruses may become\nairborne and disperse from an application source depending on local meteorological and topographical conditions.\n- Pathogens may become airborne via the spray of liquid biosolids from a splash plate or high-pressure hose, or in\nfine particulate dissemination as dewatered biosolids are applied or incorporated. While high-pressure spray\napplications may result in some aerosolization of pathogens, this type of equipment is generally used on large,\nremote sites such as forests, where the impact on the public is minimal.\nWhat is Aspergillus fumigatus? A. fumigatus is not covered in the Part 503.\n- In general, it has been found that concentrations of [airborne] A. fumigatus drop to background\nlevels within 500-1000 feet of site activity.\n- Aspergillus fumigatus is a pathogenic fungus which is found in decaying organic matter such as\nsewage sludge, leaves, or wood. Because the fungus is heat resistant, and because sewage sludge\ncomposting facilities often use wood chips as a bulking agent, A, fumigatus has been associated with\ncomposting. Inhalation of A fumigatus spores may result in allergenic effects including irritation of the\nmucous membranes and asthma. However, A, fumigatus is a secondary, or opportunistic pathogen,\nand infection from A. fumigatus (\"Aspergillosis\") is limited to debilitated or immune-compromised\n§ 503.9 General definitions.\n(j) Feed crops are crops produced\nprimarily for consumption by animals.\n(k) Fiber crops are crops such as flax and\n(l) Food crops are crops consumed by\nhumans.

St. Patrick's Church saw numerous modifications over time, including replacement of facing stone in 1911, addition of a bell tower in 1912, installation of an organ in 1931, and various modernizations to accommodate changes in Roman Catholic worship services following Vatican II. The Fifth Reformed Dutch Church in Fishtown transformed more dramatically - from a vestige of the 19th century working class German community to being repurposed as both a home and graphic design studio under Mike Ski's ownership, with plans to restore original window sizes while maintaining the historic structure.","context":["Historic preservation is a calling that trends towards tragedy. Advocates are often outgunned when it comes to financial resources and political support. Submitting a designation for addition to the local historic register—which would protect against demolition or exterior alteration without approval by the Philadelphia Historical Commission—is no guarantee of success. Even if there’s merit to the case, the commission can decide to shelve the matter because of a technicality, fear of repercussions, or respect for longstanding norms.\nOr in the case of the almost 150-year-old Fishtown church at 2345 E Susquehanna Avenue, protection may be withheld because the Historic Designation Committee doesn’t like the framing of an advocate’s argument.\nThat’s what happened when Oscar Beisert tried to designate the church last autumn. But his efforts were rebuffed because of his focus on figures in congregational history, without full articulation of the architectural merits of the structure. The nomination was tabled, pending revisions by the nominators.\nA vestige of the working class German community in 19th century Fishtown, The Fifth Reformed Dutch Church—now the Church of the Living Word—looked as if it would go the way of many such structures in Philadelphia’s hotter real estate markets.\n“I nominated this building because like a lot of churches in the area, as soon as they go up for sale, they get demolished and ticky-tacky turd houses would go in there,” said Beisert at a Fishtown Neighbors Association meeting on Tuesday night.\nBut this fate won’t befall 2345 E Susquehanna Avenue, because of a last-minute intervention by Mike Ski, owner of the graphic design studio True Hand. The artist and Fishtown resident purchased the building and plans to use it as both a home and a studio.\nDespite its lack of historic protections, Ski doesn’t envision any serious alterations. The only planned change would be to return windows that have been mostly covered to their original size.\n“It’ll be a lot brighter and nicer for the neighbors that way,” said Ski in an interview with PlanPhilly. “And it’ll be easier for us to keep eyes on the street.”\nSki made his case to the Fishtown Neighbors Association on Tuesday night because he needed a couple variances from the Zoning Board of Adjustment (ZBA).\nThe neighborhood is largely zoned RSA-5, for single family residential, which forbids multiple uses in one structure. True Hand also offers by-appointment tattooing, so Ski is required to get a variance to allow for “body art service” in the space.\nFishtown Neighbors Association is known for its animosity to variances for multi-family housing, which is often what old churches can be adaptively reused for. (See the long-burning controversy over nearby St. Laurentius.) Ski’s lawyer used that to his client’s advantage.\n“They [the church] were looking to sell and developers have been looking at this,” said Michael Phillips, the zoning lawyer representing Ski. “I can say that because I have represented developers who have looked at this to turn it into multi-family.”\nThen to much cheering from the crowd, he pronounced, “But Mike Ski is not going to turn it into multifamily!”\nSki assured neighbors that four of his three of his employees all lived within blocks of the church, and that the other worker walked to work despite living outside the neighborhood. By slaying the eternal bugbear of neighborhood politics—parking—Ski all but assured his victory.\nHe also told PlanPhilly that he’d canvassed the block to tell everyone about his plans and offered his soon-to-be neighbors tours of the interior. The current congregation of the church is tiny—eleven people according to testimony at the Historic Designation Committee—so few Fishtown residents are familiar with the interior of the church.\nNear neighbors voted 18-to-0 to support Ski’s request for the variances and the larger community voted 70-to-4 in his favor. On Wednesday, the Zoning Board of Adjustment granted his variance requests as well.\nFor his part, Beisert is very pleased by Ski’s plans. He believes the nomination helped ward off demolition-intent developers.\n“Most of Philadelphia’s great neighborhood cornerstones are owned by dwindling non-profits,” says Beisert. “A nomination ensures that the public good is at least considered, putting a temporary hold on demolition. In many cases being faced with the nomination forces them to examine their behavior.”\nBut Beisert said he’d still like to get the building protected. After all there’s no guarantee the next owner will be so preservation-minded.","History of St. Patrick’s Church\nSt. Patrick’s Church, a late Gothic Revival, also termed Neo-Gothic, style building was designed by J.J. McCarthy, a very important Irish architect, and was possibly built by local T. O’Brien, local architect and mason. The cornerstone of St. Patrick’s Church was laid on September 17, 1855, by Bishop Mullock and other distinguished clergy from Canada and the United States. American financier, Cyrus Field, contributed £1,000 to help with construction costs. Despite Field’s substantial contribution, financing the project proved difficult. Financing troubles combined with labour shortages resulted in the numerous construction delays and, consequently, the structure was not completed until 1881.\nIn 1864, nine years after the cornerstone was laid, work officially began on the structure with the construction the foundation from stone taken from the Southside Hills at Cudahy’s Quarry. Further problems prevented work on the project from advancing beyond the 1864 stage for a decade. Additional stone was donated in 1875 and construction began once more. Construction continued as funds and materials permitted and the church was completed in 1881. After more than two-and-a-half decades, St. Patrick’s Church was finally dedicated on August 28, 1881.\nAdditions have been made to the church in the years since its completion. The stations of the cross, depicting the Christ’s suffering at Easter, were erected in 1885. The presidential chair, created by a Mr. Klas, was presented in 1886. The original facing stone had to be replaced in 1911 due to deterioration and the bell tower was added in 1912. Two years later, in 1914, a spire was built and the next year a bell was imported from New York. The organ was installed as a part of the 50th anniversary celebrations in 1931. As well, numerous stained-glass windows have been donated in memory of various individuals. The older windows were imported from England where they were made by James Winston and Sons. The later windows added in 1961 were created by Yvonne Williams and Jeane McNichols of Toronto. There have also been numerous modernizations, such as lighting, and renovations arising out of Vatican II which brought many changes to the Roman Catholic worship services.\nArchival Moment: A bulletin from March of 1968.\nThe 19 m (62-foot) steeple was removed in the spring of 1997, as deterioration caused it to be a danger to the public. St. Patrick’s congregation decided to raise the $350,000 it would cost to replace the spire. As the original was unusable, an exact replica was ordered from Munn’s fabrication company in Utah. On November 27, 1997, the 11,500 pound replica steeple was hoisted into place.\nIn the fall of 1997 the Heritage Foundation of Newfoundland and Labrador declared St. Patrick’s Church a Registered Heritage Structure.\nHistory of our Patron Saint, St. Patrick\nPatrick isn’t really a Saint with a capital S, having never been officially canonized by Rome. And Patrick couldn’t have driven the snakes out of Ireland because there were never any snakes there to begin with. He wasn’t even the first evangelist to Ireland (Palladius had been sent in 431,about five years before Patrick went). Patrick isn’t even Irish. He’s from what’s now Dumbarton, Scotland (just northwest of Glasgow).\nPatrick was 16 years old in about the year 405, when he was captured in a raid and became a slave in what was still radically pagan Ireland. Far from home, he clung to the religion he had ignored as a teenager. Even though his grandfather had been a priest, and his father a town councilor, Patrick “knew not the true God.” But forced to tend his master’s sheep in Ireland, he spent his six years of bondage mainly in prayer. He escaped at the suggestion of a dream and returned home.\nPatrick was in his mid-40s when he returned to Ireland. Palladius had not been very successful in his mission, and the returning former slave replaced him. Intimately familiar with the Irish clan system (his former master, Milchu, had been a chieftain), Patrick’s strategy was to convert chiefs first, who would then convert their clans through their influence. Reportedly, Milchu was one of his earliest converts.\nThough he was not solely responsible for converting the island, Patrick was quite successful. He made missionary journeys all over Ireland, and it soon became known as one of Europe’s Christian centers. This, of course, was very important to fifth-century Christians, for whom Ireland was one of the “ends of the earth.”\nHistory of St. Patrick’s Convent\nOn 10th January 1856, four Presentation Sisters came from the Community at Cathedral Square in St. John’s to establish a Convent at Riverhead, in the West End of St John’s. Sr Mary Clare Waldron was appointed Superior. The next day, father Kieran Walsh celebrated Mass in the Convent Chapel. This house was cold and damp so in March 1880 the Foundation Stone was laid for a new building to better serve the needs of the Sisters and their charges. On the Feast of Corpus Christi, June 8, 1882, Bishop Thomas Joseph Power solemnly blessed the new St Patrick’s Convent and celebrated the first Mass in its Chapel.\nIn the beginning, the Sisters taught both boys and girls in their school. However, St Patrick’s eventually became an all girls’ school. The enrolment increased steadily and, 65 years after the Sisters opened their first school, a new school was opened. In 1921 a new St Patrick’s Convent School, erected as a Memorial to the men of the Parish who died in WWI, opened on Deanery Avenue. By the 1950s, it was realized that the current buildings were unable to adequately meet increasing educational needs. On 2nd October 1953, His Grace Most Reverend Patrick James Skinner blessed the cornerstone of the new St Patrick’s School on Patrick St. On 4th January 1954 Archbishop Skinner celebrated Mass on the main corridor of the new school and blessed the building.\nSt Patrick’s Convent School closed its doors for the last time in 1999. The building is now a private school. (Lakecrest)\nThe Presentation Sisters remained a presence in St Patrick’s Parish which was opened in 1882 and remained their home until 2016.\n(Source: Larry Dohey, Manager of Collections and Projects, The Rooms Provincial Archives)\nSt. Patrick’s Convent/School Closing – Sept 11, 2016\nMESSAGE OF APPRECIATION IN THANKSGIVING FOR PRESENTATION SISTERS ON THEIR COMPLETION OF 160 YEARS OF MINISTRY IN ST. PATRICK’S PARISH\nTruly, this is a bittersweet occasion. While we are celebrating the incredible impact the Presentation Sisters had on so many of us, we are also sad because after 160 years they will no longer have a presence at St. Patrick’s Convent.\nI am part of four generations who were taught by the Nuns, my mother, my sisters and I, my daughters, and my grandson all attended St. Patrick’s School, as did so many other family members in the West End. I’d like to share some of my experiences at school back in the early 40’s and 50’s.\nWe were very fortunate that Nano Nagle was a brave woman of faith who came here in 1883 with four nuns to establish schools in Newfoundland, and the rest is history. My generation was the last pupils to attend the Deanery Avenue School. Many of you will remember some of our teachers: Mother Francis, Mother John, Sister Agatha, and Sister Camilla. As children it seemed to us that the nuns knew everything; they were wonderful teachers, our spelling and writing had to be perfect and who will ever forget learning the “Time Tables”.\nAll of those skills stayed with us for our lifetime. We had all the core subjects and I even remember we were taught Latin for one year. Religion played a big part in our education, daily prayers, Sunday Mass, and you knew on Monday you would be questioned on the sermon. We were taught to respect ourselves and others and that God saw everything we did.\nThe Nuns were gifted in so many ways. They taught us how to knit, crochet, and do fancy work. It seems there was nothing they couldn’t do, and teach us to do. Perhaps one of their greatest contributions was in the field of music.\nSt. Patrick’s was so well known for its wonderful school choirs under the direction of Sr. Brendan, and the choir won so many awards and accolades over the years. Many students took their first piano and theory lesson in St. Patrick’s convent. The love of music wasnurtured in so many students under the careful instruction of those wonderful Nuns.\nI think we all realize how fortunate we were to get such a good education. While we may not have had all the options available to students today, we were enriched by the wonderful skills that were taught to us.\nThe Patrick Street School opened in 1954 and the nuns continued their work in education. Later things changed and with the end of denominational education, St. Patrick’s School closed in 1996. The sisters remained at the Convent and focused on other ministries; helping the sick, the needy, doing pastoral work and opening the Lantern and the Gathering Place.\nThe congregation is aging and some difficult decisions had to be made for the future, one of which was the closure of our Convent.\nSo, while we are sad that our sisters will not have a presence at St. Patrick’s, we are blessed and grateful for the wonderful years they were with us and the profound impact they had on so many lives. We will be forever grateful to them.\nIn closing, on behalf of St. Patrick’s Parish Family, I wish them well as another door in ministry opens for them. I want them to know they will be warmly welcomed back to visit at any time. Finally, I invite all of you to join us in the Parish Room for a reception to say good-bye personally.\nMary Skinner – Parish Council Representative\nEucharistic Liturgy of Thanksgiving Closing of St. Patrick’s Convent St. John’s, NL Canada September 11, 2016\nAddress by Sister Betty Rae Lee, NL Provincial Leader\nWe gather here today to celebrate the story of the relationship between the people of St. Patrick’s Parish and the Presentation Sisters for the past one hundred and sixty years. We honor the weaving of our lives together as a small, but also significant part of God’s unfolding dream and we express our deep gratitude to God and to each other for the blessings we have known throughout the years.\nThe Presentation Story, through which we are connected, began in the mind of God through the dream of a compassionate and visionary woman, Nano Nagle, our Foundress. Known as the “Lady of the Lantern” in Cork, she did all she could to alleviate the sufferings of Ireland’s poor in the 18th century.\nOur Presentation Newfoundland and Labrador story began in 1833 when four brave women from Galway, Ireland, Mary Bernard Kirwin, Xavier Mullowney, Magdalen O’Shaughnessy, and Xaverius Lynch arrived in St. John’s on September 21st of that year after a 25 day journey across the rough Atlantic seas.\nWe owe a debt of gratitude to our faith-filled ancestors and St. Patrick’s Parish plays an important part in our Irish/Newfoundland story. Can you imagine that this treasured booklet is 160 years old? It records our Presentation beginnings here at St. Patrick’s and I read, “On the 10th of January 1856 Sister Mary Clare Waldren, Sister Mary Ignatius Quinlan, Sister Mary Rose Mullally and Sister Mary Regis Halpin, Novice, came from the Motherhouse to establish a house of their Order at Riverhead, in this town, under the authority of the Right Reverend Dr. Mullock, Bishop of St. John’s.” God bless our noble pioneers.\nThe Annals further reveal the hardships under which the Sisters lived and, no doubt, the people of Riverhead were suffering much at that time also. So many young Sisters died because of the “provisional dwelling” in which they lived which was described as “miserable, cold, damp and uncomfortable”. There are many touching narratives of the faith and acceptance of these brave women. Of one such\nSister, Sister M. Agnes Kitchen who died at 36, it was written, “Her resignation to the Divine Will was admirable and her heroic patience edified all. She offered her life as a sacrifice to her Heavenly Spouse and calmly breathed her last sigh. Her life was holy. Her death tranquil.”\nSince these beginnings in 1856, 205 Sisters served at St. Patrick’s and over the years they shared their gifts and leadership as they ministered among you in the school and parish. Since most of our time here was connected with the young through the teaching ministry, these memories are most treasured. It is interesting to note that we have a list in our Archives naming every teacher who taught at St. Patrick’s from 1921-1999.\nSo many of these Sisters who taught at St. Patrick’s have since returned home to God but their memory remains in this place as does the energy of many of your relatives who were so good to them. Some women who lived and ministered among you have left our community to continue to live their Christian call in a different manner. Many others now live in other parts of our province and beyond and they carry with them the memories of their time among you. We cannot forget to acknowledge the women from this parish who, because of the faith, inspiration and encouragement of home and church community became members of our congregation. We acknowledged our beginning with four Sisters. Now we recognize the last community to reside at St. Patrick’s: Sisters Dorothy Baird, Dorothy Corrigan, Marie Furey, Mary Molloy, Frances Pennell and Patricia Whittle. Sisters Marie and Patricia will remain until the building is closed at the end of October this year. Some of you may not know the Sisters who are present in our Church today here today, who served in this parish so I would ask them to stand now. Hopefully some of you can get re-acquainted during the reception afterwards.\nAs we hold tenderly the lives of these 205 women in a treasured narrative, our hearts are grateful indeed.\nIn reflecting on the meaning of our common story within home, school and parish over these 160 years, we acknowledge the moments of joy in wonderful connections and the moments of sadness because of misunderstandings and hurts. And that is really the whole of life, the shadow and the sun, the darkness and the light of our lives, both calling out for reconciliation and celebration.\nIn God’s universal dream for all creation we were drawn together for a time. There is indeed pain for all of us in seeing the Convent close, yet we trust that the God\nwho has led us to this point will continue to be faithful to creating and nurturing life through the next use of this building.\nWe cannot announce today how the Convent will be used because an agreement for the use of the building, while in process, has not yet been finalized. Hopefully, by the end of October we will be in a position to make an announcement relative to the future of this wonderful and historic building. A new story is waiting to be told in this place.\nBefore concluding, I would like to say a special thank you to Archbishop Currie, Father Dohey, and to all of you who prepared for and participated in this beautiful Liturgy today and to all of you who have come to share this moment with us. This is a memory we will treasure. In our name I express deep appreciation to you, Mary Skinner, for your kind words of gratitude and we, in turn, extend a heartfelt thank you to the parishioners for your kindness, generosity and support over the years. You have allowed us to share in your lives and you have helped shape our congregational story.\nSo now the time has come for us to leave this sacred place\nStrong in this holy company of living faith.\nMay you know that absence is full of tender presence\nand that nothing is ever lost or forgotten.\nI invite the Sisters to stand and raise their hands over you as I pray a blessing from all our Presentation Sisters:\nWe pray a blessing on you as you journey onward from this moment. As you meet the poor, the sad, the stranger, may you see the face of Christ. May you remember that our love and appreciation for you are etched on our hearts in a bond that unites us forever. And may the power of God’s presence bless us all at this moment of leave taking.\nClosing of St. Patrick’s Convent"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c00a9da2-e953-4c7d-8f11-9a7a9af018ea>","<urn:uuid:3f4fbeac-b134-4f7b-9674-695f44d756dc>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What species can be targeted through bowfishing across different water bodies, and how does their behavior change with seasonal conditions?","answer":"In freshwater, common targets include common carp, grass carp, various gar species, and invasive Asian carp in river systems. In coastal waters, species like stingrays can be hunted, which are well-camouflaged on channel bottoms. During colder months, fish behavior changes significantly - most species become less active and may move to different areas within the estuary. For example, bass move from freshwater into brackish middle reaches, while estuary perch move from brackish areas toward the mouth for spawning. These fish often congregate in large numbers but can be challenging to catch during these seasonal movements.","context":["Scanning the horizon, I thought I saw a movement; there it was again. Just out of range, I slowly trudged forward. This time I was ready. Coming to full draw, I found my anchor and released. As the arrow found its mark all hell broke loose, water erupting-AHH! Bowfishing at its finest.\nI don’t often get a chance to travel for exotic game, basically anything that doesn’t live in Missouri is out of the picture. And once the spring turkey season goes out, it’s a long wait until deer season. Sure, I shoot 3-D, but it’s just not the same. But there is a cure for the summertime blues.\nIn many parts of the country the rivers, streams and lakes are teeming with bowhunting opportunities in the form of common carp, grass carp and several varieties of gar. And that is only the beginning. In the big river systems, though most folks aren’t fond of them, the invasive Asian carp provide more fun than should be allowed.\nIf you have never bowfished but always wanted to, and own a bow, I have good news-the expensive part is over. When getting started not much equipment is needed. In fact, complete kits ready to bowfish can be had for less than $40.\nSo what is included in this kit? An arrow, usually made of solid fiberglass to penetrate through the water. This arrow may or may not have any kind of fletching, so it is important to ensure your bow is set up for the heavier arrow. The kit will include a reel to retrieve your catch or arrow in case you miss and a length of line which attaches to the arrow and the reel. That’s it, no treestand, no cover scent, no camo.\nThe weather can change your equipment list too. I like to bowfish early when the water is still much too cool to wade in shorts. I wear chest waders, but that is the extent of the additional equipment. As you progress in your bowfishing endeavors you might opt for a different bow and a fancier retrieval reel.\nCurrently, I use a recurve bow with a 42-pound draw weight and a Zebco 808 reel spooled with 80-pound-test SpiderWire. The reel seat attaches in the stabilizer insert of the bow. With this rig the only thing you have to remember is to push the spool release button before you launch an arrow.\nTaking It to the Next Level\nKeith Riehn and the crew of Aim Low TV.com specialize in bowfishing.\n“Many bow anglers convert their old hunting bows for bowfishing, but most turn the poundage down to about 40 pounds,” said Riehn. “You can get as many as 100 shots in an afternoon of bowfishing, or you might go all day without a shot. It depends on the species you are after.”\nRiehn’s quarry is often the Asian carp that live in the Mississippi River system, but he and his partner Robin Parks travel to Texas each year to do battle with the giant gar that dwell there. It was from their specialized boats equipped with shooting decks and bright lighting for night shooting the duo arrowed a behemoth alligator gar on Sam Rayburn Lake. The fish was a new lake record and possibly the second largest ever taken with a bow and arrow. The gar weighed in at a whopping 244.5 pounds and measured over 8 feet long, a true monster.\nBowfishing the High Seas\nFreshwater isn’t the only game when bowfishing. Many coastal bowfishers have taken their sport to the open water. A vast array of species can be taken with archery gear. Becky Vannes of Open Season TV fame, which can be seen on the Pursuit Channel, was visiting family in Tampa, Fla. when she hooked up with a mutual friend and Wounded Warrior, Kelly Anderson and the gang from Tink’s Deer Lures for some stingray action.\nWhile it was Vannes’ first attempt at bowfishing, she is an accomplished hunter and archer, though she admitted, “It took me a long time to figure out how much to hold under the ray to connect.”\nFirst time bowfishers often learn the hard way that the light refraction of the water’s surface necessitates the need to aim below your intended target.\n“I was aiming three feet under the ray to hit them,” said Vannes.\nBy slowly cruising the flats in the shallow water, much like bowfishing freshwater species, Vannes and her crew stood on elevated platforms keeping an eye peeled for telltale signs of a ray.\n“It’s a lot like hunting in the woods. You really need to pay attention to what’s going on. It’s not like they are swimming around and we are flinging arrows at them. They are so well camouflaged on the bottom of the channel it is difficult to see them.” said Vannes. “I looked for their shape and occasionally I’d see a shadow that gave away their position.”\nGood Tasting Table Fare\nThough looked upon as trash fish, many of the species can be quite tasty at the dinner table. Carp were introduced to North America by the Europeans as a source of food, and if properly cleaned and prepared will rival many sport fish. Vannes claimed stingrays are a delicacy and taste very much like scallops.\nIf you are looking for a challenge, some off season practice and fun, give bowfishing a try. But don’t say I didn’t warn you, it can be very addictive.","There might be plenty of fish in that cold, clear water but they’re not always easy to catch. Here are a few ideas to make things easier.\nWith marine parks, rising fuel costs and declining fish stocks to contend with, simply heading out and catching a few estuary fish certainly isn’t getting any easier. To make matters worse, the cold, clear waters and westerly winds we endure through late Winter and Spring each year can be extremely testing.\nEven though everything can seem to be against us at this time of year, there is usually some quality fishing to be had in our estuaries if some thought and effort are applied.\nBeing aware of the movements of different species and the way they react to changes in weather and water quality is a starting point. Then we can work out the most effective ways to bring these fish undone.\nWater temperature is one of the more crucial factors to look at. Most species have a certain temperature range that they feel comfortable in. If temperatures suddenly rise or fall above or below that comfort zone, the fish will shut down and be extremely difficult to catch or move on to find temperatures that are more to their liking.\nFor example, through Summer our average upper estuary water temps hover between 23° and 26° and in late Winter can be 16° or 17°. So when the water drops below 16° fish may start to become inactive or move elsewhere within the estuary. Of course, the further south we go, the lower the average temperatures may be and the further north, the warmer.\nThose of us who fish from the shore or don’t have a sounder in the boat may not know the exact water temps but if you’re struggling to get a bite, dip your hand in the water and see how cold it feels. If it’s really freezing that could be why you’re not catching much.\nSo what to do ? Even water that’s one degree warmer is worth seeking out and that can often be found in areas that cop the most sunlight. A shallow bay with plenty of weed growth, to help insulate the warmth, could be the shot. Or even one side of a river that receives more sunlight than the other.\nOcean currents pushing water into the lower reaches of the system are another thing to consider. If there are freezing currents moving in along the coast, they’ll certainly penetrate the lower few kilometres of an estuary.\nOn the other hand, water moving down from the upper reaches on an ebbing tide could be colder than the average estuary temperature. So in major river systems like the Hawkesbury or the big northern rivers, the tides can play a large role in the temperature factor.\nCold water is one thing but when it’s crystal-clear as well, fishing can go from bad to worse. Already we are seeking out the more desirable temperature zones so now we’ll keep doing that as well as dealing with the clarity.\nMost species, especially bream and blackfish, are not easily fooled by our baits or lures if they can see the hooks, line or even the shapes of boats or people above them. Yes, fish can see us, just as we can see them. A big moving shape could be a predator in their eyes, so they’ll be very cautious if they can see you.\nThe first thing to consider when the water is too clear is to move upstream in search of a bit of colour. It doesn’t matter if you can see into the water a metre or so, but if it’s not crystal-clear it should be OK. If you are still trying to catch fish in the gin-clear stuff, use light lines or leaders, small hooks and more natural presentations like subtle lure colours or the freshest of baits.\nFishing during low light periods like dawn, dusk or at night can also be more effective in clear water. Low tide is also generally not as clear as high tide.\nBarometric pressure can influence fish behaviour as well, although it’s not always the most important factor to consider. However, a very low or rapidly falling barometer would normally mean that fish will shut down or become harder to catch.\nA steady reading, even if it’s a bit low, should be OK, as will a rising barometer. For those of us without a barometer, just keep an eye on the weather maps to see when the high or low pressure systems are moving over NSW.\nThe very worst scenario at this time of year is when a high pressure has just moved off the coast, causing strong winds to blow from the north-west, because the barometer is likely to be falling rapidly. Forget fishing when it’s like this.\nMoon phases also have some effect on estuary fishing, although that’s probably the last factor worth thinking about. The main thing I’ve got to say here is the worst part of the moon phase when the water is clear and cold is right on the bright full moon and one or two days either side of that. The more shallow and clear the water is, the worse the effect of bright moon light on estuary fish. This is no more evident than on the morning after a bright full moon.\nBream are available to estuary anglers right through the year. In my experience some of the biggest bream are caught at the coldest time of year but they certainly aren’t that easy to catch. Even if the bream are actively feeding, they generally won’t be as fast in their movements as they would be when water temps are higher.\nWhen using good quality natural baits like pink nippers, bloodworms or mullet gut, that factor doesn’t mean much. When lure casting however, it means a lot.\nIn short, this is the time to slow your lures right down. Move around the estuary fast to find the fish in the first place, but when you do hook a bream or at least locate some water that shows promise, work your lures slowly and methodically through the water column.\nThe majority of big bream will be closer to the bottom, so you can almost crawl a lightly weighted plastic across the bottom in a series of very small hops and short jerks.\nVery fine 2kg fluorocarbon leader and highly sensitive graphite rods are a must when it comes to this style of fishing. Bream tend to gently pluck or pick at the plastic rather than smash and grab as they do in Summer. So keep and eye on your rod tip and line and be ready for any sign of a timid bream bite.\nI’m using a Loomis dropshot DSR8200 for this style of plastics fishing and it has the perfect combination of a very light, sensitive tip with plenty of bream-pulling power in the lower section of the rod. The more alert you are as you fish, the more fish you’ll hook, especially when using super-sensitive tackle.\nBlackfish are one of the more abundant cold-water fish but they require pretty much the same approach as the bream. We may not be using light graphite rods and soft plastics for the blackfish, but that all-important fine fluorocarbon leader is every bit as crucial as it is for the plastics bream fishing.\nA common saying among luderick aficionados is ‘if you can see the fish, they can see you’. In such circumstances, good catches are rare. Better to come back on the bottom of the tide when the water may be slightly discoloured or when the sun is not high overhead.\nOften regarded as a Summer species, flathead are actually quite common at this time of year but they may be further up the system or perhaps residing in a smaller feeder creek that runs off the main part of the estuary.\nThey are nowhere near as finicky as bream or blackfish but you’ll still catch more by employing fine leaders and sensitive rods. Things can get a bit tricky with fine leaders for flathead. The best advice here is to take them nice and slowly towards a landing net.\nIf you try to rush proceedings with a flathead on the end of your light gear, the fish will most likely react by thrashing on the surface, cutting the line and swimming off with your lure.\nYou should also concentrate your flathead efforts later in the day in the shallows after the water has been warmed by the sun. Shallow, darker, muddy banks tend to fish well for flatties in Winter on sunny afternoons.\nMost estuary systems along the NSW coast are home to some sort of bass or estuary perch population. From about June through to September both species move further down the system seeking out desirable salinity levels for spawning.\nBass move from the freshwater into the brackish middle reaches of the system, while estuary perch move from the brackish areas down towards the mouth, sometimes within sight of the ocean.\nAt this time both species can congregate in large numbers but they aren’t always easy to catch. In reality, that’s a good thing because we wouldn’t like to see heaps of bass or EPs being caught and killed while they’re trying to make babies.\nJewfish, trevally and tailor are other common cold-water estuary fish. Of these, the tailor are the easiest to catch but overall the same angling theories should be applied if you want to succeed with these species.\nSeek out the fish’s natural comfort zone, avoid super-clear water and a falling barometer and don’t forget to use the lightest line you can get away with.\nWINTER ESTUARY TIPS\n• Avoid ultra-clear water, especially at high tide on bright sunny days and around the full moon in clear weather. Fish clear water at night, dawn, dusk or on cloudy days. If you can see fish, they can see you.\n• Low tide may have water that isn’t as clear.\n• Use fine lines and leaders.\n• Keep an eye on water temperature. Look for water that might be slightly warmer, such as over shallow mud flats or where warmer water upstream or from the ocean enters."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3895df99-4a5a-454c-877d-8280dba92d47>","<urn:uuid:63bc64d0-9b6a-47c4-9c65-b0f949a8349b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"During what timeline did the transition from hunter-gathering to agriculture occur, and what major societal changes did this bring?","answer":"The transition began about 40,000 years ago and culminated around 10,000 years ago, marking the 'Neolithic Revolution.' This shift led to humans becoming more sedentary, living in villages or cities, and the emergence of a farming class that tilled the soil. The change created potential for large grain stores that supported thriving urban cultures. For the following 10,000 years, until about 250 years ago, farming was the primary human occupation, with probably over 90 percent of people being tillers of the soil.","context":["Environment in Focus: Green Revolution\nThis content is not assigned to a topic\nTOPIC OF THE WEEK\nENVIRONMENT IN FOCUS:\n“Green Revolution” is a public relations term, probably coined in the 1960s by William Gaud, then Director of the U.S. Agency for international Development, that symbolized the modernization of agriculture in less industrialized countries by means of technological change rather than violent “Red Revolution” (Communism).\nThe essence of the Green Revolution was developing fertilizer-responsive varieties of wheat and rice that would increase national yields of these basic cereals.\nWith the increased national yields, promoters of this agricultural modernization saw the potential for reducing hunger, poverty, misery, and the potential for violent social upheaval that would threaten the geopolitical interests of the United States and other western powers.\nScientific research that underlay the green revolution is generally dated from the establishment of the Mexican Agricultural Program by the Rockefeller Foundation in 1943, and the successful technological changes were well in place by the 1970s in many parts of Asia and Latin America. Green revolution technology is now almost universally the “normal” way to do agriculture in all parts of the world except in parts of Africa.\nFor most of human evolutionary history, people were hunter-gatherers. They ate that which grew with little or no human management. Beginning about 40,000 years ago, and culminating about 10,000 years ago, however, people invented and increasingly used active management or “agriculture” to increase the quantity and security of food supplies, including grains, vegetables, and livestock. With this change, often called the “Neolithic Revolution,” modern humans became more sedentary and lived in villages or cities. A farming class tilled the soil and created the potential for large stores of grain that supported an increasingly thriving urban culture. For most of the past 10,000 years, until about 250 years ago, most (probably over 90 percent) people were tillers of the soil, and the primary human occupation was “farmer.”\nWith the exception of the last 100 years, the primary limitation on agricultural production was the supply of nitrogen to growing plants. The natural nitrogen cycle slowly takes the largely inert gas nitrogen (N2) from the atmosphere and fixes it into soil in forms that can be utilized as nutrients by plants.\nHuman activities, including the production of nitrogen fertilizers, combustion of fossil fuels, and other activities, however, have substantially increased the amounts of nitrogen fixed per year to levels that rival rates of natural nitrogen fixation. Increased levels of nitrogen fixation have already had effects on the atmosphere, terrestrial ecosystems, and aquatic ecosystems. Most of the effects are troublesome, but the still increasing uses of nitrogen fertilizer clearly have made agricultural ecosystems more productive. Nitrogen fertilizer, in a word, was essential to the productivity gains of the green revolution. As human population continues to expand, expansion of the use of nitrogen fertilizer, too, will occur.\nBefore 1900, the only major interventions people could do to increase supplies of nitrogen for crop plants lay in using manure, crop rotations with leguminous crops like clover, and mining of salts like sodium nitrate and natural materials like bird guano. These extra supplies, however, were expensive and limited in size. People were surrounded by billions of tons of inert nitrogen in the air, but it was impossible to bring this material to service of increasing yields in agriculture.\nRELATED NEWS IN FOCUS"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:523a029a-df5c-4743-b1b6-0b3d0e303757>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can you explain what causes lateral blasts in volcanic eruptions and compare their effects in rich versus poor countries?","answer":"Lateral blasts occur when confined gases under pressure are suddenly released sideways rather than vertically. At Mount St. Helens, this happened when a landslide removed pressure from the cryptodome, allowing previously confined gases and steam to explosively expand laterally instead of upward. The gases, which had been kept under 175 bars of pressure, rapidly expanded when released, forming a supersonic blast that carried fragments of rock, hot dome chunks, and debris in a dark gray cloud. The response to such volcanic events varies significantly between rich and poor countries. In rich countries like the USA, the Mount St. Helens eruption saw rapid mobilization of helicopters for rescue, emergency treatment availability, and long-term reconstruction of infrastructure. In contrast, poor countries like the Democratic Republic of Congo, during the Nyiragongo eruption, faced greater challenges with half a million people fleeing to neighboring Rwanda, where they lacked basic amenities like shelter, electricity, and clean water, requiring international aid agency intervention for basic necessities.","context":["The cryptodome growing within Mount St. Helens sowed the seeds of its own destruction. Had it been a small thing, it might have become a younger sibling to Goat Rocks. Pacific Northwesterners might have seen a few displays of volcanic fireworks, another dome added to the edifice, and a return to serenity. It hardly would have made the news.\nBut this dome, unlike Goat Rocks, kept growing, there beneath the surface. It set groundwater steaming. The hydrothermal system driven by its heat caused some pretty spectacular phreatic eruptions. It severely over-steepened the volcano’s north flank.\nAnd it kept growing, right up until the end, when an earthquake on the morning of May 18th, 1980, brought the whole thing down.\nThis is a story of seconds. A lot can happen in a few seconds. A whole mountain can change.\nBefore 8:32:11 am Pacific Daylight Time, the cryptodome had been following the usual trajectory of masses of magma hanging about under a volcano’s skin. The hot dacite was cooling down toward the point where liquids become solids. Various minerals were crystallizing as the magma cooled; toward the outside, where fresh dacite met old volcanic products and water circulated through the hydrothermal system, things had cooled a bit more than in the interior, and probably formed something of a dense crust with only minor, if any, vesicles. Other bits of the dome might have been a little more bubbly, with gasses forming more vesicles than at the relatively solid outer edges. But everything was under pressure – 175 bars of it – and so most gasses would have been dissolved within the melt. Even the water heated by the magma hadn’t boiled. Under that much pressure, it couldn’t get steamy.\nThis all sounds very quiet and happy, but gasses, including water vapor, that are under pressure are being forcibly confined to a small volume. They’re the kind of things that normally take up quite a bit of space. Give them an opportunity, and they’ll proceed to do so rather emphatically.\nOpportunity rang at 8:32:11 am PDT in the form of a magnitude 5.1 earthquake. It took about ten seconds for the unstable north face to begin sliding. Old rock, debris, domes, dirt, and glaciers careened down the mountainside, leaving a scarp 700 meters (2,297 feet) high, 1 kilometer (3,281 feet) wide, and just 20° off from vertical. All of that stuff had been keeping the lid on the cryptodome and its hydrothermal system. Now the pressure was off. And all of those gasses that had been kept down were now free to get out.\nThey didn’t go immediately. It took almost twenty seconds for the blast to begin after all that volatile material found itself freed. It’s possible the cryptodome and its hydrothermal system weren’t yet completely exposed, and expanding gasses might have been working their way through the remains of the north flank towards freedom. But there are also some complicated fluid dynamics to contend with. Even if the cryptodome had been instantly not-crypto, the blast would have taken some time – upwards of at least ten seconds – to form. A rarefaction (expansion) wave had to propagate, water needed to flash to steam, and dissolved gasses begin exsolving (coming out of solution), before an expansion wave involving more than one phase got round to propelling vapor and bits of volcano out.\nThis is all a complicated (yet greatly simplified) way of saying: water flashing to steam and gasses released from confinement blew the cryptodome apart.\nThere’s still some debate over whether the magmatic gasses within the cryptodome or the steam in the hydrothermal system caused the blast. The fact that so much of the dacite cryptodome got blown out suggests that its own gasses were major contributors. Regardless of which set of volatiles got things moving, once steam, magmatic gasses, bits of dome, and appreciable chunks of Mount St. Helens not stripped off by the landslide blasted through the base of the landslide scarp while more erupted from the top. Mind you, the landslide scarp wasn’t an immobile feature: it was slip-sliding down as block #2, leaving plenty of room for the expanding gasses to escape – sideways.\nThis is not usual behavior at volcanoes. But gasses that have been confined to a small space want to be in a large one, and they are not big on protocol. If a landslide leaves an exit in the side of a mountain, a lateral blast is the way they’ll go. Things were merely sonic to begin with, but as the blast reached the open air, it expanded supersonically. Fragments of old rock, hot chunks of the dome, and debris picked up on the way formed a roiling, boiling, dark gray cloud. Going up, gravity worked against it; going down, what was left of the ground interfered – but laterally, it found its way clear. It expanded more than 90° around the vent and sped down the mountain at speeds exceeding 600 km/h (373mph). In the valleys of the North and South forks of the Toutle River, the atmosphere was about to decide the fate of people who had, only seconds before, been enjoying a beautiful May morning.\nLipman, Peter W., and Mullineaux, Donal R., Editors (1981): The 1980 Eruptions of Mount St. Helens, Washington.

This led to lava spilling southwards in three streams.\nThe primary effects - The speed of the lava reached 60kph which is especially fast. The lava flowed across the runway at Goma airport and through the town splitting it in half. The lava destroyed many homes as well as roads and water pipes, set off explosions in fuel stores and powerplants and killed 45 people\nThe secondary effects - Half a million people fled from Goma into neighbouring Rwanda to escape the lava. They spent the nights sleeping on the streets of Gisenyi. Here, there was no shelter, electricity or clean water as the area could not cope with the influx. Diseases such as cholera were a real risk. People were frightened of going back. However, looting was a problem in Goma and many residents returned within a week in hope of receiving aid.\nResponses - In the aftermath of the eruption, water had to be supplied in tankers. Aid agencies, including Christian Aid and Oxfam, were involved in the distribution of food, medicine and blankets.\nMontserrat - Poor country case study\nMount St Helens - Rich country case study\nEffects - An earthquake caused the biggest landslide ever recorded and the sideways blast of pulverised rock, glacier ice and ash wiped out all living things up to 27km north of the volcano. Trees were uprooted and 57 people died.\nImmediate responses - helicopters were mobilised to search and rescue those in the vicinity of the catastrophic blast. Rescuing survivors was a priority, followed by emergency treatment in nearby towns. Air conditioning systems were cleaned after by clogged with ash and blocked roads were cleared. Two million masks were ordered to protect peoples lungs.\nLong-term responses - Buildings and bridges were rebuilt. Drains had to be cleared to prevent flooding. The forest which was damaged had to be replanted by the forest service. Roads were rebuilt to allow tourists to visit. Mount St. Helens is now a major tourist attraction with many visitor centres.\nIceland - Rich country case study\nIceland lies on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, a constructive plate margin separating the Eurasian plate from the North American plate. As the plates move apart magma rises to the surface to form several active volcanoes located in a belt running roughly SW-NE through the centre of Iceland. Eyjafjallajokull (1,666m high) is located beneath an ice cap in southern Iceland 125km south east of the capital Reykjavik\nIn March 2010, magma broke through the crust beneath Eyjafjallajokull glacier. This was the start of two months of dramatic and powerful eruptions that would have an impact on people across the globe. The eruptions in March were mostly lava eruptions. Whilst they were spectacular and fiery they represented very little threat to local communities,\nHowever, on 14th April a new phase began which was much more explosive. Over a period of several days in mid-April violent eruptions belched huge quantities of ash in the atmosphere.\nLocal impacts and responses:\nThe heavier particles of ash (such as black gritty sand) fell to the ground close to the volcano, forcing hundreds of people to be evacuated (immediate response) from their farms and villages. As day turned to night, rescuers wore face masks to prevent them choking on the dense cloud of ash. These ash falls, which coated agricultural land with a thick layer of ash, were the main primary effects of the eruption.\nOne of the most damaging secondary effects of the eruption was flooding. As the eruption occurred beneath a glacier, a huge amount of meltwater was produced. Vast torrents of water flowed out from under the ice. Sections of embankment that supported the main highway in Southern Iceland were deliberately breached by the authorities to allow floodwaters to pass through to the sea. This action successfully prevented expensive bridges being destroyed. After the eruption, bulldozers were quickly able to rebuild the embankments and within a few weeks the highway was reconstructed.\n800 people evacuated\nHomes and roads were damaged and services (electricity & water) disrupted\nLocal flood defences had to be constructed\nCrops were damaged by heavy falls of ash\nLocal water supplies were contaminated with fluoride from the ash\nDrop in tourist numbers - affected Iceland's economy as well as local people's jobs and incomes\nRoad transport was disrupted as roads were washed away by floods\nAgricultural production was affected as crops were smothered by a thick layer of ash\nReconstruction of roads and services was expensive\nOver 8 days - some 100,000 flights were cancelled\n10 million air passengers affected\nLosses estimated to be £80 million\nIndustrial production halted due to a lack of raw materials\nFresh food could not be imported\nSporting events such as the Japanese Motorcycle grand prix, Rugby leagues challenge cup and the Boston Marathon were affected\nInternational impacts and responses:\nThe eruption of Eyjafjallajokull became an international event in mid-April 2010 as the cloud of fine ash spread south-eastwards toward the rest of Europe. Concerned about the possible harmful effects of ash on aeroplane jet engines, large sections of European airspace closed down. Passenger and freight traffic throughout much of Europe ground to a halt.\nThe knock-on effects were extensive and were felt across the world. Business people and tourists were stranded unable to travel in to or out of Western Europe. Industrial production was affected as raw materials could be flown in and products could not be exported by air. As far away as Kenya, farm workers lost their jobs or suffered pay cuts as fresh produce such as flowers and bean perished, unable to be flown to European supermarkets. The airline companies and airport operators lost huge amounts of money.\nSome people felt that the closures were an over-reaction and that aeroplanes could fly safely through low concentrations of ash. However, a scientific review conducted after the eruption concluded that under the circumstances it had been right to close the airspace. Further research will be carried out as a long-term response to find better ways of monitoring ash concentrations and improving forecast methods.\nMt St Helens Volcanic Eruption 1980\nVolcano Learning Zone > Volcanic eruption Casestudies > Mt St Helens\nWhere is the volcano?\nMt St Helens (8365 ft , 22,550m) is in the Cascade Volcanic Range in Washington State, USA. The Cascade Range has 160 volcanoes and Mt St Helens is considered the most active, and lies 100 miles south of Seattle and 50 miles from the coast at Portland.\nWhy is there a volcano here?\nMt St Helens is a stratovolcano within the Cascade Volcanic range in Washington State and had been dormant for 100 years prior to 1980. As an Eastern remant of the Pacific Plate, the Juan da fuca plate,has subducted beneath continental North America the Cascade volcanic chain has formed. The Mt.St.Helens volcano has been active for around 40,000 years but the now damaged cone we see today has formed over the last 2,200 years\nThe volcano is highly explosive and erupts in the Plinian style like Vesuvius. Sudden violent explosions are accompanied by towering clouds of hot ash, dust and rocks thrown high into atmosphere. Pyroclastic flows and volcanic mud flows called Lahars flow down the mountain at speed and consume the surrounding landscape. lavas from basalt to andesites have been erupted forming layers of ash and lava. In many stratovolcanoes a central summit crater has dome of dacitic lava which is squeezed out of the main vent , similar to Montserrrat. In 1980 this did not occur and instead a crypto dome formed (crypto means hidden) causing the Northern slope of the volcano to bulge and grow. From mapping the deposits around the volcano it seemes that lateral blasts and side domes were not unprecedented.\nSequence of Events\nOn May 18 1980 Mt.St.Helens produced an enormous lateral blast which obliterated everything for 20 miles north of the volcano. The summit decreased from 2930m to 2550m and a gaping crater 1.5km wide was created.\nThe sequence of events that occured had not been witnessed before as until then geologists had always seen volcanoes erupt upwards but this was different this was sideways!\nIn March 1980 earthquakes and a phreatic(steam) 2km eruption column alerted the USGS that the volcano was certainly waking up. Throughout the spring the mountain continued to splutter and steam the northern side of the mountain was bulging out by 1.5m/day. A 5 miles exclusion zone was placed around the volcano and famously Harry Truman owner, of the Spirit lake lodge resort, refused to leave.\nOn the morning of May 18 Geologist David Johnson was on a ridge 10km north of the volcano when a 5.1 earthquake struck. Suddenly the bulge on the north side of the volcano slid downwards in a massive landslide at 300km/hour and crashed into Spirit lake causing an enormous wave of water the rest of the landslide ploughed down the Tootle river valley and mixed with vast quantities of lake water and ice . Davids last message was to his colleagues in the nearby Vancouver USGS base ( not Canada) \"Vancouver,Vancouver .. this is it!\"\nThe landslide uncorked the magma in the crypto dome and released the pressure. The gas in the magma instantly expanded and shattered the rocks at supersonic speed creating a lateral of blast ash and hot rocks which overtook the landslide at reached speeds of 1,000km/hour (670 miles/hour) . The blasts power has been estimated at 500 times that of Hiroshima. 600km2 of forest was blown away and trees combed down like hair, sap exploded in trees in the intense heat. Trees up to 20 miles away were engulfed in the blast 4 times the distance of the exclusion zone.\nThe third string to Mt.St.Helens bow was a 19km (12miles) high eruption cloud which powered vertically out of the volcano in a matter of minutes. The cloud turned day to night and ash fall was heavy. Lightning crackled around the cloud.\nMudflows or Lahars formed within minutes of the eruption. lake water,melted glacier ice, hot ash and debris all combined to send hot ( 29-33C) cement like flows down the Toutle river. Pyroclastic flows started to form from the crater just after the blast as fresh magma came into contact with the air. Material appeared to overflow the craters edge and flow down the Toutle valley as a grey turbulent cloud.\nHarry Truman and David Johnson along with 55 other people did not survive. Both have had ridges named after then within the Mt.St.Helens national monument. The area within the monument is being left to recover naturally. Within 8km of the volcano all trees were obliterated, from 8km to 30km flattened and outside this dead but left standing. Outside the boundary logging companies have replanted trees.\nMount St. Helens showed significant activity on March 8, 2005, when a 36,000-foot (11,000 m) plume of steam and ash emerged. A new dome is growing and will eventually fill the 1980 crater.\nEffects and Aftermath\nRescue helicopters looking for survivors were grounded or could not land due to ash. Ash removal from roofs nad roads was costly and lengthy costing 2 million dollars just in one town(Yakima)\nAll volcanoes in the Cascades are monitored by the Cascades Volcanic Observatory CVO part of the United States Geological Survey USGS from their base in Vancouver,not Canada but Washington State USA. On March 27th 1980 a phreatic eruption signalled the begnning of an active phase. The CVO moved in a team of Geologists to monitor the volcano.Small eruptions of steam and ash blasted from the old summit dome continued and attracted attention from the press and tourists. Evacuation plans were prepared and roads closed leading to the volcano. As the mountain swelled with magma, and bulged outwards at a rate of 1.5m/day,it was obvious that the Spirit Lake area to the north of the volcano needed to be evacuated. The Washington State Governor placed a 5 mile red zone around the summit only Harry Truman an 83 year old resort owner refused to move. When the volcano erupted on May 18th the lateral blast extended 20 miles 4 x the exclusion zone.\nTry our other Mt St Helens entry , World volcano section or Volcanic Hazards page."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9b4d2e16-38fd-4724-9209-505e732a19a6>","<urn:uuid:ad1fb6d2-8904-43cc-8096-c79f114f653a>"],"error":null}

Choosing a shade that you like is important, so that you don’t get bored too soon and give up on such a super easy and fun project.\nCool Tip – Go for super chunky yarn and really thick needles for knitting hats in a couple of hours or less!\n4. Tapestry needle\nThe Beanie Knitting Technique\n1. Cast on 80 stitches for an average sized adult hats for females and/or males. For a smaller head, cast on 74-76 stitches.\n2. Row 1 – Knit across the entire length. Turn your work.\n3. Row 2 – If you desire a stockinette stitch hat with a cute, curled-up brim (girls love those!), purl this row. Otherwise, for a garter stitch hat, knit across again.\n4. Keep alternating between knit and purl rows (or just knit rows), till your hat measures up to inches or more.\n5. End at a purl row (if doing a stockinette hat), or plain knit for garter, and start the decrease to shape the crown of your lovey, soft winter hat.\n6. Knit 8 stitches, then knit two stitches together. Continue till the row ends. Turn.\n7. Purl/knit as per your pattern.\n8. Knit 7 stitches, then K2Togh again till the end of the row. Turn your work.\n9. Again, purl or knit as per your hat’s design.\n10. Continue decreasing in this manner, with one less stitch in every even row and knit/purl every odd numbered row, till 16 or less stitches are left on your knitting needles.\n11. Now, cut your yarn, leaving at leats 18 inches of a tail – for sewing up your hat.\n12. Thread the yarn needle with the tail end and by working from right to left, lift stitches from the needles and pull them together on the thread.\n13. Pull tight to close up the hole on top and tie on the worn side of the hat.\n14. Using the mattress stitch and the tail end of the yarn, sew the hat close by picking and stitching across the corner stitches. The mattress stitch is perfect for creating an invisible seam for your hat.\n15. Weave in the end in the wrong side of your work and you’re done with a beautiful, soft hat to keep you warm and toasty in the winters!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_intent","category_name":"information_seeking"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3e4b7123-ef11-4667-b052-f37fe5d8d40f>","<urn:uuid:f0ee6970-c31e-467c-9aad-26850fac4c9b>"],"error":null}
