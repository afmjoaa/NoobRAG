{"question":"Could you compare the innovative techniques for creating atmospheric effects in Barratt's 'Sound of Movement' project versus the Bristol Old Vic's historical stage machinery? Both English, but centuries apart.","answer":"These two English approaches to creating theatrical atmosphere used very different techniques. Barratt's 'Sound of Movement' project creates atmospheric effects through live collaboration between musicians and dancers - for example, in 'Living Rock', percussionist Tatsuya Nakatani produces sounds simulating ocean waves and wind while Barratt's movements illustrate natural forces, with effects like air rushing through a cymbal to represent wind. In contrast, the Bristol Old Vic relied on mechanical stage devices from the 19th century, notably their Thunder Run - a system where wooden beech balls of varying sizes would roll down a sloped wooden trough in the attic to create realistic thunder sounds. This Thunder Run, one of only four remaining in UK theatres, was used as recently as 2016 in a production of King Lear and represents one of the oldest surviving examples of historical theatrical sound effects.","context":["Claire Elizabeth Barratt: Blurring Boundaries\nby Steven Maginnis\nIn the arts, where creators and spectators alike have become used to accepting different media in different spaces, Claire Elizabeth Barratt seeks to challenge such a standard. A choreographer and a dancer by training, Barratt has focused her energies on blurring -- and sometimes eliminating -- boundaries that separate motion from music, painting, and drama. She is constantly exploring how movement can go beyond conventional dance, and she wishes to go against common ideas of where movement art should be performed and for how long. She also wants to make the audience part of the experience and eliminate the fourth wall between spectator and performer.\nCurrently, Barratt runs Cilla Vee Movement Projects, a company of performers that explores the possibilities of blending motion with other art forms. Two complementary projects, Motion Sculpture Movement Installations and Sound of Movement, comprise Cilla Vee’s main ongoing work.\nGrowing up in Chester, England, Barratt started performing for family and friends when she was only five; by eleven, she was in a sacred music and dance group that toured churches in Great Britain. Barratt came to appreciate how different artistic media could be melded together; her mother was a musician, while her father wrote literature. Barratt was eventually inspired to seek out a medium that would allow her to explore the incorporation of different art forms, settling on dance. She proved to be adept at choreography, and in 1990 she arrived in the United States to pursue a dance career.\nThroughout the nineties, Barratt honed her skills by co-directing the Circle Modern Dance ensemble in Knoxville, Tennessee. She also choreographed original dances for various other companies in Tennessee and in North Carolina, as well as classic works such as “Madame Butterfly” and “Carmen” for the Knoxville Opera Company.\nSeeking a change in direction, Barratt moved to New York in 2002 and founded Cilla Vee Movement Projects. The form of moving sculpture they perform, unlike the robotic mime acts common on New York’s streets, is far more subtle. As a “motion sculpture” piece, Barratt slowly changes poses in a quiet metamorphic style, costumed appropriately to the setting.\n“The Motion Sculpture Project originated with the idea of just purely the movement style itself,” Barratt says in her romantically accented English. “It was inspired by modeling for art classes, and feeling literally like a piece of sculpture.” She would hold poses for thirty seconds while the artists sketched her gesture as quickly as possible without great detail before she changed her pose.\n“I kind of expanded on that idea of slowly melting and morphing and shifting from one position to another like a slowly moving sculpture. Then it expanded into this whole concept of different contexts to put it in, so it can be defined very specifically toward a certain theme or a certain environment to create a whole world.”\nOne example of Barratt’s creativity involved an art gallery exhibition that emphasized surrealist painting and sculpture. The show was held at the Williamsburg Art and Historic (WAH) Center in Brooklyn. To complement the environment, Barratt devised alien-like creatures of different colors; she and three other women, costumed and made up in shades of green, purple, orange, or brown, slowly changed poses and blended with the surrounding art pieces. Their skillful, metamorphic moves allowed them to be a focal point of the exhibition while still incorporating themselves into the environment.\nHer more common motion sculpture installations are less surreal. A popular one is “Elegant Venture Cocktail,” which she has performed both solo and as a collaborative effort. Wearing an elaborate cocktail dress, Barratt quietly moves and shifts with a champagne glass in hand, integrating herself seamlessly in her surroundings -- either in a conservatory or in front of an art museum, both places where an elegant cocktail reception would naturally occur.\nWith her troupe, though, Barratt creates the illusion of a real high society affair, employing ten performers who come in and leave the scene at random. “We drink real champagne,” Barratt says with a laugh, and some of us will get a little tipsy -- then later we’ll rejoin the scene once we’ve regained our composure.”\nIn the cast version of “Elegant Venture Cocktail,” live classical musicians are included in the scene; the other performers move to the rhythm of the music, and the musicians are part of the whole fabric by integrating themselves with the tableau by playing pieces appropriate to the highbrow scene. The music is always an important factor in Claire Barratt’s work; not only does a live musician add to the scene, he is part of the greater whole. “If you just play music on a CD,” Barratt explains, “it’s just background music; it’s not really part of the work.”\nMany of Barratt’s tableaux come alive on video, where she experiments with light and color to create what might be called a living painting. “Silver” characterizes her desire to integrate herself in her surroundings and reflect the moment -- literally. Costumed in silver clothing and makeup, Barratt gently extends her arms and slowly positions her torso to catch the glittering rays of the rising sun against her body.\nAs she moves like a ballerina in slow motion, vibrant shades of red and orange contrast vividly against metallic silver, while the hushed noise of the street below sonically complements the visual representation of the dawn. Thus, movement and sound are together awakened.\nIn other works, Barratt will create a tableau of her own making to complement her choreography, such as in “November Frost,” a video work borrowing from Japanese autumn motifs. Colored and costumed in red, she slowly turns in a heavy, descending manner against a bleak landscape to convey the desolation of late autumn; twisted branches poke out of a surreal landscape of muted shades of brown and dark green that reflect the Japanese concept of nature as one harmonious whole.\nHer live installations, however, are where Barratt strives to include the existing setting as an integral part of her performances. Here the “motion sculpture” is designed as an extension of the space it occupies to involve the audience as much as to blend into the environment, eliminating the boundaries between audience and spectator. “It’s not really a performance,” Barratt explains. “The audience doesn’t have to sit and watch it from beginning to end, then it’s over and they clap and go away. It’s like it’s a part of the environment that could exist there forever, for all everyone knows.”\nThe spectators are encouraged to view the piece for as long as they wish, from any angle they choose. From Barratt’s view, the spectators are part of the work because they share the scene with the performers. Spectators are encouraged to interact with the performers as well, and Barratt’s troupe is trained to respond accordingly, the way their characters might be expected to react.\nWhile the performances themselves may depend on spontaneity, the rehearsals leave nothing to chance. Barratt and her repertory company will spend up to twenty minutes warming up by relaxing their muscles, then spend an hour perfecting movements appropriate to their characters and environment, without any distractions. Although she and her performers are prepared to interact with spectators, they usually don’t get the opportunity; Barratt concedes that most people are too polite to step into the realm of the motion sculpture piece.\nChildren, of course, tend to be the exception. They normally walk into the tableau, as when the Cilla Vee troupe was performing at one venue, costumed inside striped tubes. The children, puzzled by the tubes, walked up to them, and the performers reacted by wrapping themselves around the kids or rubbing up against them, sometimes showing their faces from inside and staring at the kids, responding to and rewarding their curiosity.\nBarratt goes further with her live staged pieces, as she and her company did when they collaborated with Chashama, an organization that supports artists and performers outside the mainstream. Barratt used a midtown Manhattan storefront run by Chashama for a series of window exhibitions with sets and characters conceived to complement each other with live music to add to the atmosphere.\nOne such piece, “Carmen Miranda Tropical Installation,” presented Barratt sensuously stretching and reclining on a Caribbean beach with festive tropical music in the forefront. Spectators were invited inside for refreshments to be part of the fiesta. They tended to stay outside, however, for her edgier and more compelling window displays. One such piece, her multimedia installation “Between MA and a Soft Space,” may be her most ambitious motion sculpture work of all.\nBased on the Japanese concept of “MA,” the idea that the empty area between objects and sound has its own importance, “Between MA and a Soft Space” features a shapeless, formless plateau in which Barratt and her troupe convey a separate life in the void to show that such dead space isn’t really dead at all. The performers, costumed in white, stretch and roll slowly across the stage to define the space in between objects and illustrate the life in that void.\nGuitarist David Beardsley, meanwhile, harmonizes with their motions with a microtonal buzz, his notes changing as slowly and as slightly as the performers’ movements, fleshing out the silence with a subdued drone. The awareness of the void in between objects and sounds are built on even more by painter Lara Hanson, who captures the Cilla Vee troupe’s gestures as quickly as possible -- which merely intersects with the performers by becoming part of the movement; the painter, after all, is moving too. The gesture paintings slowly accumulate on a wall, building up with intensity; space is fleshed out and expanded, the inference being that it could go on forever.\nBarratt’s “Sound of Movement” project strives to bring live music and dance together to work as a unified whole rather than as separate parts that share the same space. In Barratt’s own words, “The ‘Sound of Movement’ is about working with live music as real sound in real time. The focus is on equal collaboration between the movement and sound artists...[The] principal is that of being mutually independent as a strong solo entity, yet interweaving to create a fabric which is doubled in its strength and diversity.”\n“Living Rock,” inspired by the volcanic rock along the shoreline of Japan and including the percussive work of Tatsuya Nakatani, is one such work. Here, percussion sketches out plants growing through the earth below rock formed from fire, while Barratt illustrates the forces of nature through broad, chaotic swings followed by moderate thrusts to show plants taking root and prospering in such an unforgiving landscape.\nFire, meanwhile, is represented by the artist costumed in red fabric and moving slowly. As the sounds crash through the atmosphere to simulate ocean waves breaking against the shoreline, Barratt stretches out forcefully across the stage. The work culminates with a rush of air through a hole in a cymbal while Barratt relaxes her lungs with breath to simulate the wind dispersing the rock fragments and returning them to the sea.\nMany times, though, a “Sound of Movement” piece can simply be improvised on the spot, with a theme or idea supplied at the last minute by audiences during the show. “Sometimes it’s nice not to have a theme, to just respond to the energy of the environment,” Barratt says. “You just pick up something from that second, and it’s not really related to anything solid or tangible at all.” Sometimes a dancer and musician will simply look at an image -- like two circles on a piece of paper -- and simultaneously illustrate in it in sound and movement. “You just catch something, and you just go with it, and it kind of bypasses the whole cerebral thing.”\nBarratt’s devotion to breaking boundaries and unifying different artistic media go beyond her own projects. In January 2003, she and Mr. Nakatani founded H&H Productions (for heaven and hell) to encourage more creativity in the performing arts. Their studio in the Mott Haven section of the Bronx is used regularly for experimenting with new musical compositions and creating dance works and even releasing new recordings.\nHere, Barratt continues to cross-pollinate music, movement, and fine art to express her belief that creation itself -- the act of nature begetting life, and allowing art to be drawn from life -- is art, just as art is a form of creation. All art, she insists, stems from life and the creation of life, hence the punning name of her company, Cilla Vee (or c’est la vie), which draws from life as a basis for creating a work of art.\nWith so much life to observe and take in from the streets and squares of New York, it seems that Barratt, through her solo and collaborative projects, will continue to make art out of life and fuse disparate art forms into single works for some time to come.\nRead related stories in the press and see what others are saying.

Phipps (1867 renovations)\nFirst Opened: 30th May 1766 (257 years ago)\nAlso Known As: Bristol Old Vic\nFormer Names: The Bristol Theatre\nTelephone: 0117 949 3993\nAddress: King Street, Bristol, BS1 4ED\nThe Bristol Old Vic’s Theatre Royal is the United Kingdom’s oldest continuously operating theatre, having opened its doors in May 1766. At the time of opening it did not possess the royal patent required for the public performance of plays, so productions were disguised as concerts and the theatre’s entrance was not directly accessible from the street to minimize unwanted attention.\nArchitect Thomas Paty supervised the construction of designs by David Garrick’s carpenter at the Theatre Royal in Drury Lane, James Saunders. The theatre was closely modeled on the Richmond Theatre in Surrey (1765) for which Saunders had provided drawings, and London’s Theatre Royal in Drury Lane (1674 building). The Bristol Old Vic is a rare example of an 18th century horseshoe theatre.\nThe Foundation Stone was laid on 30th November 1764, with the intent of opening the theatre the next Summer. The 50 subscribers who had each invested £50 to fund the theatre’s building received a silver ticket which granted them “sight of any show at the theatre for the rest of their lives”.\nThe Circle, as originally built, consisted of nine boxes which were named for dramatic poets: Shakespeare (center box), with Johnson, Vanburgh, Row, and Steele to the right; and Fletcher, Congreve, Otway, and Cibber to the left. The eight upper side boxes, on either side of the Gallery, bore the names Garrick, Witcherley, Addison, Farquhar, Dryden, Lee, Shadwell, and Colman. The Pit (Orchestra/Stalls level) accommodated 320, the Gallery 530, and the Boxes 750, giving a total seating capacity of 1,600.\nMessrs. Powell, Arthur, and Clarke took a lease of seven years on the theatre and presented its opening night in late May 1766. In the absence of the royal patent required for public performance of plays (Licensing Act 1737), the opening night was described as a concert “with a specimen of rhetoric”. Prolific actor David Garrick delivered the evening’s prologue. Patrons could not directly access the theatre from the street and instead had to knock on the door of a house belonging to a man named Mr Foote and walk through his backyard to reach the theatre’s entrance.\nIn 1777 the theatre was awarded a royal patent, reopening on 30th November 1778 as the Theatre Royal, Bristol. John Palmer, a brewer and chandler from the neighboring town of Bath who had invested in the theatre there and secured its royal patent in 1768, took out a 20 year lease on the theatre. Palmer obtained the royal patent and completed work in the Gallery (conversion of the upper boxes into a full gallery, with new raised ceiling, seating 550, for a total seating capacity of 1,620). The theatre was run jointly with the Theatre Royal in Bath, a single company performing at each theatre on different days. By 1785 Palmer had transferred his licences to actor William Wyatt Dimond.\nThe relationship with the Bath Theatre Royal was disbanded in 1817 when the theatre was acquired by Mr John Boles-Watson, who had an unsuccessful run at the theatre and in March 1819 the lease reverted to William MaCready the elder. MaCready was an actor with little experience of management and so entrusted management to his son, William Charles MaCready. In August of 1819 the theatre was fitted with “coal-gas” lighting, replacing the earlier oil lamps. The theatre had little success at the time but its fortunes slowly turned-around in the late 1840s and 1850s under the management of his widow, Sarah MaCready. In September 1845 Sarah “Mrs Mac” MaCready became lessee and manageress of both the Bristol and Bath Theatre Royals. Mrs MaCready died 9th March 1853 and she was buried in the cathedral in Bristol, next to her husband. MaCready’s son-in-law, James Chute, took over following Sarah’s death, however Chute lost interest when he opened the New Theatre Royal Bristol on Park Row. in 1867 well-known theatre architect C.J. Phipps oversaw the removal of the forestage, a fire curtain created upstage of the Proscenium Arch, and installation of a new ventilator amidst a new star-studded auditorium ceiling.\nThe 20th century saw a number of failed attempts to revive the theatre, and by the 1930s it was in a state of disrepair. In 1942 it was sold for conversion into a banana-ripening warehouse. Public outcry led to the suggestion that a revived theatre might emulate the recent success of London’s Old Vic theatre – that it could become Bristol’s “Old Vic”. In 1943 the forerunner of today’s UK Arts Council supported the reopening of the theatre, and following the end of the war experimented with the idea of subsidizing a regional theatre by sending an acting troupe from London’s Old Vic to Bristol. The Bristol Old Vic company went on to present many successful seasons at the theatre throughout the 1940s and 1950s, and the regional subsidy model was rolled-out across the UK.\nIn 1963 the Arts Council’s role was taken over by Bristol City Council and the Bristol Old Vic became fully independent of its London namesake.\nIn 1970 a major refurbishment was begun however ran out of money before it could be completed. Coopers’ Hall (1743-44), in front of the theatre on King St and operating as a fruit and vegetable market at the time, became the theatre’s new Front of House space while the previous entrance area was converted into a studio theatre. To enable the theatre to house elaborate sets and more efficiently transfer a show’s sets directly to other theatres, the 18th century stagehouse was demolished and rebuilt with a new fly tower, the stage was leveled, and the 19th century stage machinery underneath the stage removed. Money ran out before the auditorium’s seating could be adjusted to take account of the changed sightlines effected by the now level stage, resulting in large parts of the new stage not being visible from many of the old seats. Additionally, the building changes badly affected the theatre’s acoustics. There was no money available to fix the multiple issues and they persisted for over 30 years.\nIn 2007 public concern for the theatre’s survival resulted in formation of a new board of trustees. With the theatre dark by this time, the new board of trustees carried out essential remedial works before embarking on the first phase of a major refurbishment, completed in 2012. The £12 million project saw the original geometry of the Georgian theatre restored, auditorium seating reconfigured and replaced, new rehearsal facilities added, and improvements made backstage.\nFollowing a period of consultation and careful design, in 2016 the major refurbishment’s second phase broke ground. The refurbishment was completed in late 2018, seeing all Front Of House areas reconfigured and improved with the 18th century Coopers’ Hall being returned to its original use as an events space.\nThe theatre boasts a large scenic workshop with direct access to the stage, situated at the House Right side of the auditorium. The workshop space was built out as part of the 1970s changes to the theatre. Workshop facilities include a full-size paint frame, operated from the workshop floor with the paint frame disappearing into a slot in the workshop floor. Although still counterweighted it is now electrically, as opposed to manually, operated. For the duration of the 2016-2018 Front Of House refurbishment the workshop was tastefully reimagined as the “Backstage Bar” and temporary theatre entrance, with the paint frame forming a natural division of the space between audience circulation and seating/display areas.\nThe Bristol Old Vic actively references its history for learning and educational purposes, and throughout the building there are interesting displays pointing out period features. The Gallery retains some of its original bench seating, parts of which were frequented by soliciting prostitutes in the 18th century. A 1981 scale model of the original stagehouse and 19th century stage machinery is a popular display piece with audiences. Replica 19th century rain and wind machines have been created for educational purposes, however the pièces de résistance is the 19th century “Thunder Run” which still exists in the attic above the auditorium. The Thunder Run created the sound of rumbling thunder when smoothed beech balls of varying diameter were released down a gently sloping wooden trough. It was last used as a stage effect in a production of King Lear in 2016. There are only four Thunder Runs remaining in UK theatres: the Bristol Old Vic, the Globe Theatre in Plymouth, Her Majesty’s Theatre and the Playhouse Theatre, the latter two located in London. The Bristol Old Vic’s Thunder Run is the oldest and is located above the auditorium for maximum effect (the London Thunder Runs are located backstage).\nOver the centuries many actors have sneaked-up to the theatre’s attic and its walls are covered in their signatures and sound bites representing over 250 years of theatrical performances at the Bristol Old Vic.\nThe theatre runs regular tours, generally Thursday and Saturday mornings, which last one hour and during current Covid restriction costs £50 for a group of up to 6. Spaces regularly included on the tour: the new Bristol Old Vic foyer; the Georgian Auditorium, Stage, Gallery, and Pit passages; the Paintshop and Paint Frame; the Weston Studio; and Coopers’ Hall. Access is subject to theatre operations at the time of your tour and some areas may be restricted. Check the theatre’s website for further details and online booking.\nThe theatre has previously participated in the annual Bristol Open Doors event and may do so again in the future.\nPhotographs copyright © 2002-2023 Mike Hume / Historic Theatre Photos unless otherwise noted.\nText copyright © 2017-2023 Mike Hume / Historic Theatre Photos.\nFor photograph licensing and/or re-use contact me here .\n|Follow Mike Hume’s Historic Theatre Photography:|"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:dfd545cb-1697-425a-8c57-8d5b851acab8>","<urn:uuid:debc64bc-185b-4579-b3db-2cceb89792ef>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the mating habits of Golden-winged Warblers compared to American Woodcocks in terms of breeding locations and courtship?","answer":"Golden-winged Warblers and American Woodcocks have distinct mating habits. Golden-winged Warblers rely on young open forest with a mix of tall shrubs and saplings (3-13 feet high), interspersed with small areas of herbaceous cover, and intermittent overstory deciduous trees for breeding. They require habitat patches of at least 5 acres if within 1,000 feet of existing young forest habitat, or 25 acres if more distant. In contrast, American Woodcocks are polygynous and perform a unique courtship ritual called the 'sky dance' at dusk and dawn in breeding fields. Males spiral up high while flittering their wings and chirping, then circle back to ground making a peenting call. Males return to the same breeding fields yearly, and females select mates based on these displays, though they don't form lasting pair-bonds.","context":["New York State’s old fields, shrublands, and young forests are home to significant populations of some of the highest priority birds in the Atlantic Flyway. These birds depend on the habitats that grow back after natural and human-caused disturbances. Many of these species are in steep decline and at risk of disappearing from the New York landscape, but by working together, we can help their populations recover. Private and public landowners and land managers can restore young forest habitat, ensuring that these treasured birds are part of our ecosystem for future generations.\nGolden-winged Warblers and other young forest species like Willow Flycatcher, Brown Thrasher, Eastern Towhee, and Chestnut-sided Warbler rely on young open forest with shrubby areas for breeding success.\nBelow is some background and information on steps you can take if you own or manage land that has potentially high-quality habitat for bird species. Throughout the year, Audubon New York staff holds a series of habitat management workshops around the state. If you’re interested in learning more about the workshops or would like to talk with us about the potential of your land, please email us.\nHistorically, young forests and other early-successional habitats were created and maintained through natural disturbances such as fire, flooding, insect outbreaks, and beaver activity, as well as the actions of humans, like logging and farmland abandonment. Today, however, land use is very different than what it once was. Decades of suppression of these natural processes and changes in human land use have resulted in a landscape lacking in this critical habitat type, with serious implications for wildlife.\nYoung forest, also known as shrubland, is an early-successional habitat usually present due to a disturbance, and is typically defined as sites with persistent shrubs and/or seedling to sapling sized trees. With a temporary nature, young forest only lasts about 10-15 years before growing into more mature forest without any further disturbance. Historically, natural disturbances including fire damage, flooding, often as a result of beaver presence, and insect outbreaks have maintained this habitat. Forest management including clearcutting, and abandonment of farmland have also resulted in young forest habitat. In recent decades, many of these disturbance factors have been suppressed, resulting in a landscape of mostly mature forest in a similar age class. It is important now for land managers to mimic these historical disturbances by creating or maintaining young forests to benefit the birds that need it and to help diversify forest age classes across the landscape.\nGolden-winged Warbler Decline and Habitat Needs\nYoung forest habitat is important breeding habitat for several bird species as well as other wildlife, including Ruffed Grouse, American Woodcock, Eastern Towhee, Brown Thrasher, Field Sparrow, Willow Flycatcher, Prairie Warbler, New England cottontail, White-tailed Deer, and Red Fox. In Northern New York, Audubon New York is focused on managing young forest habitat for Golden-winged Warblers and associated young forest/shrubland species. A Species of Concern, Golden-winged Warblers have declined range-wide by 2.6% per year since 1966, and in New York, this species has declined by 5.3% per year from 1966 to 2011. This significant decline in population is driven largely by habitat loss as well as hybridization with the closely related Blue-winged Warbler. Golden-winged Warblers rely on young open forest with a mix of tall shrubs and saplings (3-13 feet high), interspersed with small areas of herbaceous cover (forbs and grasses), and intermittent overstory deciduous trees (>9 inches diameter breast height) for song perches. Each habitat patch should be at least 5 acres if it is within 1,000 feet of existing young forest habitat, or at least 25 acres if it is more than 1,000 feet from existing habitat. At a landscape scale, within 1.5 miles of young forest habitat, Golden-winged Warblers prefer >50% forest cover composed of at least 70% deciduous trees. Sites within a landscape matrix of agricultural fields (particularly row crops) and more than 1 mile away from other young forest patches are not ideal.\nCan cutting trees to make habitat give wildlife a boost? Yes, and this blog post by Joe Smith does a great job of explaining why.\nYoung forest habitat can range from abandoned farmland (old fields overgrown with shrubs) to hardwood swamps with scattered trees, to regenerating shoots and saplings after a clear-cut timber harvest. To achieve the structural diversity of vegetation described for Golden-winged Warbler habitat requirements (see above), managers can employ clear cuts, leaving enough perch trees scattered throughout the cut, they can clear an excess of shrub cover using brush hog mowers, or can even accelerate succession of old fields by planting native shrubs or tree seedlings.\nSome specific management techniques for “resetting” habitat succession to the young forest stage:\nTimber management: Use an even-aged forest management technique to create a ≥5 acre opening, retaining at least 5-15 trees per acre. The management target for canopy trees is basal area of 10-35 ft2/acre, or 10-30% canopy cover. Retained trees should be mostly deciduous or standing snags. If the patch is more than 1000 feet from existing young forest habitat, it should be at least 25 acres in size.\nFeathered edge: Thin trees to create irregular spacing and a gradual transition from open to closed canopy at the edge of a forest patch. The transition zone should be approximately 150 feet wide.\nSelective tree felling: In an old field setting, if more than 15 trees per acre exist, thin trees to reduce canopy cover to between 10-30% cover (basal area of 10-35 ft2/acre) and reach the 5-15 trees/acre target for Golden-winged Warbler habitat. Retain mast producing species when possible, including oak, hickory, hawthorn, or apple, and target conifers for removal first. Retain trees in aggregated clumps. Selectively felling trees will open the canopy to increase sunlight for herbaceous structure.\nMowing: If shrubs are uniformly distributed or contain few or no patches of herbaceous plants (forbs, grasses, and sedges), cut or mow shrubs into irregular clumps. Target invasive shrubs first when reducing shrub structure, such as honeysuckle, multiflora rose, and buckthorn. Mow site every 3-4 years around clumps of shrubs/saplings, to maintain patchy habitat structure.\nAdditional management techniques for “accelerating” old field habitat to the young forest stage:\nPlant desired species: If habitat structure contains too many forbs and grasses, plant fast growing, native deciduous shrubs and tree seedlings. If there are too many grasses and not enough forbs, reduce mowing to every 3-5 years, and plant appropriate native shrubs/saplings. Plantings should be done in clumps to create a patchy distribution at the management site. Ideal native shrubs for planting include: dogwoods, arrowwood, winterberry, serviceberry, and raspberry/blackberry.”\nRecommendations in this document are in part based on information available in the Golden-winged Warbler Status Review and Conservation Plan. Roth, A.M., Rohrbaugh, T. Will, and D.A. Buehler, editors. 2012. Golden-winged Warbler Status Review and Conservation Plan. www.gwwa.org/","American woodcocks are short, plump birds with very long bills (5.9 to 7.8 cm). Their feathers are mottled brown, rich buff and gray. These colors camouflage them in their woodland habitat. Woodcocks have large heads with three dark bands across the back. They have large brown eyes and rounded wings.\nMale and female American woodcocks look very similar, but females are bigger than males. Female American woodcocks range from 27 to 31 cm long and can weigh 151 to 279 g. Their wingspans range from 44.6 to 50.8 cm. Males range from 25 to 28 cm long and weigh 116 to 219 g. Their wingspans range from 40.4 to 45.5 cm (Keppie and Whiting, 1994; Terres, 1980).\nAmerican woodcocks occurs only in North America. They are distributed widely in the eastern United States and southeast Canada. Some individuals may winter in the Caribbean (Keppie and Whiting 1994).\nAmerican woodcocks live in forests that have open areas. A mixture of young forests and farm fields is ideal for woodcocks. Woodcocks move around between habitats for different activities and in different seasons. They sing in areas with woody vegetation, and they forage along forest edges. They nest many different habitats, including open fields, forests and old fields. In winter, they live in forests.\nAmerican woodcocks are polygynous. This means that each male may mate with many females. Males attract a mate by performing a courtship flight, called a “sky dance,” at dusk and dawn. They spiral up high, flittering their wings and chirping, and then circle quickly back to the ground, where they make a peenting call. The areas where males perform this display are called 'singing sites' or 'breeding fields', and males usually return to the same fields each year. Females chose which male to breed with after seeing the males’ “sky dances.” The male and female do not form a pair-bond, and the males do not help care for the eggs or chicks.\nThe female woodcock builds a simple nest on the ground. Sometimes she builds no nest at all and lays the eggs on leaf litter on the ground instead. She lays 1 to 5 (usually 4) grayish-orange eggs. She incubates them for 20 to 22 (usually 21) days. All of the eggs in a nest hatch within 4 to 5 hours, and the female broods the chicks until they are dry. The chicks and the mother all leave the nest together a few hours after the chicks hatch. The female broods and protects the chicks until they are 15 to 20 days old. She feeds them for the first week, but they are able to search for food when they are 3 to 4 days old. The chicks are nearly fully grown 28 days after hatching. They become independent from their mother when they are 31 to 38 days old. They are ready to mate when they are 10 to 12 months old. (Keppie and Whiting, 1994; Terres, 1980)\nMale woodcocks do not provide any parental care. Female woodcocks build the nest and incubate the eggs for approximately 21 days. They brood and protect the precocial chicks until they reach independence, and feed the chicks for the first week after hatching.\nThe maximum known lifespan of American woodcocks is 8 years.\nAmerican woodcocks are solitary birds. They are most active from at dusk and dawn, and sometimes on moonlit nights or cloudy days. American woodcocks also migrate at night. They may migrate alone, or in small flocks. During migration, you may see flocks in city parks, yards, orchards, or on lawns.\nStudies of American woodcocks have estimated home range sizes between 150,000 and 740,000 square meters.\nAmerican woodcocks use songs and physical displays to communicate. They make at least four different calls. These calls are called the Peent, Tuko, Chirping and Cackle. Males perform a beautiful display called a “song flight” or “sky dance”. They fly silently into the air in wide circles until they reach about 100 m high. Their wings make a twittering sound as they rise. They hover in the air, and then begin singing and chirping. They keep singing and chirping as they fall down to the ground like a leaf. This display is probably done to attract female mates.\nAmerican woodcocks eat during the day in spring and summer. In winter, they eat at night. They usually eat alone, but they don’t defend a territory. Woodcocks search for food by looking, or by feeling for the food or listening for it. They might stomp on the ground to disturb earthworms that are underground. If the earthworms move, woodcocks can find them by listening for them, or by feeling them with their bills.\nWoodcocks probably do not drink water. They get enough water in the foods that they eat.\nWoodcocks are very vulnerable to predators. Adults, chicks and eggs are all eaten by many different birds and mammals, including house cats. Eggs are also eaten by snakes.\nWoodcocks are cryptically colored. Their mottled brown, buff and gray feathers help them to blend in with the ground. This makes them harder for predators to see. If a predator comes near, female woodcocks may pretend to be injured to distract the predator from the eggs or chicks.\nAmerican woodcocks affect the earthworms and insect species that they eat. They may also aerate the soil while probing for insects and earthworms. They also provide habitat for at least 49 different types of body parasites.\nThere are no known adverse affects of American woodcocks on humans.\nAmerican woodcocks are a popular gamebird. An average of 2 million American woodcocks are shot each year by hunters.\nPopulations of American woodcocks seem to be getting smaller. Woodcocks die when they crash into cars, utility wires, lighthouses, TV towers, or other tall structures during migration. They are also sometimes killed by hunters, or in winter when there are long periods of cold or freezing weather and food is unavailable. Scientists are worried that American woodcocks are being poisoned by pesticides that are used near their habitat.\nAmerican woodcocks are protected under the U.S. Migratory Bird Act.\nAmerican woodcocks have several other interesting common names, including timberdoodle, Labrador twister, night partridge and bog sucker (Keppie and Whiting, Jr. 1994).\nKari Kirschbaum (author, editor), Animal Diversity Web.\nAlicia Ivory (author), University of Michigan-Ann Arbor.\nKeppie, D.M. and R.M.

{"question":"How do PTSD in veterans impact their reintegration into society, and what environmental threats do veterans face along with the general population?","answer":"Veterans with PTSD face significant challenges reintegrating into society, including physical wounds, isolation, heavy drinking, and depression that can risk their relationships, as shown in cases like Matthew Pennington who struggled after losing his leg during his third tour. The experience of returning home after life-changing experiences affects both veterans and civilians, as evidenced by a 9/11 survivor relating to these struggles. Like all humans, veterans also face broader environmental threats including pollution, climate change, and resource depletion. These environmental challenges include exposure to toxic chemicals in household items, harmful effects of carbon dioxide emissions, and health risks from raw sewage and air pollution.","context":["It’s All About Story\nWriter/director Nick Brennan’s latest film, A Marine’s Guide to Fishing, focuses on a Marine veteran struggling with both physical wounds and PTSD when he returns to his former life. “I was drawn to the story first and foremost by the realization that I couldn’t count a single close friend of mine that had served in Iraq or Afghanistan. It was a pretty sad realization given how long the wars had been going on.”\nBrennan also thought this wasn’t unusual for many civilians today. His insight led him to use his senior thesis film (he attended NYU’s Tisch program) to explore the stories of young veterans.\n“I was also interning with the investigative unit at ABC News at the time,” Brennan says, “and ended up covering a few big stories on Afghanistan, which gave me another insight into the war.” After a lot of time spent talking with vets, and with considerable research, Brennan zeroed in on the issues of PTSD and the process of reintegration into society.\nWriting the Script\nBrennan spent six months researching and writing the script. “Because I was a soft-handed film student with no real military experience,” he says, “I knew from the beginning of the process that for the film to really speak to something true, I needed to hear the stories of young veterans.” He worked mostly through the veteran communities at Columbia and NYU, where he interviewed two dozen student vets over the course of several months about their experiences since coming home.\nBrennan’s background and experience had been primarily in journalism. He says it was a no-brainer to just start reporting the story like he was writing a news article.\n“After listening to all these stories, I started drafting the film. It went through 14 different drafts (I was writing the script as part of a screenwriting class at NYU). Getting notes on the script back from class members and also the veterans I had met through researching, I ended up, by draft 14, settling on the script that more or less ended up on screen a year and a half later.”\nA Shared Experience\n“The sense of coming home after going through a life changing experience is something I think many of us can relate to,” Brennan says. “How do you come back to a place that has remained the same while you have changed so much?”\nBrennan believes this subject that isn’t just limited to veterans. This Marine’s story speaks also to the larger public. He says he recently received an email from a 9/11 survivor who said the story in A Marine’s Guide to Fishing very much reminded her of her own experience coping with her trauma after the 9/11 attacks. “This sort of shared experience is what I was really trying to capture.”\nAt the time Brennan began casting for his film, veteran Matthew Pennington was struggling with his own reintegration into civilian life. Pennington lost a leg during his third tour of duty in the Middle East. His life back home was marked with isolation, heavy drinking, and depression. His relationship with his wife was at risk.\nA friend sent him a casting notice. An undergraduate filmmaker was looking for someone to play a combat veteran who had lost a leg, had post-traumatic stress disorder and lived in Maine. Pennington, who has been profiled in a New York Times article, said “I thought acting would be so out of the normal that it would force me to deal with things. I wanted my life back.”\nWhen Brennan, also a Maine native, interviewed Pennington, he realized the similarities between the real soldier and his lead character, a Marine named Connor. “Both had worked in boat repair shops, both loved to fish, both struggled with life in small-town Maine.” Brennan cast Pennington for the role.\nOn set Brennan felt working with the professional SAG actors was a bigger challenge than working with Pennington. “With Matt,” he says, “it was about trust and honesty between the both of us, and creating an environment where he felt safe to expose himself and go to these dark places he’d kept bottled up inside.”\nA huge part of creating this environment was making sure the crew was on the same page about keeping the set a safe and fun place. “This tone was set first by me, the producer, the AD and the Cinematographer, and then continued all the way through to the production assistants.”\nOnce that environment was established, the set of about 25 people all became quite close, he says. That made Matt (and also the non-actor who was cast in the role of Matt’s Staff Sergeant) feel comfortable with the work they needed to do.\nDirecting the Staff Sergeant role became Brennan’s biggest challenge. A former Marine Corps drill sergeant initially cast to play the role had to pull out at the last minute. That left three days to cast someone in this critical role. “A neighbor of mine in Maine, Brett Cox, was a former LAPD cop who had trained with the Navy SEALS,” Brennan says, “and had been interested in helping out in some way with the film.\n“I brought a pack of beer over to his place and through the course of the night talked him into actually acting in the film. When it came time for his scene, we had only 30 minutes to rehearse this climactic moment between two non-actors, which is insane.\n“I talked to the film’s AD, Andrew Geller (a phenomenally talented AD and director – he was the superhero of the production) and said I needed to clear set and have time alone with the two actors. Andrew, to his credit, recognized the importance of the scene to the film and, despite the fact that we were about an hour behind at that point, gave me the time needed to get the actors ready.”\nBrennan says that, as a first-time fiction director, it was a huge challenge figuring out how to get the two non-actors to deliver a really difficult performance. “I ended up doing it by acting alongside Brett – in a way mirroring his level of excitement. This allowed him to feel comfortable.” Brennan says they kept the cameras rolling and didn’t have a set series of actions/cuts, allowing the moments to be fluid. This approach “… got Brett to the level where he could deliver the terrifying performance he gave. He did a hell of job capturing the scene and I think really made the film come together.”\nBrennan teamed with DP Matthew Troy, a recent NYU Film grad who also works professionally as a gaffer. “That was a big attraction to me because I wanted a no-nonsense, professional set.” Brennan says that Troy knew what he wanted and exactly how to get it. “I couldn’t imagine a more humble and on-point DP to have on set, especially given the sensitivity of the production.” Also a volunteer firefighter and EMS, Troy turned out to be a huge resource from a safety perspective (especially with the water scenes).\nTroy owned a Sony EX3 camera, to which they added a 35mm adaptor. “I wanted a filmic look to the image, capturing the grittiness of the docks and the warehouses, but I also wanted the flexibility to roll long, improvised takes with the non-actors without the time-pressure that shooting rolls of film creates.”\nWhen shooting was complete, Brennan initially worked with an assistant editor to go through the footage and get everything organized. He then moved back to Maine from New York for several months and edited the film himself. “I work professionally as a doc editor, so it was an exciting opportunity to cut my teeth on a narrative film.” Brennan says a solo edit is a very difficult process because you’re so close to the material that you miss having that second person in the room. As a result the film ends up weaker for it. “I don’t think I’ll ever be cutting my own films again.”\nBrennan and his producer, John Logan Pierson, used Kickstarter to raise the initial cash needed. “Kickstarter was great for a film like this,” he says, “where it’s a topical issue and the Kickstarter message spread out pretty far.” A third of the financing on Kickstarter ended up coming from people he’d never met before.\nHe also partnered with a Swiss-based production company called DecemberProd that came on board with additional funding. A grant from NYU and a fellowship from the Moving Picture Institute helped cover post-production expenses.\nWhile still in high school, Brennan spent a summer at a small film school in Prague, Czech Republic, called the PCFE Film School. “It offered me professional level experience making a short film. It was also a really awesome place to be when you’re 17.” This gave him a strong portfolio when applying to college film schools.\n“There’s really no one set path into Tisch,” Brennan says. He thinks most students that got into Tisch had done some sort of filmmaking program in high school. Many other students did NYU’s high school program or classes with NYFA.\n“More important than any specific film program (which can often be quite expensive), is to focus on telling stories and having a portfolio that highlights your ability to tell really interesting and effective stories.” He says that seems to be the big thing NYU is looking for in their recruitment. “You can be taught the technical skills, but the ability to tell a story is a special skill that can set you apart in the college process.”\nNYU isn’t the only game in town, says Brennan. Some of his favorite filmmakers to work with at Tisch were transfer students – people that started out at different schools and ended up transferring in after a year or two at another school. “I found that transfer students are some of the most focused and prepared students in the program. The transferring track, I think, can be a helpful avenue for aspiring young filmmakers that might not have the portfolio ready by the end of high school.”\nTrailer for A Marine’s Guide to Fishing.","Impact of Humans\nHumans pose a huge threat to lives of animals, plants and their environment\nOur impact is so great due to:\n- technologies that change the world so quickly\n- population increase\n- consumption of natural resources, and waste\nHuman Population Growth\nHumans can adapt to survive in almost all habitats and climates. The human population is increasing rapidly and is threatening the environment.\nThe population will eventually be limited by these factors:\n- food and water supply\n- disease and pollution\n- sudden changes in climate\nHousehold Waste, Sewage and Pollutants\nPollution is the addition of substances to the environment that may be harmful to living organisms. The increase in the human population is also increasing the amount of pollution.\nMost rubbish is buried in landfill sites and not all of it comprises safe materials. Even common household items can contain toxic chemicals such as poisonous metals. Many smoke alarms contain radioactive americium, for example.\nRaw sewage is harmful to the environment. It kills aquatic organisms and harms human health. Sewage must be treated to make it safer before it can be released into the environment.\nCarbon dioxide is released when fossil fuels are used. It is a greenhouse gas that can prevent heat escaping from the Earth into space. Increased emissions of carbon dioxide are causing a rise in carbon dioxide levels, which in turn contribute to global warming. People have different ‘carbon footprints’, depending on how much carbon dioxide their activities produce.\nMany fuels contain small amounts of sulphur compounds. When these fuels are burned sulphur dioxide is released into the air. Sulphur dioxide causes acid rain that can damage buildings, and kill plants and aquatic animals.\nIn the past, chlorofluorocarbons or CFCs were widely used in aerosol cans, refrigerators and insulating materials. CFCs destroy ozone in the upper atmosphere, leading to ozone depletion. This causes increased levels of ultraviolet light to reach the Earth’s surface.\nUrbanisation & Industrialisation\nMore and more people are moving into the cities.\n- increased pollution due to traffic, energy consumption and waste production\n- farmland is built on, land taken out of food production\n- loss of natural habitats, as cities and roads are built\n- rural communities and cultures dissolve as people leave to live in urban areas\nDevelopment of industries\n- non-renewable fossil fuels are used for energy\n- release of greenhouse gases speeds up global warming\nThe most common source of air pollution is the combustion of fossil fuels. This usually happens in vehicle engines and power stations. Sulfur dioxide is released if the fuel contains sulfur compounds. This gas contributes to acid rain. Lichens can be used as air pollution indicators, especially of the concentration of sulfur dioxide in the atmosphere.\nLichens are plants that grow in exposed places such as rocks or tree bark. They need to be very good at absorbing water and nutrients to grow there. Rainwater contains just enough nutrients to keep them alive. Air pollutants dissolved in rainwater, especially sulfur dioxide, can damage lichens and prevent them from growing. This makes lichens natural indicators of air pollution.\n- bushy lichens need really clean air\n- leafy lichens can survive a small amount of air pollution\n- crusty lichens can survive in more polluted air.\nIn places where no lichens are growing it is often a sign that the air is heavily polluted with sulfur dioxide.\nWater pollution is caused by the discharge of harmful substances into rivers, lakes and seas. Many aquatic invertebrate animals cannot survive in polluted water, so their presence or absence indicates the extent to which a body of water is polluted.\nEffect of Fertilisers\nIntensive farming can damage the environment.\n1. Fertilisers containing plant nutrients are sprayed onto fields\n2. Plants grow faster and boost crop yields.\n3. Rain means may wash nutrients from the fields and into rivers and lakes (this is called run-off).\n4.

{"question":"How do tidal ranges compare between Mediterranean salt marshes and the Bay of Fundy in terms of their magnitude?","answer":"Mediterranean salt marshes experience minimal tidal differences and are considered micro-tidal (less than 2m tidal range), while the Bay of Fundy has the world's largest tidal range reaching up to 16.3m (53 feet). This extreme difference is due to the Bay of Fundy's unique geography, where the bay's narrowing shape from mouth to inner shores creates a funneling effect, causing over 115 billion tonnes of water to flow in and out daily.","context":["Spatial and temporal variability of salt marshes\nA salt marsh (Figure 1) is a tidal wetland in the upper coastal intertidal zone between salty or brackish water. They replace mangroves in temperate and arctic regions. Their flora is dominated by halophytic (salt-tolerant) vegetation (Adam, 1990 ), such as grasses, shrubs and herbs . The sediment consists of mud and sand. Salt marshes are normally associated with mud flats, these mud flats are sometimes dominated by algae. However, salt marshes can also occur on sand flats.\nSalt marshes are regularly subjected to tidal movement and wave action. Tidal channels control the drainage of this seawater and allow detritus, dissolved nutrients, plankton and small fishes to be flushed in and out the salt marshes. Salt marshes protect the lowlands from marine flooding by damping storm and waves and by slowing flows pushing inland (Allen, 2000).\nThe total number and area of salt marshes have been declining for many years. The main cause is enclosure, which removes the habitat from tidal inundation. Another problem, especially across Europe, is lateral erosion which leads to a loss of salt-marsh habitat. (More info)\nEuropean-scale distribution of salt marshes\nSpecies composition and zonation of marsh vegetation\nSpecies compositions of vegetation communities are governed by species’ ability to compete and their tolerance to site‐specific environmental conditions and physical disturbance (Grime 1979 ). Most classification schemes recognize five vegetation zones in salt‐marshes along the vertical gradient in seawater exposure (inundation frequency) (Figure 2). To some degree, this vertical zonation reflects a general decline from the low to high elevations in the tolerance of species to seawater flooding (Allen 2000). Thus, the grazing-marsh above the intertidal zone has less predominance of salinity‐tolerant species than the salt marsh. However, the predictable vertical alignment of species along the salinity gradient is strongly modified by the species’ competitive abilities, as well as their tolerances to site‐specific conditions, including tidal range and climate (e.g. rainfall), as well as salinity, nutrient and disturbance (e.g. waves or grazing) regimes (Allen 2000; Bertness et al., 2002 ). For instance, intense grazing disturbance may cause less competitively strong mid‐marsh species to become more common in the high marsh (Kiehl et al. 1996 ). Traits for competition, environmental and disturbance tolerance often exist in trade-off. Thus, while competitive fitness generally increases up‐shore, some low marsh species compensate for lack of competitive ability by being more tolerant to wave disturbance than high shore species (Pennings and Calloway 1992 ).\nEuropean salt‐marsh distribution and vegetation composition\nAlthough salt‐marshes are not the most diverse ecosystems, due to the influence of the salinity regime, they are highly productive. Along the European coasts salt‐marsh vegetation composition differs between four regions (Figure 3) from which a large area is protected within Natura 2000: 1) North Atlantic; 2) South Atlantic; 3) Mediterranean; 4) Baltic and Boreal regions (European Commission, 2007). A short description of these regional vegetation differences in vegetation composition is given in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3. In general the salt marshes in North-West Europe can be considered to belong to the North Atlantic. In contrast to the other types, these marshes are mostly exposed to large tidal amplitudes. In general the salt marshes and meadows along the Baltic Sea experience minimal tidal differences, and can be considered micro-tidal. Most of the Baltic and boreal coastal areas were traditionally used for mowing or grazing, thus enlarging the areas and keeping the vegetation low, rich in vascular plants, characteristically the vegetation occurs in distinct zones, with saline vegetation closest to the sea. The Mediterranean and South Atlantic coastal areas consist largely of the same species composition. This is due to the temperature, although Mediterranean species higher up on the shore are usually more dessication resistant. In general the salt marshes and meadows along the Mediterranean experience minimal tidal differences, and can be considered micro‐tidal.\n|Glasswort swards (Thero-Salicornietalia): annual glasswort (Salicornia spp., Microcnemum coralloides), seablite (Suaeda maritima), or sometimes saltwort (Salsola spp.) formations colonizing periodically inundated muds of coastal salt marshes and inland salt‐basins.|\n|Mediterranean halo-nitrophilous pioneer communities (Frankenion pulverulentae): formations of halo‐nitrophilous annuals (Frankenia pulverulenta, Suaeda splendens, Salsola soda, Cressa cretica, Parapholis incurva, P. strigosa, Hordeum marinum, Sphenopus divaricatus) colonizing salt muds of the Mediterranean region, susceptible to temporary inundation and extreme drying.|\n|Atlantic sea‐pearlwort communities (Saginion maritimae): formations of annual pioneers occupying sands subject to variable salinity and humidity, on the coasts, in dune systems and salt marshes.

Due to the interaction of hydrodynamic forces and vegetation‐sedimentation feedbacks, complex patterns of marsh establishment, development and destruction can occur at the same time spread across the marsh. Moreover, salt-marshes can go through cycles of large-scale marsh build-up alternated with lateral erosion resulting in a spatial shift of the leading vegetation edge and eroding cliff in time. Consequently, it will be a challenge to separate development trends in salt-marsh extant caused by environmental changes, by e.g. climate change and sea level rise, from changes due to the natural variability of this ecosystem.\nCase study 1: Salt marshes along the Western Scheldt, Netherlands\nRecently the spatiotemporal variability of eight salt marshes along the Scheldt estuary have been investigated (Figure 4, van der Wal., et al 2008 ). The study revealed the significance of intrinsic processes in salt marsh development, and the necessity to consider the local feedback mechanisms between plant growth, morphology and hydrodynamics of both the salt marsh and the mudflat, when assessing the status of salt marshes. Furthermore, the importance of assessing salt marsh changes in a spatial context is highlighted, rather than looking at changes in total salt marsh area. Most salt marshes showed simultaneous expansion of Spartina anglica tussocks, and lateral retreat of the mature salt marsh plateau, resulting in salt marsh rejuvenation, which support these conclusions. However, based on this study no clear relationship could be found between the net expansion or erosion and the hydrodynamic conditions at the edge of the salt marsh. Hence, additional mechanistic insight is required to determine which and how hydrodynamic and sedimentary conditions are important for the development and erosion of salt marshes.\nCase study 2: Salt marshes along the Yangtze Esturary, China\nThe Yangtze Estuary is a typical medium tidal estuary with multi-order bifurcations, shoals and sand bars. The enormous quantities of sediment produced by the Yangtze River have created extensive areas of shoals and tidal flats in the estuarine region, which have been colonized by various types of salt-marsh vegetation. According to a recent study based on remote sensing mapping (Huang et al., 2008 ), the salt marsh vegetation in the Shanghai region amounted to 18314.8 ha (Year 2008) and more than 95% of salt marsh vegetation belonged to the four major plant communities, i.e. the reed (Phragmites australis) community, the smooth cord-grass (Spartina alterniflora, an exotic species) community, and two types of sedge (Scirpus mariqueter and Carex scabriflora) communities.\nThe tidal flats closest to the low water mark, elevation less than 2 m, are characterized by mud flats that are devoid of any vascular plants. As sedimentation and succession progressed, the Phragmites australis community replaced the Scirpus mariqueter community above the 2.9 m elevation. An additional species in this zone was Spartina alterniflora, which was introduced to the Yangtze Estuary in 1990s. Over the last two decades this species has gradually invaded large areas which were previously covered by P. australis and has also started to invade the upper parts of the S. mariqueter zone (Figure 5). This expansion of S. alterniflora, is a prime example of a spatially‐structured invasion in a relatively simple habitat, for which strategic control efforts can be modeled and applied.\n- Salt marshes\n- Dynamics, threats and management of salt marshes\n- Natural barriers, salt marshes\n- Biogeomorphology of coastal systems\n- Restoration of salt marshes and mudflats\n- Adam P., 1990.

A tidal range is the difference in the height of a high tide and its corresponding low tide. Tidal ranges are not fixed but vary depending on the location of the sun and the moon. Additionally, the greatest tidal ranges tend to occur during spring tides, when the gravitational forces of the sun and the moon are in alignment. Tidal ranges are also large during the first and last stages of a moon phase. During a new moon, the gravitational forces of the moon and the sun reinforce one another, while the two forces are opposed during a full moon. While coastal regions will receive higher than normal tidal ranges during these times, the highest tidal ranges are experienced when a spring tide coincides with the equinox.\nTidal Range Classifications\nThe average tidal range in an open ocean is approximately 0.6 m, with a global range between zero and 12 m. A tidal range typically becomes larger closer to a coast. Other factors that can determine a tidal range include the amount of water near the coast, as well the size and shape of the water basin. Tidal ranges are often greater in larger bodies of water, and the geography of a water basin can either funnel or disperse a tide, increasing and decreasing the tidal range, respectively.\nOne common misconception about the factors affecting tidal ranges is that they increase as one moves north from the equator. This erroneous theory stems from the fact that most areas with high tidal ranges are located in areas north of the equator.\nTidal ranges are typically grouped into three categories. Tidal ranges less than 2 m are classified as micromareal, those between 2 m and 4 m are classified as mesomareal, and tidal ranges greater than 4 m are classified as macromareal.\nThe World’s Largest Tidal Range\nThe world's largest tidal range is observed at Canada's Bay of Fundy, which can reach 16.3 m (53 feet). The Bay of Fundy is an example of how geography can increase a tidal range by funneling. The bay sits between the two Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, and the bay becomes narrower from the mouth of the bay to the inner shores. The tide at the Bay of Fundy is semidiurnal, meaning that there are two high tides and two low tides each day, spaced about 6 hours and 13 minutes apart. The difference between low tide and high tide can reach an astonishing 16.3 m with over 115 billion tonnes of water flowing in and out of the bay. The highest recorded tidal range was in 1869 where the water level rose 21.6 m (71 ft) during the Saxby Gale.\nLarge tidal ranges also occur in the United Kingdom, reaching up to 15 m at the Severn Estuary, which is between England and Wales. Parts of the United States that receive high tidal ranges of up to 12 m feet include Anchorage, Alaska."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:be54dbc3-ced6-431e-a8c7-4c20d93ce343>","<urn:uuid:b9fb11ca-0c78-4518-9dd3-1ae3a13fb892>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What steps should I take to clean the viewfinder of a Canon AE-1 when it appears dirty?","answer":"To clean a dirty viewfinder on a Canon AE-1, you have two options: 1) The simplest solution is to remove the SLR lens to expose the inner mirror and lens, then use pressurized air to clean them. This method removes dust and dirt without risking scratches. 2) If the inner mirror and/or lens are scratched or cracked, they will need to be replaced entirely.","context":["Canon AE-1 Troubleshooting\n- Battery Needle Will Not Move\n- Shutter Will Not Function Properly\n- Cleaning Inner Mirror and Lens\n- Light Exposure on Film\n- Nothing Worked\nThe Canon AE-1 is a 35mm single-lens reflex film camera. Canon released the AE-1 in 1976. The Canon AE-1 uses a electromagnetic focal plane shutter with a speed from 1/1000 to 2 seconds.\nBattery Needle Will Not Move ¶\n\"The camera has no power.''\nBattery is Not in Correctly ¶\nThe Canon Ae-1 runs on a single 4LR44 or PX-28 battery. It is possible that the battery was put in incorrectly. Open the battery hatch on the front of the camera. Check to see that the positive and negative nodes on the battery align correctly and that the battery is in all the way.\nBattery is Dead ¶\nIt may be that the battery is dead. This can be check using a voltage meter to check the battery's charge or by simple replacing the battery with a fresh one.\nCorroded Terminals ¶\nIt is possible with the age of the Canon Ae-1 that the terminals for the battery have been corroded. If this is the case try to remove some of the rust off of the terminals. A good way to remove the rust is to soak just the terminals in coke.\nShutter Will Not Function Properly ¶\n\"Shutter does not cycle correctly with the film.\"\nReplace the Battery ¶\nOne of the main reasons that this happens is that the battery in the camera is almost dead. The function that cycles the film take a significantly less amount of power, then it does to make the shutter function. Simple replace the battery.\nClean the Electromagnet ¶\nThe shutter in the Canon Ae-1 funtions with an electromagnet. As the camera gets older the camera can accumulate metal particles on the electromagnet. These particles will cause the electromagnet to not have enough power to function the shutter. To fix this you will need to remove the bottom and spray pressurized air into the small plastic container that houses the electromagnet.\nCleaning Inner Mirror and Lens ¶\n\"Looking through the view finder the lens appears dirty''\nClean with Pressurized Air ¶\nThe simplest way to fix this problem is to remove the SLR lense. This will expose the inner mirror and lens. Take a canister of pressurized air and spray it on the mirror and lense. This will remove dust and dirty without the risk of scratching either the lens or mirror.\nReplace the Mirror and/or Lens ¶\nIt is possilbe the the inner mirror and/or the lens have been scratched or cracked. If this is the case they will need to be replaced.\nLight Exposure on Film ¶\n\"There is light exposure on the pictures after they have been developed.\"\nRewind Film Fully ¶\nThis may be because the film was not completely rewind before being taken out of the camera. Be sure to rewind the fill fully before opening the film compartment.\nCheck Foam Seals ¶\nThere is a foam light seal inside the film compartment that can go bad. This is often the case with light exposure problems becasue the Canon Ae-1 is over 20 years old. Replace the strip of foam with a new piece and the problem should be fixed.\nNothing Worked ¶\nThe solutions above didn't work or you have a different problem not listed.\nThe full user manual can be found for free at http://www.butkus.org/chinon/canon/canon..."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d64cee6f-724d-431d-b89b-a8d74a5e6829>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the creative aspects of fashion photography, and what sustainable practices are transforming the industry?","answer":"Fashion photography is a complex creative genre that goes beyond simple portraiture, requiring careful concept development and storytelling to sell fashion items like clothes, accessories, and cosmetics. Photographers must build concepts that serve a commercial purpose while allowing for artistic expression. Meanwhile, the fashion industry is being transformed by sustainable practices that emphasize both ecological and social justice benefits. These include using natural and renewable materials like organic cotton and bamboo, implementing fair trade practices that ensure workers receive living wages, and creating transparent production processes. This shift towards sustainability allows consumers to purchase stylish, trendy clothing while supporting environmental protection and ethical manufacturing.","context":["Fashion photography’s origin is closely linked to art, especially in those cases in which editorial names like Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar, Vanity Fair, and more. Nowadays, it has evolved into a complex genre that scopes from sophisticated concepts published by fashion magazines to casual lifestyle imagery posted in a consistent way by highly skilled individuals.\nWhat makes fashion in fashion photography is the unquestionable relationship it has to any of the outcomes from the fashion industry; clothes, shoes, accessories, cosmetics, and hair, all construct the iconic spirit of fashion. From models to backgrounds, they all make the necessary means for these products to tell the story in a moving and fashionable way.\nHere, we’ll be sharing the seven essential tips and techniques needed for starting out today in the magnificent world of fashion photography!\n1. It Ain’t Portraiture\nPerhaps one of the biggest mistakes in which fashion photography newcomers tend to fall is the general confusion this genre keeps with portraiture. It is true that fashion photography can benefit from using portraits, but it is a broader universe in that sense. It can contain portraiture, but it surely doesn’t limit to making just fashionable portraits, whatever that might be.\nThis is important for you to understand because it will open up the creative possibilities that the portraiture mindset could be possibly restraining on your side. For example, portrait photographers tend to love shooting with 85mm lenses, but does that necessarily mean you could only shoot with that focal length as a fashion photographer? Of course not!\n2. Build a Concept\nOr at least have a story to tell. It is no secret that there are tons of talented photographers out there doing pretty much anything within the doable scope. But, there’s still room for rising talent in this highly crowded place; and that’s achieved with the aid of concept construction. Unfortunately for this, there isn’t an exact recipe. Hence the “at least have a story to tell” advice. Building a concept is just a fancy way of saying that in visual communication efforts, our creations should have a purpose; and that is the concept behind a photograph. But one thing is certain about concepts in fashion photography, they all are directed to selling something, and that something is any of the five aforementioned inanimate objects in which the fashion industry revolves. Selling any of those should be your conceptual baseline, and how to sell them will rely entirely on your creativity.\n3. Plan Ahead\nConcepts aren’t out there in the wild waiting for us to cherry-pick them out, they have to be built with the aid of logic and imagination. And that requires sitting down and making some plans. Fashion photography is the way in which the fashion industry speaks to us in seductive ways, and for those images to become real, a lot of people must be added to the equation.\nMake-up artists, locations, wardrobes, models, catering, and lighting assistants are some of the few common roles that get involved in moderately decent fashion photography projects. And in order to succeed in an endeavor like this one, zero improvisation should be allowed. Well, some improv wouldn’t hurt the images, but please don’t rely on having any plan at all. As in any other branch of commercial photography, preparation is fundamental for fashion-related projects as well.\n4. Keep Lighting Simple\nEven when solely relying on naturally available light, keeping things simple will guarantee you delicate and elegant results. Also, rich tonalities are better achieved when using soft lighting sources. But if you are planning on using some artificial lights as well, then keeping things simple will make your shooting more pleasant for sure. Light is the raw material with which any photograph is crafted, and having too much of it too little could ruin the whole thing; especially when there’s a concept that must be achieved in communicational terms. Understanding how light works as something that gets transformed throughout the photographic workflow will keep you safe from breaking your bank account. One good light source and a simple reflector could be enough to fill a properly lit scene with already available light. Some filmmakers rely on practical lighting, which is using distinct artificial light sources like candles, light bulbs, monitor screens, car lights, Christmas lights, etc. All in order to fill the gaps left behind from available light in a natural and realistic way.\nFor several photographers, this might sound familiar. A really common mistake newcomers tend to make is trying to create very complicated lighting schemes with flashes and strobes everywhere. History has told us that this only makes things worse, and takes the joy out of the craft. Be smart, learn from our mistakes, pick a location, see & feel what you have to work with, and only then think about how to light it in a useful way.\n5. Find One Lens\nThis one goes against many suggestions, the same which are suspiciously sponsored by camera brands telling us to explore different optics and focal lengths options. But the truth is quite simple and doesn’t require that many gears. If you are just starting out, it will be very likely that the number 18-55mm feels somewhat familiar to you. This focal range corresponds to the usual cheap lens bundled with entry-level DSLR and mirrorless cameras, and it does have a purpose beyond knowing if your brand new camera works properly.\nThe kit lens is the humble introduction to the fantastic world of interchangeable lens capabilities. If you find yourself comfortable shooting with numbers between 18 and 28mm, then you should probably invest in a wide-angle lens that will allow you to continue capturing your fashion-oriented shots with that storytelling wide perspective. Certain companies have developed such capable wide-angle lenses, that they deliver virtually no barrel distortion when shooting with them. Also, they are built with high-quality components and come with fast apertures for shooting in subtle and low-light situations.\nIf you find yourself comfortable with a bit of walking while still retaining some amount of wideness and that normal perspective feel, then a 35mm lens will be your next best friend. And if you are more into the portraiture approach with your fashion images, then a 50mm could do the trick for you. And also this optic is considered to be “normal” as it corresponds to normal human sign capabilities when mounted in a full-frame camera.\nLast but not least, longer lenses or telephotos tend to deliver a really nice perspective when it comes to portraits; therefore anything from 85mm to 200 will be good for you. Just take into account that long lenses are harder to use when shooting hand-held. One thing that you need to remember is this, in fashion, you are trying to sell something, it might have room for artistic expressions, but in the end, it will still be commercial imagery, therefore try to look for a lens that will guarantee you that products will look as stunning as your clients expect them to be.\n6. Stick to that Lens\nThis is one of the most important photographic pieces of advice you’ll ever receive. After finding that new lens that makes you feel at ease with your photographs, stop worrying about another one. Stick to it for at least one or two years, get to know that lens like your best friend, learn its behavior under any light circumstance, get to know how to anticipate frames with it, get to know which are the scenes or conditions the lens won’t make it with. And after that, you’ll be able to respond to light with your lens as if it is an embedded part of your body.\n7. Take the Concept to Post-Processing\nAnother big mistake many photographers make is that they forget that a concept or purpose should be by the photographs side at every moment, even during the publishing stage. Therefore, when starting to develop your raw files, ask yourself, what should the developing decisions be made? Starting from white-balance to even lens corrections, everything has to go in line with the purpose of your photographs. It is no surprise that the White-Balance sliders are the very first thing one encounters in several raw image development software. It is the most crucial decision regarding the message that an image is willing to convey. A warm temperature will result in a soothing vibe, and a cold temperature could result in a nostalgic feel. Any emotion can be enhanced with this decision, and all of the following adjustments should correspond to the message that you are trying to convey.\nWrapping it Up\nNo matter the style that as a fashion photographer you might end up developing, there’s one thing that you should never forget, fashion photography serves a specific purpose, and that is to sell fashion-related items. It might be open to wildly creative and even artistic images but in the end, they have to influence people into making some buying decisions that will benefit the brand behind the shot.\nLara Zankoul – Editorial Fashion Photography","What is Sustainable Fashion?\nIn recent years, there has been an increase in consumer awareness and demand for more sustainable fashion. Sustainable fashion emphasizes not only ecological benefits, but also social justice. It’s so much more than just using eco-friendly materials; it’s about creating a fairer and more ethical production system.\nSo, what is sustainable fashion and why should you care? In this article, we will explore the topics of what sustainable fashion is, the benefits, challenges and how to shop sustainably. We will also discuss the future of sustainable fashion and, finally, draw a conclusion.\nThe Benefits of Sustainable Fashion\nThe term “sustainable fashion” has become an increasingly important one in the fashion industry. It is a phrase that encompasses a wide range of topics, from the materials used to create clothing to the supply chain practices used to get that clothing to you. Sustainable fashion is all about promoting a healthier environment and creating a better future for all.\nOne of the biggest benefits of sustainable fashion is its environmental friendliness. Instead of using synthetic materials and generating waste, sustainable fashion is focused on using materials that are natural and renewable, such as organic cotton and bamboo.\nNot only are these materials better for the environment, but they also help to create clothes that are more breathable and softer on the skin. Sustainable fashion is also committed to reducing the carbon footprint of fashion. This can be accomplished by reducing energy consumption, decreasing water usage, and reducing the use of chemicals.\nSustainable fashion is also an ethical way to shop for clothing. Sustainable fashion companies often use fair trade practices, meaning that the people making the clothing are paid a living wage and work in safe and humane conditions.\nSustainable fashion companies are also often more transparent, allowing customers to see where their clothes are sourced from and the production processes used.\nFinally, sustainable fashion is a great way to shop for trendy and stylish clothing. It is no longer necessary to choose between looking great and being kind to the environment. Sustainable fashion companies are dedicated to creating high-quality pieces that are fashionable and stylish.\nIn summary, sustainable fashion is an incredibly important movement in the fashion industry. It provides environmental protection and ethical practices in the production of clothing. It also gives customers the opportunity to purchase stylish and trendy clothing without sacrificing quality or ethics.\nSustainable fashion is the future of eco-friendly clothing, and it has the potential to make a huge impact on the fashion industry.\nThe Challenges of Sustainable Fashion\nOne of the toughest challenges of Sustainable Fashion is the cost. Sustainable fashion typically relies on more natural materials and processes, which can be significantly more expensive than traditional fashion materials.\nSimilarly, sustainable fashion products also take much longer to produce, as they require more complex and labor intensive manufacturing processes. This can lead to higher price tags, which can be difficult for consumers to purchase.\nAnother of the challenges of Sustainable Fashion is the conflicting desires of consumers. Many consumers want to purchase clothing that is eco-friendly and sustainable, but they also want fashion that is trendy and fashionable. It can be difficult for companies to balance both of these desires and to create pieces that are both fashionable and sustainable.\nFinally, a lack of knowledge and awareness is a major challenge for Sustainable Fashion. Consumers often don’t understand the meaning and implications of eco-friendly and sustainable fashion, which can make it difficult for companies to promote and spread the message.\nSimilarly, many fashion designers are still unfamiliar with the materials and techniques used in sustainable fashion, meaning that there is not yet a large body of experts who are able to design sustainable fashion pieces.\nThese challenges demonstrate the difficulty of Sustainable Fashion, particularly from a consumer perspective. Companies need to work to increase awareness, reduce costs, and create trendy designs that will appeal to consumers who are looking for eco-friendly ways to dress. If successful, Sustainable Fashion can become a mainstream and widely accepted form of fashion.\nHow to Shop Sustainably\nAs the fashion industry looks towards the future, they are increasingly turning to sustainable practices and eco-friendly clothing. Shopping sustainably means reducing your ecological footprint by buying clothes that are made with sustainable materials and/or produced in an ethical way. Here are some tips on how to do just that.\n- Do Your Research\nIt’s important to take the time to do your research on a company before you make a purchase. Read company websites, find out about their production processes and materials used in their clothes, and even contact them directly with questions. Read up on their sustainability credentials and make sure you are happy with what you’re buying.\n- Look for Sustainable Materials\nSustainable materials are those that are either renewable or biodegradable, and don’t damage the environment. Popular sustainable fabrics include bamboo, hemp, linen, and organic cotton. Look for clothes that are made from sustainable materials and be sure to check the label.\n- Shop Local\nShopping local is an excellent way to ensure the clothes you buy are produced in an ethical way, as it is easier to monitor how the clothes are made and who is making them. Shopping at local independent stores can also help to support your local community.\n- Choose Quality Over Quantity\nRather than buying a lot of cheap, fast fashion clothes, opt for quality over quantity and invest in clothes that will last longer. Buying higher quality clothing means you can wear it for longer, so you’re not buying new clothes as often.\n- Choose Secondhand\nShopping secondhand is a great way to reduce the impact of your wardrobe on the environment. As well as being a more affordable and sustainable option, secondhand clothes can be fun to shop for and have their own story.\nBy following these tips, you can make sure you’re shopping sustainably and responsibly for fashion and clothing. Sustainability is an important partof the future of the fashion industry and it’s up to us to make sure we are taking the steps to ensure it is a responsible one.\nLook For Sustainable Materials\nWhen shopping for eco-friendly clothing, it’s important to consider the materials that make up the item. It’s better to choose items from companies that use materials that are either sustainably sourced or eco-friendly.\nSustainable materials include materials made from renewable sources, such as bamboo or organic cotton. These materials are produced in ways that reduce waste and conserve natural resources.\nAdditionally, many of these materials are produced in an ethical manner, providing better working conditions and wages for workers.\nSynthetic materials are often used in fashion, but many of these materials are not sustainable. Therefore, it is better to select items made from natural fibers, like wool, hemp, and silk, as these materials are more environmentally friendly and biodegradable.\nAdditionally, choosing organic materials like cotton and bamboo is a great way to support sustainable fashion.\nWhen shopping for eco-friendly clothing, it is important to look at the labels. Clothes that are labeled as “eco-friendly” or “all natural” may be made with sustainable materials and are therefore better for the environment.\nHowever, it is important to read labels carefully to ensure that the materials used meet the standards of sustainability. Additionally, looking for certifications such as Fair Trade or Oeko-Tex can also be a good indication of an item’s sustainability.\nFinally, attempting to purchase items made close to home can help to reduce energy costs associated with manufacturing and transportation. By taking the time to look for sustainable materials in clothing, individuals can be part of the shift towards more sustainable fashion.\nBuy from Sustainable Brands\nThe best way to ensure that your fashion choices are eco-friendly is to buy from sustainable brands. Sustainable fashion brands are those that use eco-friendly materials and production techniques, focus on ethical labor practices, and promote sustainability as a core part of their mission.\nShopping from these brands allows you to support eco-friendly brands while also reducing your environmental impact.\nWhen shopping for sustainable fashion clothing, look for labels with organic cotton, bamboo, hemp, or other natural materials. These natural fabrics are easier on the environment than synthetic materials like polyester and nylon.\nMany sustainable brands also use eco-friendly dyes and other production techniques that have a low environmental impact.\nSustainable fashion brands also focus on ethical labor practices. Many sustainable fashion brands prioritize fair wages, safe working conditions, and the use of locally sourced materials and labor. This ensures that workers in the fashion industry are paid fairly for their work and have safe working conditions.\nFinally, many sustainable fashion brands focus on giving back to their communities and supporting projects that help to protect the environment. For example, many sustainable fashion brands donate a portion of their profits to environmental charities. This allows consumers to feel good about their purchases, knowing that they are supporting an eco-friendly brand that is also helping to make the world a better place.\nOverall, shopping from sustainable fashion brands is the best way to ensure that your fashion choices are eco-friendly. By buying from these brands, you can feel good about your purchase and know that you are helping to protect the environment.\nLook for Disclosure Information\nWhen shopping for eco-friendly clothing, look for disclosure information from the company and preferably an independent third-party certifier to ensure the clothing’s validity as a sustainable product.\nEvery company has a different set of sustainable standards they must meet, such as water and energy conservation, material sourcing, chemical and waste management, and corporate social responsibility.\nMany companies include these standards on their website, and some even have them printed on their clothing and packaging for customer reference.\nHaving a third-party certifier adds additional assurance of the sustainability of the fashion brand’s products. Organizations such as the Global Organic Textile Standard, Fairtrade Certified, and Cotton LEADS certification programs all certify various eco-friendly clothing and fashion items and can provide customers with a guarantee of the product’s sustainability.\nThe certification process varies by organization, but generally requires that companies undergo a comprehensive assessment of their product’s materials and production processes in order to qualify for the certification. This assessment process is also necessary for a company to be able to legally advertise their products as eco-friendly and sustainable.\nTo further support sustainable fashion, it is important to remember to research and read labels when shopping for eco-friendly clothing. This will help to ensure that the clothing you buy is of the highest quality and is produced ethically and in an environmentally responsible way. Learning to recognize quality and sustainability practices when shopping can help to create a brighter future for the fashion industry.\nBe Mindful of Trends\nAs fashion trends come and go, it is important to be mindful of what is considered “in-vogue” at any given time. This is particularly true when it comes to sustainable fashion. While it is important to remain up to date on the latest fashion trends, there are ways to do so while still remaining conscious of the environment.\nTo start, it is wise to look for eco-friendly fashion trends made from natural materials. Natural materials, such as organic cotton, do not require the use of harsh chemicals or toxins and is a much more sustainable option.\nAdditionally, when shopping for fashion trends, it can be helpful to look for pieces that are locally made. This reduces the emissions generated from shipping, as well as supports the local economy.\nFurthermore, investing in quality pieces that can be worn for years to come is a great way to stay on trend without having to replace items as often.\nFinally, as a way to further embrace sustainable fashion, one can look towards second-hand pieces. Buying pre-owned clothing that is still in good condition is a great way to add variety to one’s wardrobe in a sustainable way. Not only does this reduce the need for new clothes, but it also leaves a much smaller environmental footprint.\nIn sum, fashion trends are constantly changing and it is important to remain up-to-date on the latest styles. While doing so, it is important to remain mindful of the environment by opting for sustainable fashion trends, such as organic cotton and locally made pieces. Furthermore, second-hand items can be a great way to add variety and to help minimize one’s environmental impact.\nThe Future of Sustainable Fashion\nWhen it comes to fashion and clothing, sustainability is the way of the future. In the era of global warming and increasing awareness of environmentally conscious practices, eco-friendly clothing is the best way to reduce our ecological footprint.\nAs the global population continues to grow, sustainability is becoming an increasingly important issue, and sustainable fashion is an important part of this.\nThe fashion industry is among the world’s largest polluters, so finding ways of creating sustainable clothing is one of the most effective methods of reducing environmental impact. Sustainable fashion can take many forms, and there are a few key ways of making clothing more sustainable.\nOne way to make clothing more sustainable is to use eco-friendly materials. Natural materials, like organic cotton and bamboo, are renewable sources and can be grown without damaging the environment.\nThere are also many recycled materials that can be used in clothing, such as recycled plastic bottles, which are a great way to reduce waste and emissions.\nAnother way to make clothing more sustainable is to make sure that the clothing is made in a responsible way. It is important to make sure that the clothing is produced in a way that is safe for workers and is not damaging to the environment.\nMany fashion companies are now taking steps to ensure that their production processes are sustainable, from using ethical labor practices to using renewable energy sources.\nFinally, sustainable fashion also focuses on the quality of clothing. Companies are now using methods like slow fashion and upcycling, which help to reduce waste and extend the life span of clothing.\nBy creating durable and well-made clothing that can be worn for years, fashion companies can help reduce the impact of the fashion industry on the environment.\nSustainable fashion is the way of the future, and there are many ways to make sure that our clothing is eco-friendly and responsibly made. By focusing on eco-friendly materials, production processes, and high-quality clothing, the fashion industry can make apositive impact on the environment and help create a more sustainable future.\nThe sustainable fashion revolution has made incredible progress in recent years due to increasing consumer awareness and demand. It is a movement that recognizes the importance of creating clothing while minimizing the negative impacts on the environment.\nAlthough the challenges are great, the potential benefits of sustainable fashion are even greater. With a greater focus on materials that are sourced sustainably and clothing that is made to last, sustainable fashion can play an important role in reducing our impact on the environment and promoting a more equitable and sustainable lifestyle.\nAs individuals, we can be more conscious of the materials we use and the clothes we buy, and we can also actively seek out sustainable fashion brands that promote a healthy, sustainable fashion industry. By committing to sustainable fashion, we can help ensure a brighter and more sustainable future for fashion and the planet."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:645e4406-44bf-49d4-973d-bfc37f931d37>","<urn:uuid:dd06e4f4-ae32-4ab6-ab0b-35a963876905>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the recommended storage times in the refrigerator compare between raw poultry and salads containing poultry, and what safety measures should be taken when handling both?","answer":"Raw poultry (chicken or turkey pieces) should be stored for only 1-2 days in the refrigerator, while prepared poultry salads (like chicken salad) can be safely stored for 3-5 days. When handling both, it's essential to prevent cross-contamination by using different sets of utensils for raw and prepared foods, storing raw poultry on the bottom shelf of the fridge to prevent spill contamination, and maintaining good hygiene by properly washing hands and utensils. Raw poultry must be cooked thoroughly until the meat changes from pink to white throughout to destroy harmful bacteria.","context":["Many of us have experienced food poisoning at some point in our lives, and while it’s not usually serious, it can be unpleasant.\nSymptoms of food poisoning may include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps, fever, headache and weakness, and they can occur anywhere from a few hours to a few weeks after you have eaten contaminated food.\nWhat causes food poisoning?\nFood poisoning is an acute illness caused by consumption of contaminated or poisonous food, most commonly contaminated by bacteria, chemicals, molds and viruses.\n- Bacteria: Campylobacter, E. coli, Listeria and salmonella are the most common causes of bacterial food poisoning.\n- Viruses: Norovirus accounts for most cases of viral food poisoning, and is often the result of poor hygiene - including personal hygiene, during food preparation.\n- Parasites: Tapeworm, ringworm and protozoa are the most common food-borne parasites. In the latter group, Toxoplasma gondii is responsible for the most severe cases of food poisoning.\nReducing your risk of food poisoning\nFood that is contaminated with food poisoning bacteria smells, looks and tastes normal.\nKnowing the type of micro-organism that caused your food poisoning can be helpful in treating it, however, being selective about what you eat and how you handle, store and prepare foods is essential in preventing food poisoning in the first place.\nFollow these six tips to minimize your exposure to contaminated foods:\n- Avoid raw or undercooked foods: In their raw or unprocessed state, certain high-risk foods including meat, poultry, shellfish and dairy products, can often be contaminated with a large number of food poisoning microorganisms. Only by thoroughly cooking at temperatures between 70-82°C, or in the case of dairy items like milk and cheese, through pasteurization, can these bacteria be destroyed.\nWith poultry, properly cooked means white meat must have changed from pink to white all the way through, while fish or seafood should be cooked until opaque. Cooking beef or lamb thoroughly doesn’t have to mean ‘well-done’; with steaks, cutlets or joints you can still have some pink meat inside, as long as they are correctly cooked on the outside. Burgers and sausages, however, should be cooked all the way through. Using a thermometer is helpful in judging whether foods are cooked to the required temperature.\n- Wash and disinfect fruit and vegetables: Soak fruit and vegetables in water salt solution for 5 minutes, before gently brushing and rinsing with clean water.\n- Discard out-of-date foods: If food has passed its use-by-date, there’s an increased risk of harmful micro-organisms having developed within it. Even if it smells and looks okay, you should avoid eating it to stay on the safe side.\n- Pay attention to temperature: Always store perishable items immediately and at an appropriate temperature. Keep your fridge set to below 5°C and your freezer at -18°C. Return foods, particularly dairy items or those containing dairy products, to the fridge as soon as you have finished using them.\n- Prevent cross-contamination: This applies to both preparation and storage. Use different sets of utensils and equipment for preparing raw meat, poultry, fish, shellfish and vegetables or ensure proper cleaning and disinfection of utensils before switching to preparation of ready to eat foods. Store raw meat, poultry, shellfish and fish away from other foods, and in the bottom shelf of the fridge to prevent any spill contamination.\n- Maintain good hygiene: Pathogenic micro-organisms can easily be spread if hands aren’t adequately washed before or during handling food. The same goes for kitchen utensils and equipment. Wash at a sufficiently high water temperature and rinse off each item with clean water.\nAdvice for eating out\nTaking preventative action against food poisoning is easier at home where you’re fully in control of the foods you buy and how they are stored and prepared. However, when you eat out you can also take steps to minimize your risk:\n- Be cautious of dishes with raw ingredients: That’s not to say no sushi or steak tartare, just to be careful when eating it – if it doesn’t smell or look right, or has been sitting out for a long time, it’s wise to avoid it. Equally, if your dish turns up with meat, poultry, fish, shellfish or eggs that look undercooked or not to your liking, don’t hesitate to send it back to the kitchen.\n- Pay attention to cleanliness: Be selective about where you eat. Choose restaurants or cafes that look clean, tidy and organized, online and magazine reviews can also be a good indicator of restaurant hygiene, as well as food and service quality.\n- Look for food rotation: If you’re at a buffet, take note of whether the dishes are being served at an appropriate temperature, and how frequently they are being replaced or replenished.","How to store food in a fridge safely, How long can food be kept in a fridge\nThe recommended storage times of food in a refrigerator or fridge has been recommended by many reputable agencies world wide.

The important thing to remember is not to open the fridge when there is no electricity, everytime the door of the fridge is opened the cold air in the fridge escapes and hot air takes its place, raising the temeperature of the food inside. How long can food be in a fridge without power depends mainly on the insulation efficiency of the fridge. Almost all manufacturers have their fridges insulated with PUF (Poly Uratane foam) whic is one of the best insulating materials. LG recently claims to have special fridges which can stay cold and preserve food inside for longer times without power.\nAdvantage of buying AC, Fridge, Washing Machine, etc. online\nBuying online fridges, washing machines, dishwashers and other major kitchen appliances is now the better option in India, just like it is in the USA and other advanced countries. There are several advantages of buying online. First of all, you get unbeatable bargain prices. Secondly, you get new and genuine products. Other benefits include no interest EMI payments, able to return the product for a full refund if not satisfied, etc.\nJust to give you an example, below are some of the benefits Amazon India, the leading global online retailer, offered in India during their last sale.

{"question":"How do biochromes and guanine crystals differ in creating animal camouflage colors?","answer":"Biochromes are microscopic natural pigments that produce colors chemically by absorbing some wavelengths of light and reflecting others. In contrast, guanine crystals work physically by reflecting light - these crystals can expand and contract to change an animal's appearance. Some organisms like insects and spiders use these guanine crystals for signaling, confusing predators, or camouflage, while biochromes create fixed colorations that are passed genetically from parent to offspring.","context":["Most animal species in the world have developed some sort of natural camouflage that helps them find food and avoid attack. The specific nature of this camouflage varies considerably from species to species.\nThere are several factors that determine what sort of camouflage a species develops:\n- Camouflage develops differently depending on the physiology and behavior of an animal. For example, an animal with fur will develop a different sort of camouflage than an animal with scales, and an animal that swims in large schools underwater will develop different camouflage than one that swings alone through the trees.\n- An animal's environment is often the most important factor in what the camouflage looks like. The simplest camouflage technique is for an animal to match the \"background\" of its surroundings. In this case, the various elements of the natural habitat may be referred to as the model for the camouflage.\n- Since the ultimate goal of camouflage is to hide from other animals, the physiology and behavior of an animal's predators or prey is highly significant. An animal will not develop any camouflage that does not help it survive, so not all animals blend in with their environment the same way. For example, there's no point in an animal replicating the color of its surroundings if its main predator is color-blind.\nFor most animals, \"blending in\" is the most effective approach. You can see this sort of camouflage everywhere. Deer, squirrels, hedgehogs and many other animals have brownish, \"earth tone\" colors that match the brown of the trees and soil at the forest ground level. Sharks, dolphins and many other sea creatures have a grayish-blue coloring, which helps them blend in with the soft light underwater.\nThere are two ways in which animals produce different colors.\n- Biochromes, which are microscopic, natural pigments in an animal's body, produce colors chemically. Their chemical makeup is such that they absorb some colors of light and reflect others. The apparent color of a pigment is a combination of all the visible wavelengths of light that are reflected by that pigment.\n- Animals may also produce colors via microscopic physical structures. Essentially, these structures act like prisms, refracting and scattering visible light so that a certain combination of colors are reflected. Polar bears, for example, actually have black skin but appear white because they have translucent hairs. When light shines on the hairs, each hair bends it a little bit. This bounces the light around so that some of it makes it to the surface of the skin and the rest of it is deflected back out, producing white coloration. In some animals, the two types of coloration are combined. For example, reptiles, amphibians and fish with green coloration typically have a layer of skin with yellow pigment and a layer of skin that scatters light to reflect a blue color. Combined, these layers of skin produce green. To learn more about coloration and light, check out How Light Works.\nBoth physical and chemical coloration is determined genetically; they are passed on from parent to offspring. A species develops camouflage coloration gradually, through the process of natural selection. In the wild, an individual animal that more closely matches its surroundings is more likely to be overlooked by predators, and so lives longer. Consequently, the animal that matches its surroundings is more likely to produce offspring than an animal that does not match. The camouflager's offspring will likely inherit the same coloration, and they will also live long enough to pass it on. In this way, the species as a whole develops ideal coloration for survival in their environment.\nThe means of coloration depends on an animal's physiology. In most mammals, the camouflage coloration is in the fur, since this is the outermost layer of the body. In reptiles, amphibians and fish, it is in the scales; in birds it is in the feathers; and in insects it is part of the exoskeleton. The actual structure of the outer covering may also evolve to create better camouflage. In squirrels, for example, the fur is fairly rough and uneven, so it resembles the texture of tree bark. Many insects have a shell that replicates the smooth texture of leaves.\nCamouflaging coloration is very common in nature -- you see it to some degree in the majority of species. But it is much less common for an animal to be able to change its coloration to match a changing environment. In the next section, we'll look at a few of the animals that use this sort of adaptive camouflage.","The art of deception: Mimicry and camouflage\nCamouflage and mimicry. Two key strategies built on deception, and present in a surprising number of rainforest residents. Each tactic can be simplified and distilled to one or two key ideas, but I am not going to do that. These are rich, complex and endlessly fascinating topics deserving of exploration and explanation.\nCamouflage in its simplest form is crypsis. It is simply blending in to one’s environment. I say simply, but in reality, there is nothing simple about it. It involves the evolution of colours, and patterns over time. Moreover, crypsis is only effective when a suitable substrate or background is chosen. A leaf-mimicking katydid would be wholly out of place and easily picked off out in the open or on a tree trunk. Thus there must be some kind of feedback between the animal and its environment to ensure effective use of its camouflage. But that leaf-mimicking katydid of which we just spoke is more than simply colours and patterns, it is shape and form. Enter masquerade. This is a relatively new term used to describe the evolution of different shapes to approximate an environmental, non-animate object. All well and good. Show me the money (or leaf-mimicking katydid as the case may be)!\nSo, these animals essentially have Harry Potter’s cloak of invisibility right? Why don’t all animals employ this strategy? Well, Sani is a magical place, but it isn’t Hogwarts. Camouflage though remarkable has its limitations and drawbacks. As we just covered, camouflage is only effective when the proper background is selected. However, what if that background is either not available or sub-optimal? Well I’m glad you asked! Some insects and animals have evolved the ability to actually change colours and patterns, increasing their mobility and expanding their range. This isn’t simply the realm of the chameleons, but also amphibians and even some insects. Without delving too deeply into the biochemistry and physics of light and how it relates to specialized cells, basically, chromatophores, pigment containing cells which may also reflect light change orientation resulting in a change in appearance. Alternatively, some insects and spiders contain light-reflecting guanine crystals, whose expansion and contraction can be used to either signal, confuse or camouflage. Some organisms have built variation into their very DNA. Certain genes, ones which control colour and pattern, which can be modified without impacting the entire organism are magnets for such mutation hotspots, and even within a single brood, siblings can appear very different to one another. Whether this is true genetic variation or epigenetics (chemical modification of the DNA through the addition/subtraction of chemical groups associated with the DNA which impact gene expression, rather than the modification of the DNA base pairs (Adenine, Guanine, Cytosine, Thymine) themselves) is a question for a directed study. However, sometimes strategies fail, sometimes you have the wrong shaped screwdriver. It is still an exquisite tool, but when things go awry and need to be fixed, it’s not going to going to open up that macbook air (that for some reason uses a proprietary, special order, not commonly used pentalobed head. I mean come on Apple, seriously?!!). Others, find their way onto the menu, and if they have not yet mated, their poor genetic constitution dies with with them (is selected against), enabling more phenotypic (physiological) and hence genetically suitable individuals of the species to carry on.\nAnd there’s more! Even when crypsis/camouflage is behaving as it should, it is still a trade off. This isn’t a blank cheque to pass unnoticed. The animal must change it’s behavior to suit its environment. If you are a moss mimic, and then you stray from the moss, you risk increased predation rates. Even though perhaps the most succulent leaves and the tastiest fruits, are elsewhere. For this reason most camouflaged creatures are active by night, when visual predation is at its nadir (while there are still some specialized visual predators, most rely on their other senses, olfaction, proprioception, acoustic, etc…). Through behavioral complementation of their physiological adaptation, they are able to minimize risk.\nCamouflage is a complex world unto itself, with epizoons, symbiotic relationships between organisms, predation, parasitization, a wealth of overlapping life strategies. Books have been written and reams of information exist to explore, which I strongly encourage everyone to do, because this is just the cap of the mushroom, there’s a whole world below ground.\nBefore delving into the world of subterfuge and mimicry, where nothing is at it seems, it is worth exploring aposematism, or bright, contrasting warning colouration, which can often form the basis for mimicry.\nYellow and black, a strident warning to potential predators of toxicity and unpalatability. Yet how did this come to be? How do you get from palatable and vulnerable to toxic beauty?\n‘De novo’ (from new) biosynthesis of toxins is a possibility, though more common, and potentially less work, is bioaccumulation or biological magnification. This strategy involves an organism usually adapted to a host plant, feeding, sequestering, concentrating, and perhaps slightly modifying biochemical constituents in the plant’s sap. These toxic compounds provide a degree of safety as animals come to learn and associate them with colors and patterns like those seen here.\nExcellent strategy, no? But that’s not the entire story. This toxic lifestyle is not without its cost. Sequestration and modification of these biochemical compounds requires the right tools for the job, whether that be specialty enzymes or specific cells or organs to hold this hazardous soup and prevent poisoning oneself. This adaptation while obviously beneficial can slow growth and development, allowing faster growing competitors the opportunity to out-compete. Moreover, an organism’s evolution doesn’t happen in a vacuum. The plants meanwhile are modifying their biochemical constitution in the ‘hopes’ of ridding themselves of these essentially parasitic grazers and the predators are evolving means of detoxifying themselves and increasing their menu options.\nThe development of mimicry has got to be one of the most fascinating topics in evolutionary biology. The complex interrelationship between species which has come to be reflected in each players’ very DNA and further enhanced by behavioural adaptation which has come to echo that of their model organism, oftentimes with stunning and frightful accuracy. Co-evolution, the so-called evolutionary arms race of one-upsmanship between models and mimics. This is natural history drama sewn into the fabric of this tremendous ecosystem, with new threads being woven daily.\nLet’s follow one such thread. It leads up and into the rainforest mid-story, and to a small colony of ants. Unassuming, if slightly oddly shaped, the turtle or gliding ants (Cephalotes sp.). Of course these ants have their own rich biological history and heritage. But the thread we are following leads further. In fact, it twines itself around these ants, strangling them. It has become inextricably linked. It is the story of Aphantochilus rogersi, the gliding ant-mimicking crab spider. Perhaps one of the very finest of mimics, it’s likeness is awe-inspiring. Most mimics have evolved this habitus, this way of life of mimicry, as a means of protection through verisimilitude with a toxic, or aggressive model. Defensive mimicry in other words. This is not that! Aphantochilus is not content to simply take advantage of the ‘herd immunity’ provided by a semblance to the gliding ant, it also preys on its model. This is offensive mimicry, is less common, and more complex. Feeding on its model requires constant proximity to the source, the nest. This puts Aphantochilus at greater risk. However, its deception is not just chitin-deep, it has changed its behaviour as well. How it feeds. Most crab spiders will grab prey, usually pollinators (since most are ambush predators around flowers and nectar sources). Aphantochilus must grab one ant out of a colony of thousands, without drawing attention to itself, without raising an alarm. It does so by grabbing ants after they have left the nest and they are more isolated and vulnerable. After delivering the fatal bite, they hold their ant prey close. They are feeding, but they also appear as two ants engaged in trophollaxis (food/biochemical liquid exchange) or else an ant carrying a dead companion.\nThe former example highlights what’s known as Batesian mimicry. This is the appearance of one organism to another, more toxic, less palatable, perhaps more dangerous species, in order to garner protection through confusion/conflation with the model. The mimic is often harmless and would otherwise be quite edible. This is the form that has entered the sphere of public consciousness and is used to wow and bedazzle.\nSlightly less known is Mullerian mimicry. This mimicry results in convergence of physiology between one or more organisms, each one toxic or otherwise undesirable. The larger the population with the same or similar traits, the faster the message can be perpetuated, thus reducing incidental/accidental mortalities by would-be predators.\nWhat a wonderful world we live in of never-ending surprises! Join us next week where we explore the the downtrodden, the undervalued, the workaday cockroaches, just trying to get by in this hostile world. I will show you beauty, fantasy, and complexity where many see only revulsion.\nA final note:\nWhenever I point out to the guides or guests here at Sani Lodge an instance of mimicry, or post an image online, there is an initial “Wow” of amazement, followed by fascination. However, I often feel that this is a message delivered in a vacuum, with no broader, penetrating message. It is very easy to treat the similarity between model and mimic with levity, and on the same level as those magic eye, and Facebook feed photos illustrating “hidden objects” which ‘pop’ into view when viewed in the proper way. Mimicry isn’t simply a trick (though confusion and deception is the endgame), it is an important life strategy. It is the result of thousands and millions of years of random mutation, edging towards refinement of incremental, fitness enhancing physiological, biochemical and behavioral traits. It is a system in flux, and is happening now even as I write this.\nHand in hand with the dismissive way mimicry can be viewed, is also the manner in which these mimics are found. I am often told, “You are so lucky. What a lucky find”. And while “luck” or being at the right place at the right time is certainly an aspect of this, finding mimicry in one’s environment is more a question of perception and of seeing what is in fact all around us. In an earlier Facebook post (What, you’re not following us on Facebook?! Enrich your every day and start here), I mentioned search image and how encountering an object primes and develops a search image, such that what once might have been invisible (simply because one didn’t know what one was looking for, and had no visual reference), suddenly becomes apparent. But there is more. It is not simply observation, not just experience and knowledge, but also analysis and an extension of the scientific methodology, since I can also point to various mimics that I have never seen or heard of, simply based on small differences in shape, form, movement, habitus, and environment.\nIn brief, mimicry is one of the most fascinating aspects of evolutionary biology and understanding its mechanism is key to understanding the underlying principles governing evolution. Meanwhile, the search for mimics is an application of knowledge, it is pinging memory cells, and applying reasoning and analysis. Blown out of proportion, am I giving myself way too much credit here for simply spotting a spider amongst ants? Maybe, however one can envisage a scenario, one which isn’t immediately obvious (this isn’t the bursting of bombs or exploding volcano), maybe it’s simply a few hotter days in the year, and a little less glacier on the mountain. Easily dismissed. But by always questioning, always experimenting, never simply accepting, maybe a deeper conclusion can be arrived at, one which reaches beyond the pale of a few less skiing days, and is an important, immediate, and global concern that affects us all. Science is one of humanity’s greatest tools. It isn’t just carried out in the lab, it is a methodology, a way of thinking that can be applied to all problems and all aspects of ones life.\nAuthor: Paul Bertner\nPaul is internationally known for his macro portraits of reptiles, amphibians and insects.

{"question":"What are the key differences between military tactical-level negotiation training and traditional cultural conflict resolution approaches in terms of population engagement?","answer":"Military tactical-level negotiation training historically focuses heavily on lethal engagement and can lead to dehumanization of local populations, with troops viewing everyone as potential enemies due to kill-centric training. This approach emphasizes traditional measures of success like enemy casualties and captured equipment. In contrast, traditional cultural conflict resolution approaches prioritize understanding local customs, building relationships, and engaging with communities through established cultural practices. These traditional methods focus on dialogue, acknowledge the importance of religious and cultural contexts, and aim to rebuild relationships between conflicting parties rather than achieving military objectives. While military training is beginning to incorporate more conflict resolution practices at lower levels, there remains an imbalance between kinetic solutions and cultural engagement approaches.","context":["Battlefield Negotiators-Tactical Level Conflict Resolution\nJohn J. Houser\nMilitary Operations that involve the authorized use of force are often described as a necessary evil, and the definition of success will dictate what methods are used to achieve it. Viewing success as merely lethal action against the enemy presents an inaccurate measure for victory in military operations. Military maneuver elements invest substantial training, equipment and operational focus to fight the enemy and secure territory, which reflects what leaders consider success. However, the necessity to interact with local populations indicates that kinetic operations are only a portion of the full spectrum military continuum. The heart of any conflict, particularly those against an insurgency or guerilla force, centers on the indigenous population. Thus, a more equitable focus to successfully interact with the local populations should be allocated.\nThe measures for success significantly focuses on the battle damage assessment, which consists of enemy killed and captured equipment. While these benchmarks are an important aspect of conflict, they are not the only factor. In 1962, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara summoned Major General Edward Lansdale, Assistant Secretary of Defense for Special Operations, to review the criteria he planned to use to determine U.S. Force success in Vietnam. The factors consisted of numbers of operations, enemy killed and weapons captured. Upon review, Lansdale asserted the measures were meaningless unless the population’s emotions were taken into account. Lansdale referred to the population feelings as the “X” factor, which McNamara almost immediately dismissed.1 The lack of focus on the population led to a prolonged conflict at the expense of tax payer dollars and American lives. Nonetheless, the criteria that military leadership use has remained little changed. If the number of enemy killed forms the basis for success, someone has to kill them.\nMilitary Historian S.L.A Marshall claimed that 75 percent of U.S. troops in actual combat during World War II never fired at the enemy for the purpose of killing, even though they were fired upon and would have been justified to return fire.2 Although Marshall’s claims and research methods were later criticized, they were implemented into modern military training. The changes to military training consisted of: using man-shaped targets instead of bulls-eye targets in marksmanship practice and implementing training more realistic methodologies to resemble how Soldiers actually fight. In a sense, military training needed to reprogram the human instinct against killing their fellow man.\nBy the time the United States become involved in the Vietnam War, 90 percent of U.S. soldiers would fire their weapons at other people.3 The increased probability that Soldiers would engage the enemy with greater lethality would therefore lead to greater success using traditional measures. This was accomplished by enabling the Soldier to disassociate from killing even though in large part they felt it was an unnatural act. To further exacerbate the disassociation, the enemy often becomes dehumanized during training and through colloquial expressions. Ultimately, enemy fighters come from the society in which the U.S. Forces operate. Thus, the probability increases that the U.S. Soldier could translate the same dehumanization of the enemy to the general foreign population as well.\nU.S. Military technological advancements in communications, transportation and weaponry have enabled forces to seize initiative and dominate quicker than ever before. The previously mentioned traditional measures of success (numbers of operations, enemy killed and weapons captured) are gauges to determine whether operations have matured to Phase IV Stability or not. The military concentration on the ability to efficiently operate in phases II and III has resulted in a highly lethal force. However, it creates an unbalanced emphasis given the duration and decentralized nature of Phase IV Stability Operations.\nPhase IV Stability Operations provide the opportunity for an insurgency to either gain or lose influence. Success within this phase can constitute a progression towards civil enabling, whereas a failure can result in a regression to the need to dominate. Insurgents recognize that support of the population, whether by choice or force, is foundational. Joint Publication 3-24, Counterinsurgency Operations (COIN ) also recognizes the importance of the population and states, “the Joint Force needs to adapt approaches based on the following considerations: 1) political control; 2) the population centric nature of COIN; 3) assessing relevant actors; and 4) understanding the Operating Environment.” It also emphasizes that “understanding grievances is key to addressing root causes of insurgency and creating durable stability.”4 (JP 3-24) Essentially, the focus centers on understanding why actors conduct the actions they do. This understanding equates to one of Sun Tzu’s tenants for military operations, “know your enemy as yourself.”5\nUnderstanding the enemy as “you” requires military forces to reexamine the dehumanizing qualities that have been psychologically instilled during training to kill in order to facilitate stability operations. Understanding the population has the potential to create a climate in which an enemy cannot operate or an insurgency be initiated. Political messaging will occur from both friendly and enemy sides throughout the duration of conflict, and the population serves as the target audience. To combat enemy messaging, military forces merely recognizing the population underemphasizes their importance. The local people are the center of gravity and require special tactics.\nField Manual 3-07.31, Chapter VII focuses on Conflict Resolution. It states there are three basic methods to reach an agreement: negotiation, mediation and arbitration and provides associated definitions.6 Specifically, “It [negotiation] is a central technique in conflict resolution. Service members will rarely negotiate a major agreement between belligerents, but they should have a basic understanding of the art of negotiation.” Contact with the indigenous population becomes inevitable in any conflict. Therefore, service members should not only understand cultural nuances, but also have an ability to conduct conflict negotiation at a tactical level.\nIn Iraq and Afghanistan, once the U.S. military secured an area, they inherited the preexisting social issues of the area not just the real estate. Per JP 5-0, “The joint force may be required to perform limited local governance.”7 However, it took authoritative regimes to maintain order between opposing sides of Islam in Iraq, and between opposing tribes in Afghanistan. Absent these authoritarian structures, the indigenous populations fought shadow wars between themselves and against U.S. forces. A lack of in depth understanding on the local population and a focus on kinetic targeting caused operations to stall in Phase IV arguably longer than required. Furthermore, the focus on the more traditional measures for success meant information that could have assisted stability efforts was largely marginalized.\nInformation is a powerful tool, if effectively used. Conflict resolution relies on readily available information more easily obtained compared to kinetic targeting data. However, “the tendency to overemphasize detailed information about the enemy at the expense of the political, economic, and cultural environment that supports it becomes even more pronounced at the brigade and Regional Command levels.”8 Military units operating at the Forward Operating Base are often aware of the enemy situation that they are surrounded by. However, in a conflict where the enemy conceals itself within the population, detailed information about the populace becomes as equally vital. Moreover, to effectively engage the local population’s leadership at key leader engagements, lower echelon military leaders require a more profound knowledge of the human terrain.\nDavid Smock characterizes the keys for success as: 1) all sides agreeing on a clear purpose; 2) religious faith comes with a dependence on a higher deity; 3) a desire to build a relationship with their neighbor; 4) all sides agree on the participants, and their ability to make decisions.9 The keys for success should be identified prior to the meeting to ensure the highest likelihood for a more positive outcome. With any initial contact, the main goal is to secure a second meeting. Therefore, the initial meeting should have a minimal agenda in order to manage expectations. Pre-identifying clear objectives and who can make decisions requires in depth knowledge of the local population. As previously mentioned, there tends to be overemphasis on identifying who to kill, rather than who can bring peace. Absent information related to who can bring peace and the inter-group dynamics of the area, the meeting could occur with a military host unaware that important people have been unintentionally omitted.\nThe second key to success, Abrahamic faiths come with a dependence on God, could be substituted based on the environment and local population’s religious foundations.10 However, a deity should at least some level be acknowledged as appropriate. Nonetheless, the examples of Iraq and Afghanistan provide perfect examples of how finding a religious common ground between Abrahamic faiths could be implemented. The commonality of religion can be the backdrop to initiate the conversation, but the desire to build a relationship amongst neighbors presents an even more immediate invitation point. The military unit and the local population in proximity to one another sets the stage for a conversation. Although there may be a shared reluctance for the closeness, this becomes another point of commonality. This will assist to defeat the notion that Marc Gopin described as “othering”. “Othering” consists of, “not only excluding people, but also a way of rejecting certain types of behavior.”11\nThe rejection of cultural differences provides the foundation for dehumanization, which has a direct correlation to a reduction in basic human rights. Security, one basic tenet of human rights, serves as a communal desire to create a safe space and becomes a shared commonality. It functions as both a reason to meet and further progresses in the peace building process.\nThe military leader, can provide indigenous civilians a reasonable expectation of security, but must also set forth the parameters to establish a venue where thoughts can be freely shared. The military leader, or facilitator, should be prepared for a lukewarm reception where all parties will have a level of skepticism towards the process. People, according to Smock, will share their suffering through story. The service member needs to introspectively ask, “How would I feel, if I were in their position?” Simply: “what if I were born here?” These questions and an airing of grievances present one way to determine differences and similarities between the personnel present. During this step, service members will likely, if they have not already done so, begin to re-humanize the population. Similarly, the local population should be encouraged to consider the service members point of view. Any dehumanization the service member had towards the population will become eroded; likewise, the population will begin to view the service members as personal reflection as well. The deconstructed othering by the service members and the local people will serve as the baseline for trust. Establishing an initial trust creates the climate to have a conversation related to Smock’s second step: the identification of basic human needs.\nThe identification of basic human needs should be self-evident once the service member and the local population consider each other’s point of view. However, wisdom comes from understanding different perspectives; therefore, the list of needs should not be assumed or taken for granted. Each individual or group will have common needs, but there may also be unique needs that have not been considered. Posing the question indicates concern and will go a long way for rapport with the population, which could yield a more secure environment. Never taking security for granted the service members should express their need for a cognitive awareness of what occurs outside the base parameter from a local point of view. Military personnel and the local people share a common desire for security, which the locals can assist with. In turn, the military may be able to provide tangible resources such as food or water, whereas the populace can provide a deeper understanding of the local environment. Maintaining two-way communication related to security issues, will yield a greater sense of community and communal obligation.\nAt this point, the parties involved will have established a mutually beneficial relationship and a level of acceptance. The genesis of trust may be tenuous, but it exists. The third step in Smock’s dialogue for peace-building acknowledges wrongdoing. Smock promotes caution in this step because, “when the sins committed against one’s own people far outweigh the committed by one’s own people, it is difficult to admit to anything.”12 Regardless of the conversational complexity, the dialogue needs to take place in order to progress towards a more lasting peace. The service members will possibly have to acknowledge a perceived wrongdoing they have committed. In this instance, reiterating the need for open communication and a continued education on the local environment remains invaluable. However, the most meaningful acknowledgment of wrongdoing is to initiate the process for forgiveness.\nConfronting forgiveness sets one step closer to reconciliation. However, forgiveness does not equate to absolution, and does not free people from the consequences.13 A potential challenge for this step will also be the pressure exerted on the leader at the negotiation table to resist forgiving. Although a representative may recognize the need for forgiveness, he may not want to seem weak amongst a group opposed to forgiveness. John F. Kennedy, in Profile of Courage stated, “Compromise does not mean cowardice. Indeed it is frequently the compromisers and conciliators who are faced with the severest tests of political courage as they oppose the extremist views of their constituents.”14 All representatives should be advised that a functional process requires forgiveness. If they are truly leaders that are appropriate to attend the meeting, they should have the requisite influence within their group. The forgiveness process takes time and representatives should be urged to continue discussing the situation. A break in the dialogue will likely be met with a renewal to violence because there has been no resolution. Ensuing violence will destabilize the area and create further violence, thereby strengthening the enemy and weakening U.S. Forces.\nThe final step in Smock’s dialogue for peace-building consists of addressing issues of justice.15 Justice in this sense does centers on the restoration of relationships between people related to fairness, and a pronounced equitable distribution of basic human needs. This step codifies the resolution and restores balance to the area. For the service member participating in this process, it may not be accomplished during their tenure. The complex and time consuming process requires detailed record keeping facilitating continuity between unit rotations. Ample effort to attain detailed information on the enemy situation commonly occurs; however, there should be an equally exhaustive amount of data on the local population.\nMilitary doctrine related to stability operations exists, and serves as a guide to military personnel. However, the intended audience is limited to higher echelons, even though more frequent interaction occurs at lower levels. Field Manual 3-07 Stability Operations dated June 2014 captures this disparity stating that, “The principal audience for FM 3-07 is leaders and planners at the battalion level and above.”16 Conflicts for the foreseeable future will be fought and won at the street level from Forward Operating Bases with decentralized command and control structures. The decentralization means troops require an even greater level of cross training than ever before.\nKilling is not an innate act, and reason dictates military training should focus on this complex skill to create troops who will effectively engage the enemy. Yet, conflicts where the enemy hides amongst the population means troops will have a tendency to view everyone as the enemy. Dehumanization based on kill centric training bolsters enemy mobility and their sphere of influence. The mindset that “everyone is the enemy” has the potential to cause human rights abuses, war crimes, and population alienation absent war fighters cross-trained as a true Solider-Statesman. However, viewing everyone as “friendly” represents the other extreme, which can lead to complacency. Mitigating security degradation becomes another justification for instruction that strikes a balance between executing targeted lethality and tactical diplomacy. In reality, population re-humanization through conflict resolution practices increases the service member’s ability to delineate between hostile threats (enemy) and force multipliers (population).\nAfter years of deployments to Iraq and Afghanistan, those engaged at the street level of war have learned lessons related to interaction with local populations as impromptu battlefield negotiators through trial and error. However, Soldiers are not provided a rifle and told, “You’ll learn how to use it when you need it.” Therefore, military training needs to incorporate more conflict resolution practices at the lowest echelons vice an unbalanced reliance on kinetic solutions.\n1.

{"question":"What were the traditional purposes of Jadhu Hiti water reservoirs in Nepal, and how do they relate to modern global water scarcity challenges?","answer":"Jadhu Hiti were stone reservoir tanks in Nepal that served multiple social and practical purposes. They provided drinking water for travelers and pedestrians, especially in areas with sparse settlements, and were often built alongside rest houses (Sattal). The tradition was linked to religious beliefs, with locals required to fill these tanks when fetching water from community wells to ensure fresh water availability. The tanks were built with special sandstone and had protective coating to maintain water quality. Today, these heritage structures face neglect and are being replaced by modern alternatives like vending machines. This historical water management system is particularly relevant given current global freshwater scarcity issues, where two-thirds of the global population (over 4 billion people) face acute water stress at least one month per year. While the global population has tripled over the past century, water usage has increased sixfold, leading to predictions that by 2030, water demand could exceed available supply by 40%.","context":["Jadhu Hiti, known as Jaru Hiti natively or Jaldroni is a unique way of creating a reservoir tank for pedestrians and travellers.\nThe Jadhu Hiti shows how Nepali society back then cared for everyone, even the trespassers. One could find Jadhu Hiti and Falchaa (resting area) frequently dotted the ancient town. But sadly, these intangible heritages are neglected these days in the name of modernity.\nDuring the old days, there were no vehicles thus people had no choice but to walk to travel far and wide. The society, keeping such social things in mind, had built Falcha and Sattal (rest houses) along the way. Quite often, Jadhu Hiti was constructed in places with sparse settlements so that the thirsty travellers could quench their thirst. A Sattal is usually accompanied by a Jadhu Hiti. It also avoided the awkward social interaction for those who are too shy to ask for water from strangers.\nJadhu Hiti, the stone reservoir tank that almost resembles the Walle robot (on the photo), is assembled by fixing a rectangular stone tank on a wall with the three vertical stone columns supporting it. Two horizontal line holes that look like eyes are created to pour water into the tank and a nose-like nozzle protruding at the bottom of the tank is a tap. The nozzle has a cork fixed in its mouth. Thirsty pedestrians could uncork the nozzle, cup hands to drink water and put the cork back. The deity motif on top of the tank blesses the people who save water on the tank and also who drinks from it. These reservoirs were made up of special sandstone and had a particular coating on the inside which discouraged any external organisms to thrive and this would also help in retaining the moisture and favourable temperature of the water.\nThe tradition of filling water into the Jadhu Hiti is linked with religious belief. According to the tradition, anyone who went to fetch water from a community well or waterspouts had to mandatorily offer water into a Jadhu Hiti, to make sure that Jadhu Hiti always had fresh water. Many local residents of Dhaugal in Patan recall the memories of their mother following the tradition of filling and refilling Jadhu Hiti. It was believed that anyone flouting the tradition would remain thirsty after their death and they would never get water in heaven either.\nMany principles and ethics as such would be induced by ancestors to maintain discipline and keep harmony in society. They often relate or link programs to religious belief and construct a tradition of doing something so that people practised personal hygiene. Storing water regularly in Jadhu Hiti is one of the examples.\nAnother popular example is “Sithi Nakha” celebrated as a day for cleaning water sources like well, pond, waterspouts etc. Before cleaning a well, a lit lamp tied at one end of a rope is sent down before the cleaners. Cleaners carry on with the well-cleaning process if the lamp is still burning, while they do not descend down the well if the lamp-fire goes off because that indicated that serpents residing in well are unhappy. But looking at it scientifically, the fire goes off if the oxygen level deep down is low and it is a religious way to check whether the oxygen level down in the well is favourable.\nWith the massive urbanization in the last 20 years Jadhu Hiti, if still standing, comes alive only in a story and heritage that needs preservation. The tanks do not serve people anymore and in many areas, they are removed because of the lack of restoration idea. Also, they are being replaced by vending machines in Patan where a 2-rupee coin can fetch a water bottle of 200 ml.\nJadhu Hiti which holds story has to be preserved, it’s Nepal’s heritage no matter if it serves purpose or not.\nArticle: Inherited Heritage\nPhoto : Bhaktapurians group","This article has been published here in the scope of the European Citizen Initiative (ECI) People 4 Soil\n- Freshwater scarcity is emerging as a critical systemic risk worldwide. While the global population has tripled over the past century, our use of water has increased sixfold.\n- More than 95 per cent of humanity’s present food supply is produced from the soil.\n- Some 40 per cent of soil used for agriculture globally, is classed as degraded or seriously degraded – i.e. 70 per cent of the topsoil has been lost.\n- The UN FAO has projected that for the planet, net land under crops may have to increase by some 700 million hectares by 2050 to meet predicted global food needs.\n- The loss of food security – through climate (change?) or the loss of soil and water resources – is a major factor in people deciding to quit their homelands in search of new life, whether as economic migrants ahead of a crisis they have foreseen or as refugees fleeing a disaster.\nEmerging scarcities of fresh water and topsoil, combined with the impact of climate change on regional food production, highlight the growing strategic significance of these primary resources for human survival, health and wellbeing as potential drivers of conflict and mass migration to 2050 and beyond. Conversely, there is mounting evidence that conflict and out-migration are far less likely in regions that are well-fed and where these primary resources are well-managed and not disputed-over. We argue with a global population approaching 10 billion in the 2060s, soil and water will be increasingly critical elements in global, regional and national security and must be factored into defence, security and sustainability planning at all levels. The role of food, land and water security in keeping the peace should be more widely understood and acted on.\nFreshwater scarcity is emerging as a critical systemic risk worldwide. Of all the emerging global resource scarcities (oil, strategic minerals, timber, fish etc) it is the one arriving most rapidly and universally.\nTo support the average citizen of Earth takes around 1,386 tonnes of fresh water a year. This ‘water footprint’ consists of all the water used to produce our food, consumer products, or provide the services on which we rely: our indirect use of water is many times larger than our personal use. In total, humanity uses more than 9 trillion tonnes of fresh water annually. While the global population has tripled over the past century, our use of water has grown sixfold.(1)\nTwo thirds of the human population – more than 4 billion people – already face acute water stress at least one month a year. About half of these live in India and China.(2)\nThe combination of growing populations, rising economic demand for food, megacity and industrial water consumption and climate change mean that “The ultimate consequence is that, by 2030, demand for water could be 40% greater than supply available,” according to a study by the UN University.(3)\nKey elements of contemporary water scarcity are:\n- The dire condition of the world’s major rivers, especially in semi-arid regions. The impact of their 6,000+ dams on downstream food and water security.(4)\n- The drying up and pollution of lakes and inland seas worldwide.(5)\n- Over-exploitation of groundwater (95% of Earth’s fresh water) in every region where it is used to grow food or support megacities and the energy sector. One third of the world’s major groundwater basins are now rated ‘in distress’.(6)\n- Unprecedented decline in mountain glaciers (which supply major river systems).(7)\n- Impact of climatic fluctuations on regional water supplies in eg California, Sao Paulo (Brazil)(8), central India(9) and China(10).\n- Increasing frequency of drought in countries that seldom before experienced it, eg New Zealand(11), UK(12).\n- Growing confrontation between farmers and energy corporates (coal, gas, oil, tar sands etc) over access to, and use of, water around the world(13).\nThe risks of conflict over water scarcity have been flagged by many eminent figures, notably UN chiefs Boutros Boutros-Ghali, and Ban Ki-Moon: “(water scarcities) create tensions in conflict-prone regions. Too often, where we need water we find guns.”\nPeter Gleick of the Pacific Institute maintains a timeline documenting water conflicts over the past 5000 years, noting a rise in both intensity and frequency in the 21st century: http://www2.worldwater.org/conflict/timeline/\nTogether these factors point to increasing scarcity of fresh water at a time of strongly rising demand, leading to potential for conflicts at various levels.\nRegions where the risk of water scarcity leading to mass migration include:\n- The North China plain where the aquifer that feeds 400m people is two thirds empty and is a major factor in Chinese land-grabs in Africa and elsewhere.\n- The north Indian plain, the bread-basket of India which feeds 700m, where groundwater levels have been falling at 1 metre+ a year for over a decade.\n- The Middle East, where acute water scarcity is a factor in the Syrian crisis, in international disputes (eg Israel/Syria) in Iraqi instability and Saudi/Emirates land-grabs in Africa.\n- North Africa, where a food-basket failure on the scale of the one which brought down the Roman Empire in the 3rd century, could lead to massive migration into southern Europe.\n- In the US central mid-west where it is estimated that water taken in the last 150 years will require 6000 years to replenish.\n- Central Asia where drought and dam-building threaten the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers which supply several nations.(14)\nWater crises ranked first in the World Economic Forum’s list of most impactful global risks for 2015, and third in 2016 (having been overtaken by climate inaction and weapons and mass destruction).(15)\nThe WEF’s ‘most likely’ risk was “largescale involuntary migration” triggered by conflict, extreme weather events (climate failure) and natural disasters.\nMore than 95% of humanity’s present food supply is produced from the soil. However, that may not always be the case in future.\n“A rough calculation of current rates of soil degradation suggests we have about 60 years of topsoil left,” Sydney University’s Professor John Crawford warned in a TIME magazine interview in 2012.\n“Some 40% of soil used for agriculture around the world is classed as either degraded or seriously degraded – the latter means that 70% of the topsoil, the layer allowing plants to grow, is gone. Because of various farming methods that strip the soil of carbon and make it less robust as well as weaker in nutrients, soil is being lost at between 10 and 40 times the rate at which it can be naturally replenished,” he said.(16)\nIn contrast the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation has projected “that for the world as a whole, net-land under crops may have to increase by some 70 million ha by 2050” in order to meet predicted global food needs.\nThe US Geological Survey has estimated that human activity – mainly farming and land development – is causing the loss of about 74 gigatonnes of topsoil every year(17). This makes it one of the largest, if not the largest, human impact on the planet.\nThe University of Sheffield, in a 2015 paper, noted that nearly 33 per cent of the world’s arable land had been lost to erosion or pollution between 1975 and 2015.(18)\nAuthors such as Jared Diamond and David Montgomery have documented how soil loss contributed to the collapse of previous civilisations, including the Mayans, Greeks and Romans.\nIn the drylands, which account for 44% of the world’s food production system (including most of Australia), “arable land loss (is) estimated at 30 to 35 times the historical rate”, according to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD)(19). On average 12m additional hectares are being lost to desert each year. Paralleling this is a net loss in world forest cover of 6.6 million hectares/year.(20)\nUNCCD executive secretary Monique Barbut links land degradation with the Syrian crisis and civil war, and conflicts in the Sahel, Mali and Darfur: “land is so closely linked to basic human needs, such as access to food and water. If land degradation interferes with the fulfilment of these needs, it can lead to conflicts over scarce land and water resources, spark food riots or turn smallholder farmers into refugees”.(21) Conversely, she notes, “The Great Green Wall for the Sahara and Sahel Initiative is bringing a coordinated and harmonised response to food security and peace.”\nThe United Nations Interagency Framework Team for Preventive Action has noted that land conflicts tend to become violent when they are “linked to wider processes of political exclusion, social discrimination, economic marginalization, and a perception that peaceful action is no longer a viable strategy for change”. The framework goes even further and states that “land issues readily lend themselves to conflict. Land is an important economic asset and source of livelihoods; it is also closely linked to community identity, history and culture. Communities, therefore, can readily mobilize around land issues, making land a central object of conflict.”\nTraditionally famine has been viewed as a consequence, rather than a driver, of warfare. However, the Oslo Peace Research Institute challenged this perception in a paper arguing the risks of conflict were in recent decades much higher in regions suffering insecurity of food land and water – and much lower in places (such as Europe, North America or Australasia) where those resources were secure.(22)\nThese observations, and many more beside, support a view that food, land and water will play a more critical role in global security and the risks of conflict during the middle part of the 21st Century – and equally, that securing them can reduce the tensions that lead to war.\nFinally, it should be noted that, while the world currently wastes up to 40% of its food in the production/market chain – enough to feed 3 billion people – no-one has yet devised an affordable system for redistributing food from surplus regions to deficit regions which cannot afford to pay for it on the scale required to overcome hunger. The proven solution lies in protecting and enhancing local food sufficiency through care of land, water and enhanced production systems. Furthermore, the waste can be eliminated by recycling nutrients through the megacities in advanced ‘urban agriculture’ systems.\nClimate: threat multiplier\nClimate will have a major influence over geopolitical security and risk of conflict in the C21st, primarily through its impacts on the food chain.\nAs former-US Secretary of State John Kerry observed in February 2014: “In a sense, climate change can now be considered another weapon of mass destruction, perhaps the world’s most fearsome weapon of mass destruction.” In 2015 a Pentagon study found climate change is a security risk, “because it degrades living conditions, human security and the ability of governments to meet the basic needs of their populations”. More recently, the UK’s Climate Envoy, Rear Admiral Neil Morisetti, said it posed as grave a threat to Britain’s security and economic resilience as terrorism and cyber-attacks.(24)\nClimate change is, in effect, a threat multiplier of the risks already generated through insecurity of the primary resources of food, land and water.(25)\nFood insecurity was a factor in the mass migration of 10 million Bangladeshis into India in the 1970s. Drought and failing agricultural systems are thought to have driven 1.5 million Syrians out of rural areas and into cities in the build-up to a civil conflict that led to 11 million Syrians fleeing their country. While scarcities of food, land and water seldom, of themselves, directly trigger conflicts – Darfur, Rwanda and Somalia may be exceptions – they are potent drivers in the background. As farmer and former US President Jimmy Carter said: “There can be no peace until people have enough to eat. Hungry people are not peaceful people.”(26)\nLikewise, the loss of food security – through climate or loss of the necessary soil and water resources – is a major factor in people deciding to quit their homelands in search of a new life, whether as ‘economic migrants’ ahead of a crisis they have foreseen or as refugees fleeing a disaster. The exceptions to this were the Russian and Chinese famines of the mid-20th Century, when people chose to die where they were rather than move to foreign, largely-unknown countries and cultures. In the 21st century, with its ubiquitous mass culture of the internet and social media, people may be more inclined to seek food and security elsewhere.\nThis poses the undoubted risk of migration events numbering in the tens, possibly even hundreds of millions, depending on the scale of the resource failure – as Europe has recently experienced, on a more limited scale, from the Middle East and Africa.\nIt is important to understand that such disasters are preventable, with sufficient recognition of the driving factors and suitable preventative strategies.\nIn the C21st, we argue, the risk of mass migration events and conflicts driven by insecurity of food land and water is very much higher than in any previous age of human history. Food land and water must therefore be viewed as strategic elements of defence and international security as essential as naval fleets, air power or armies. Neglecting them will raise the risk of conflict and mass migration sharply – while preventing them will yield a peace dividend by removing an important casus belli.\nIt is time to recognise food, land and water as fundamental strategic elements in the world’s future defence and border protection policies. Great investment and knowledge sharing in all three will deliver a significant peace dividend globally.\nJulian Cribb, April 14, 2017\nJulian Cribb is an Australian author and science writer.

{"question":"How do the processes of mineral identification through physical properties compare with the methods used to determine sedimentological conditions in ancient rock formations?","answer":"Mineral identification and sedimentological analysis employ distinct methodological approaches. Mineral identification relies on observable physical properties such as hardness, cleavage, color, luster, and reaction to HCl, which can be tested directly in a laboratory setting using tools like the Mohs Hardness Kit and streak plates. In contrast, determining ancient sedimentological conditions requires interpretative analysis based on the principle of uniformitarianism, where scientists study present-day sedimentary processes to understand how ancient sediments were deposited. While mineral identification can be done through immediate physical testing, sedimentological analysis requires careful examination of rock sequences, consideration of superposition principles, and analysis of younging indicators to reconstruct past depositional environments.","context":["To use all functions of this page, please activate cookies in your browser.\nWith an accout for my.chemeurope.com you can always see everything at a glance – and you can configure your own website and individual newsletter.\n- My watch list\n- My saved searches\n- My saved topics\n- My newsletter\nSedimentology encompasses the study of modern sediments and understanding the processes that deposit them. It also compares these observations to studies of ancient sedimentary rocks. Sedimentologists apply their understanding of modern processes to historically formed sedimentary rocks, allowing them to understand how they formed.\nSedimentary rocks cover most of the Earth's surface, record much of the Earth's history, and harbor the fossil record. Sedimentology is closely linked to stratigraphy, the study of the physical and temporal relationships between rock layers or strata.\nUniformitarian geology, the premise that the processes affecting the earth today are the same as in the past, is the basis for determining how sedimentary features in the rock record were formed. By comparing similar features today - for example, sand dunes in the Sahara or the Great Sand Dunes National Park near Alamosa, Colorado - to the ancient sandstones such as the Wingate Sandstone of Utah and Arizona, of the southwest USA; since both have the same features, both can be shown to have formed from eolian (wind) deposition.\nAdditional recommended knowledge\nSedimentary rock types\nThere are four primary types of sedimentary rocks: clastics, carbonates, evaporites, and chemical.\nImportance of sedimentary rocks\nSedimentary rocks provide a multitude of products which modern and ancient society has come to utilise.\nThe aim of sedimentology, studying sediments, is to derive information on the depositional conditions which acted to deposit the rock unit, and the relation of the individual rock units in a basin into a coherent understanding of the evolution of the sedimentary sequences and basins, and thus, the Earth's geological history as a whole.\nThe scientific basis of this is the principle of uniformitarianism, which states that the sediments within ancient sedimentary rocks were deposited in the same way as sediments which are being deposited at the Earth's surface today.\nSedimentological conditions are recorded within the sediments as they are laid down; and in reference to Salvador Dalí's Persistence of memory, the form of the sediments at present reflects the events of the past and all events which affect the sediments, from the source of the sedimentary material to the stresses enacted upon them after diagenesis are available for study.\nHowever, sedimentological study produces interpretations of past depositional and environmental conditions and care must be taken in analysing sedimentary rocks in a scientific manner in order to gain a picture of the events which occurred within the past.\nThe principle of superposition is critical to the interpretation of sedimentary sequences, and in older metamorphic terrains or fold and thrust belts where sediments are often intensely folded or deformed, recognising younging indicators or fining up sequences is critical to interpretation of the sedimentary section and often the deformation and metamorphic structure of the region.\nFolding in sediments is analysed with the principle of original horizontality, which states that sediments are deposited at their angle of repose which, for most types of sediment, is essentially horizontal. Thus, when the younging direction is known, the rocks can be \"unfolded\" and interpreted according to the contained sedimentary information.\nThe principle of lateral continuity states that layers of sediment initially extend laterally in all directions unless obstructed by a physical object or topography.\nThe principle of cross-cutting relationships states that whatever cuts across or intrudes into the layers of strata is younger then the layers of strata.\nMethodology of sedimentology\nThe methods employed by sedimentologists to gather data and evidence on the nature and depositional conditions of sedimentary rocks include;\nRecent developments in sedimentology\nThe longstanding understanding of how the mudstones and other fine grained sediments form is being challenged as being in error, according to research by geologists at Indiana University (Bloomington) and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The research, which appears in the December 14th edition of Science, counters the prevailing view of geologists that mud only settles when water is placid, instead showing that \"muds will accumulate even when currents move swiftly.\"\nWhat is most interesting for students of the geological and fossil record is how this research potentially overturns the previous view on mudstone deposition, erosion, and re-deposition, as the press release outlines:\n\"The finding feels like something of a vindication, Schieber says. He and his colleagues have (genially) argued about whether muds could deposit from rapidly flowing water. Schieber had posited the possibility after noting an apparent oddity in the sedimentary rock record.\"\n|This article is licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License.

The keys to this definition are the chemical composition and the crystalline structure. Different chemical compositions result in different minerals. A good example is the mineral plagioclase. Plagioclase is a member of the feldspar group, but there is more than one type of plagioclase. Albite and anorthite are two examples. Albite has a chemical composition of NaAlSi3O8, while anorthite's chemical composition is CaAl2Si2O8. Very similar, but different - therefore two different minerals.\nDifferent crystalline structures, or how the atoms and molecules are arranged, result in different minerals. A good example is diamond and graphite. Both minerals are composed of carbon (C). The same chemical composition, but two different crystalline structures - therefore, two different minerals.\nDetermination of the actual chemical composition and crystalline structure of a mineral is difficult without the proper equipment. In an introductory level lab it is impossible for us to determine these two aspects of a mineral. Fortunately, these two aspects determine a mineral's physical properties. How the atoms and molecules are arranged and the strength of the bonding between the atoms result in different physical properties for different minerals. While many minerals share common physical properties, when all of a mineral's physical properties are examined, it often results in a unique set of physical properties which can be used to identify the mineral.\nBelow you will find a chart which defines the physical properties and provides the means for determining the physical property of a mineral sample. These definitions and methods are simplified. Consult your lab manual for detailed discussion.\n|Mineral Physical Properties Chart|\n|Cleavage||Breakage of a mineral along planes of weakness in the crystal structure.||Examine the mineral for areas where the mineral is broken. Look for areas where the light reflects from planar surfaces. This can be easily confused with a crystal face and is the most difficult properties for students to master.|\n|Color||Visible light spectrum radiation reflected from a mineral.||Look at the sample and determine its color - white, black, green, clear, etc.|\n|Crystal Form||Geometric shape of a crystal or mineral.||Examine and describe the geometric shape of the mineral - cubic, hexagonal, etc. Not commonly seen in most introductory lab samples.|\n|Fracture||Breakage of a mineral, not along planes of weakness in the crystral structure.||Examine the mineral for areas where the mineral is broken. Describe the breakage as either irregular or conchoidal (has the appearance of broken glass)|\n|Hardness||Resistance to scratching or abrasion.||Use minerals of known hardness from the Mohs Hardness Kits. Scratch the unknown mineral with a known hardness to determine which mineral is harder.

{"question":"Write down the process differences between yak wool harvesting (khullu) and photosynthesis in terms of their role in natural cycles.","answer":"Yak wool harvesting (khullu) is a natural annual process where the fine under fiber is collected as it falls to the ground or is combed out during summer, as the new growth pushes out the previous year's wool. This material can then be transformed into textile products.\\n\\nPhotosynthesis, on the other hand, is a chemical process where plants absorb CO2 and water, using sunlight energy stored in chlorophyll to produce sugar (C6H12O6) and oxygen. The chemical reaction is: 6 CO2 + 6 H2O + sunlight → C6H12O6 + 6 O2. This process is fundamental to the carbon cycle, allowing plants to create organic compounds and release oxygen into the atmosphere.","context":["Our very first sourcing trip for …in a strange land was memorable for a number of reasons, all of them good! We met some amazing people and visited some incredible places. We also made some wonderful discoveries, not least of which were the beautiful products woven on the Tibetan plateau by an organization called Norlha.\nFor Tibetan nomads, the Yak is paramount. As the buffalo was to the Native Americans of the plains and the Water Buffalo is to agricultural communities throughout South East Asia, the Yak is a source of labour, warmth and nourishment. One company is responsibly capitalizing on this symbiotic relationship in order to make beautiful textiles.\nWe have previously written about them and their work here, but wanted to know more about the people behind the brand. Dechen Yeshi is a true inspiration and the driving force behind the company. She started Norlha with her mother and now lives permanently in Gansu, ensuring that their founding principles are adhered to.\nWe thought we’d ask her some questions. Here’s how we got on…\nCan you give us a brief summary of your background and your links with Tibet?\nMy father is Tibetan and I grew up in a Tibetan household. After I graduated from college in the US, my parents encouraged me to travel to the Tibetan plateau and try and find a life there. I have been here ever since.\nHow did you first get the idea for Norlha?\nMy mother is a lover of textiles. For years she talked about the possibilities of yak wool but she was too busy to undertake a new project in a new area. When I graduated from college, she urged me to collect some yak wool so we could test it in Nepal. We realized that yak wool can be transformed into a beautiful and valuable product, but it also became evident that unless we produced on the Tibetan plateau itself, the nomads would not see any of the added value of the material. And so, not only the brand Norlha was born but also Norlha atelier, the atelier on the roof of the world!\nOur grasp of Tibetan and its dialects are limited at best! Can you please explain the meaning of the word Norlha?\n“Nor” is the Tibetan for wealth. However, it is not limited to material wealth alone. It can mean a wealth of knowledge and for the nomads it is simply the term for yaks. For centuries, the lives of Tibetan nomads have centered around yak. They eat yak butter, cheese and meat. Drink yak milk, live in yak hair tents and use yaks for transportation. Therefore “Nor” for Tibetan nomads are ‘yaks’ which in turn means wealth. “Lha” is the Tibetan for “God”. Norlha is therefore the God of Yaks / wealth.\nWe love the feel, warmth and durability of Khullu as a material. Can you please explain what it is and how it is gathered?\nKhullu is the fine under fibre that keeps an animal warm. As the new khullu grows each year, it pushes out the previous year’s wool and thus the yak sheds during summer. One can simply comb it out or collect it as it falls to the ground.\nAt …in a strange land, ethical and sustainable practices are of paramount importance when selecting products. Can you please briefly describe your commitment to ethical and sustainable practices?\nAt Norlha, ethical and sustainable practices are of the utmost importance. We are unique in Yak khullu companies, in that we have our own atelier where we employ 120 nomads around the year. These people have come to depend upon Norlha as a dependable source of livelihood. Their children would like to learn the craft and we now have a waiting list of up to 100 people, mostly young people who are embracing the opportunity to live in their own village with their families. We are dedicated to continue this mission in teaching people a craft that is based on a locally available raw material and where they are reaping the benefits of the added value. In this way we are commited to being ethical and sustainable.\nThrough the beautiful photography on your website and marketing materials, we have been introduced to the landscape and people of Kanlho. Can you tell us more about the nomadic people you employ?\nOur mission is to attract the younger generation as they are the future. These young adults are mostly nomads with very little to no schooling. For them it is a great opportunity to be able to be surrounded by the nomadic pastures that they are so familiar with, while not having to participate in the arduous life of a nomad.\nWe understand that to create such beautiful textiles you have had to draw upon weaving techniques from other regions. Can you tell us about this?\nOur techniques are largely from Nepal with some influences from Cambodia. We use the handloom for weaving. For felting we use a combination of Finnish felting techniques, local techniques and innovative techniques using machines.\nHow long does it take to create one of your more complex scarves?\nThe time is mostly in the spinning. One woman can only spin 3kgs a month and a single scarf can be 0.5kg. Therefore our handspun collection is the most luxurious and takes the longest to create.\nWhat’s next for Norlha?\nWe hope to be sustainable enough to expand into other neighboring villages.","The Carbon Cycle: Sources and Sinks\nCompounds that contain the element carbon are referred to as \"organic.\" They are present in all living things. Carbon is continually moving among Earth's lithosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere, and atmosphere in various forms: as carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere, sugars or carbohydrates (CnH2nOn) in living organisms, and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) in rocks and minerals, to name just a few. The movement of carbon among Earth's spheres, as diagrammed below, is known as the carbon cycle.\nThe black numbers in the diagram indicate how much carbon is stored in carbon sinks (areas of storage) in billions of tons (gigatons—GtC). The arrows show how carbon moves among Earth’s spheres.\nGreen plants play a very important role in the carbon cycle. They absorb carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere and produce carbon-containing sugars. This process is called photosynthesis. There are two main steps in photosynthesis. First, plants trap the sun's light energy in a compound called chlorophyll. This energy is converted to a chemical form called adenosine triphosphate (ATP). In the second step plants use the energy from ATP to produce sugar (C6H1206). The process of photosynthesis requires water (H2O). It also produces water as well as oxygen (O2). The net chemical reaction for the process of photosynthesis is\n6 CO2 + 6 H2O + sunlight ------> C6H12O6 + 6 O2.\nAnimals eat plants to obtain the energy trapped during photosynthesis. As the animals' bodies break down the carbohydrates in the plant tissue, CO2 is released to the atmosphere. This process is called respiration. The net chemical reaction for the process of respiration is the exact opposite of photosynthesis: 6 O2 + C6H12O6 ------> 6 H2O + 6 CO2. Plants respire also as they break down the organic molecules in themselves in order to release the stored energy. Plants and animals also release CO2 to the atmosphere when they decay.\nWhen dead plants and animals slowly decay under high pressure and high temperatures, they may eventually form pools of energy known as fossil fuels. Coal, oil, and natural gas are fossil fuels. People burn fossil fuels to release the energy stored in them. The energy is used for heat, operating automobiles, etc.\nSince the Industrial Revolution humans have burned increasingly greater amounts of fossil fuels in order to produce more energy. As the practice of burning fossil fuels grows, so does the amount of carbon dioxide emitted to the atmosphere. Historical data from ice cores and modern data collected from the Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii support this.\nAs a greenhouse gas, CO2 increases the rate of global climate change. This is because CO2 contributes so greatly to the greenhouse effect. The sets of graphs below show carbon dioxide variations over thousands of years. Data was collected from various sources, such as ice core sampling. Further below is a graph comparing CO2 and temperature levels over thousands of years. Do you see a distinctive pattern across the data visualizations presented?\nThis figure of temperature and carbon dioxide is from the Marian Koshland Science Museum: Variations of Northern Hemisphere Surface Temperature and Carbon Dioxide. Additional information: The image and text excerpt below are from a website by RickyRoad, a faculty member at U Michigan and who leads a course on climate change problem solving.\n\"In this figure there are variations in the temperature field that are not present in the carbon dioxide field. Scientific rigor requires that we investigate this variability, and with some confidence we can attribute the variability prior to about 1800 to volcanic activity and changes in the sun. There is no doubt that the further back we go from the present time, the greater the uncertainty. We, today, have much better observations of temperature, of solar variability, of volcanic activity, of carbon dioxide; we have better measurements of every quantity. Does the fact that we have better measurements today devalue the knowledge from the past? Change it?\" --Ricky Road\nThere are many cooperative programs around the world that monitor carbon dioxide emissions, sources, and sinks.\nSource: Earth System Research Laboratory—Global Monitoring Division, http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/Photo_Gallery/GMD_Figures/ccgg_figures/tn/ccggmap.png.html\nResearch stations and observatories measure atmospheric carbon dioxide as well as other greenhouse gases, such as methane, carbon monoxide, hydrogen, nitrous oxide, and sulfur hexafluoride.

{"question":"What important tips should you follow when preparing brioche à tête to ensure proper rising and baking?","answer":"Several key tips are essential: First, use only 1.5 to 2-ounce portions of dough per mold. Second, apply egg wash evenly, avoiding large dollops in the crevice where dough meets mold as it will turn to glue and pull the tête sideways. Third, keep the dough moist while rising to prevent a tough skin from forming that would mar the crust and constrain the rise. Fourth, you can snip around the base of the topknot with oiled kitchen shears before baking to prevent fusion and achieve more centered heads. Finally, proof until very soft and poofy, about twice the original size, and bake at 425 degrees for 8-12 minutes.","context":["Well the brioche turned out pretty darn OK yesterday. The crumb was tender, yellow and buttery and the shapes were good. Fewer of the little têtes flopped over than usual, and that was nice, but really beside the point. Personally, I get very irritated by bakers and baking instructors who call any brioche à tête whose head isn’t perfect a failure. Some of the stuffier baking books I’ve seen actually discourage people from attempting them, since perfectly centered tops are so hard to achieve. I don’t know which Parisian pâtisseries these people have been shopping at, but if there’s one where every last little topknot is pointing true North, I’ve never seen it. What a buncha killjoys.\nSure, you’ll get some drunken, nodding heads the first few times you make brioche à tête. Some may even fall clean off. Heck that still happens to me. But darn it, that’s no reason not to keep trying. And in fact there are some time-tested tricks that will significantly improve your odds of creating a perfect tête.\nFirst, don’t overload your molds. Use 1 1/2 to 2-ounce portions of brioche dough in each little brioche mold and no more. Next, coat the brioche as evenly as possible with egg wash before putting them in the oven, being careful to avoid getting big dollops of yolk into the crevice where the dough meets the mold (the egg will turn to glue in the oven, constraining the rise and pulling the tête to one side).\nWhen it comes to shaping the têtes there are several different methods. One simply calls for pulling a small amount of dough off the main portion, rolling it into a little ball, and sticking it to the top with egg. Another similar one calls for rolling the small piece into a teardrop shape, making a hole in the middle of the larger ball, and stuffing the small piece in. In my experience, the first of these two methods results in over half the têtes falling off in the oven. The second, not quite half.\nThe most reliable method I know is the one I will now try to explain. First, roll your 1.6 ounce (that’s my perfect number) dough piece into a ball. If the dough starts sticking and smearing, or just getting too soft generally, apply some more flour. If that doesn’t work just collect it back into a ball and put it back into the fridge to chill for 10 minutes or so and try again.\nNext comes the tête. Put one of your dough balls in front of you and form your hand as though you were about to administer a karate chop. Bring the edge of your hand down to the ball, just off the center, touching it only with your pinky.\nNow, begin a slow sawing motion, rolling the ball back and forth, trying to pull about 20% of the dough away from the main mass while not entirely separating it. The ball will first become oblong, then teardrop-shaped, and will ultimately resemble a bowling pin. When you’re at the point where any more sawing will sever the tête, stop.\n(Tell me, why is it that the really big guys always seem to go for the superfly hat fashion statement? And then always in white? It’s a mystery).\nAnyway, don’t worry about any wrinkles or creases, since they’ll pull out during proofing and baking. One interesting tip I’ve received, and that does seem to work, is to snip around the base of the topknot with oiled kitchen shears before putting the brioche in the oven. This does seem to free the tops, which tend to fuse to the bodies as they proof. The extra freedom does tend to give me more centered heads. Paint them with egg wash and proof until they’re very soft and poofy to the touch, roughly twice their original size. Remember to keep them moist as they rise or a tough skin will form on the exterior, marring the crust and constraining the rise. Paint once more with egg wash just before baking, and bake at 425 for 8-12 minutes.\nSo there you go! Start practicing! Brioche à tête is one hell of a way to impress your friends and neighbors. Though if you’d just as soon keep them all to yourself I can certainly relate. I have a jar of raspberry jam I set aside just for that purpose."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:22b873bd-59f2-4056-a916-82b08b1593e5>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is supply chain risk management and how many companies experienced security breaches from third-party vendors?","answer":"Supply chain risk management (SCRM) involves monitoring for and identifying potential threats to the supply chain. While it cannot completely eliminate risk, it helps avoid issues and create contingency plans to minimize impact on operations and profitability. According to reports, 56% of companies have experienced a cybersecurity breach caused by their third-party vendors, highlighting the importance of managing supply chain risks.","context":["Supply Chain Risk Management\nWhat is Supply Chain Risk Management?\nSupply Chain Risk Management Definition: Supply chain risk management (SCRM) involves monitoring for and identifying potential threats to the supply chain. Although there is no way to completely eliminate risk, many issues can be avoided and contingency plans can be put into place to minimize or mitigate the impact on operations and/or profitability.\nSupply Chain Risk Management Examples: Generally speaking, there are two types of risk associated with supply chains. There are things that are impossible to predict and plan for, such as natural disasters, epidemics, and acts of terrorism, and there are other things that can be planned for, provided an organization has the data necessary to observe and act on early indicators. This may include:\nThe Role of Software Risk Management in Supply Chain Reliability\nBecause there are many potential issues that can impact the supply chain, executives have the difficult duty of assessing which problems are likely to cause the most harm to operations and profitability. Although cyber security is a core focus, there are numerous ways software can impact the reliability and profitability of a supply chain and not all of them are apparent, even to those in IT. While there is some risk involved in the hacking or insertion of malicious code in software, most issues surround unintentional coding errors, which routinely go undetected. As the infrastructure and architecture grow, these errors can create vulnerabilities and cause unexpected conflicts. By identifying these issues in advance and taking steps to reduce their impact, the risk is effectively managed prior to breakdown of the chain. Bear in mind, these errors can occur at a local level as well as at any stage in the supply chain, which is why it’s important for organizations to work with vendors and companies that have systems and transparency in place.\nSupply Chain Risk Management Best Practices\nAutomation: Supplier risk management (SRM) processes, including the collection, management, and analysis of data, should be automated. Human eyes cannot always detect errors, let alone conflicting codes within a system.\nSupplier Transparency: Performance information from suppliers should be readily available and included in analysis.\nEarly Detection: The supply chain risk management process should make use of automation software detect potential red flags before they become a problem.\nClassification: All potential risks should be identified, classified, and prioritized in order to determine which corrective actions offer the greatest ROI.\nPlans & Contingency Plans: A supply chain risk management plan should be developed and include methods for managing imminent risks as well as for minimizing the impact of issues that cannot be prevented or would be cost-prohibitive to prevent.\nMonitoring: Supply chain risk management tools should be used to identify new triggers, even after an assessment and corrections have been carried out.\nCollaboration: SCRM metrics and information should be available to various departments and heads at the same time for easy collaboration regarding supply chain risk management strategies.\nLeadership: SCRM should be overseen by one leader, even if duties are delegated to a team. Historically, organizations that assign a lead, usually an executive or VP, to handle SCRM see the greatest ROI. These organizations are also the only ones to see in excess of 100% ROI on their SCRM efforts.","Maintaining a secure supply chain can be a challenge. Within a supply chain, numerous people, companies, third-party suppliers, and nations are likely involved, which can lead to serious security issues in logistics.\nMany companies depend on their own resources as well as industry standards to fight security issues. Depending on the industry, companies can be subject to security issues in logistics such as cyberattacks, theft, fraud, terrorism, sabotage, and more. A 2018 Ponemon Institute report found that 56% of companies suffered a breach caused by one of their third-party vendors. Although breaches in a supply chain are common, many companies remain unprepared.\nWhy is supply chain security important?\nAttacks to the supply chain are twofold. The first is usually meant to disrupt or cripple actual supply chains logistics. The second is to use supply chains as a channel to attack potentially thousands of connected partners and suppliers. By finding and exploiting weak links within the supply chain, attackers can jump between linked systems, stealing data and sabotaging businesses.\nTech, defense, financial services, and energy are favorable targets for hackers, but no industry is immune. In fact, there are now what experts call “island hoppers” who aren’t just attacking one organization, but instead multiple.\nA security issue within the supply chain should be a high priority for companies considering any incident or breach could greatly damage or disrupt operations; vulnerabilities could lead to unintended costs, inefficient delivery schedules, and a loss of intellectual property.\nThreats to supply chain security are on the rise across all industries, with nearly two-thirds of companies reporting a breach—spiking 78% last year-over-year. The top threat: cyberattacks. In fact, a recent report found that 56% of respondents have experienced a cybersecurity breach from a third-party supplier. But risks can occur at all stages—design, development and production, distribution, acquisition and deployment, maintenance, and disposal.\nOnce an attack occurs and disrupts the supply chain, a company’s reputation can be damaged. From that point on, it can sow doubt into consumers’ minds about reliability, productivity, and their security, including financial and personal information.\nHow can companies protect themselves from security issues in logistics?\nCompanies must be proactive in developing defense protocols and standards for supply chains. To ensure your company supply chain is secure, the proper management and safety regulations need to be put in place. For the majority of organizations, poor risk management is often a result of resource scarcity and ineffective processes.\nAs most breaches are caused by third parties, third party risk assessments—along with an efficient vetting software for suppliers—can reduce the threat of security breaches in a supply chain. Organizations should identify and categorize suppliers who either have direct access to their internal network or access to critical enterprise data.\nSegregating third-party vendors according to their functional role can also help organizations better understand who these contributors are, the type of information they have access to, and how they are connected to the company framework.\nAdditionally, companies need to define specific data ownership requirements for every vendor. All the stakeholders across the value chain need to be clear as to who maintains the ownership of data being shared and the acceptable use of that data—doing so can greatly improve security issues in logistics."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:08a27c68-0dd9-4293-992b-f4e82c905629>","<urn:uuid:17e41b2a-b79c-4a5e-a244-7b4e4d21da41>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What territories did Venice control at the height of its expansion in the Eastern Mediterranean?","answer":"At the peak of its territorial expansion, Venice controlled all of the Eastern Mediterranean, including Corfu, Crete, and Cyprus. They briefly controlled Istanbul as well, though this control did not last long.","context":["My daughter is studying for a Master’s degree in Germany. She’s at the University of Marburg which has a long history in the subjects of philology and language. Lucy’s degree is in comparative German and French linguistics. She studies the development of language and how it changes over time, amongst other things. Recently she was assigned the book ‘Orientalism’ to read and consider. The book was written in the 1970s by Edward Said. It’s regarded as very important in explaining how ‘westerners’ developed a view of the ‘east’ from the Crusades onwards. A relationship that has always been one of distrust and fear.\nThis got me thinking about Venice, my favourite city on Earth and how Venice traded with the east from the 11th century onwards. Venice developed a way of trading with the ‘Orient’ in a way that respected their differences and tolerated any cultural confusions. These are casual notes to my daughter….\nHere’s what I said….\nThinking about ‘Orientalism’ and the Edward Said book, I came across the paintings of Gentile Bellini (Venice) 15th century. Bellini was from a painting family. His brother Giovanni (possibly more famous today than him) although at the time in the 15th century Gentile was the more esteemed of the two. He was sent by the Venetians on a diplomatic mission (to Istanbul) as part of a charm offensive to butter up the Turks (Ottomans). The reason for this was that the Venetians controlled many of the Eastern Mediterranean trade routes and it was very important that they had good access and good relations with Constantinople, Eastern Med, Alexandria (Egypt), Coastal Syria, Lebanon and of course (nearer to home) Greece and Dalmatian Coast (Croatia and Montenegro). When Bellini was in Constantinople he painted this portrait of Mehmet II (Ottoman leader) at that time. The first image is slightly colour-enhanced to show the richness of the frame and the opulence of the ‘treasure chest’ in the foreground.\nBellini also painted this amazing masterpiece below (so detailed and exceptional). You may have seen this when you went to the Accademia. Title: Miracle of the relics of the true cross at San Lorenzo (Venice) – 1500 – this painting has been recently restored. The lucidity of the water and the ghost like, ethereal characters (angels?) swimming in the water are almost magical in quality.\nGentile Bellini is credited with introducing ‘the oriental image’ into Venetian Art and narrative. For example – painting men in turbans, eastern clothing and featuring eastern architecture….\nEastern Architecture already existed in Venice – Basilica di San Marco is very oriental, with its multiple domes and intricate carved stone work and mosaic decorations – you could compare it with the Blue Mosque in Istanbul or The Church of Hagia Sofia – also Istanbul. Two more examples of works by Bellini with a decidedly Eastern flavour…………Firstly (below) this is St Mark (patron saint of Venice) preaching in Alexandria (during his life time – roughly contemporary with Jesus)………………..Although the painting is a medieval rendition of a Biblical subject. 1504-1507 (Brera Gallery, Milan)\nSecondly the painting of the Procession of the True Cross through Piazza San Marco – demonstrating the importance of Christianity at the heart of the Venetian Republic, whilst at the same time showing the mosque-like Basilica of San Marco in the background.\nGeneral point – the Venetians were instrumental in the Crusades and the fight by the morally superior (they believed) Westerners to reclaim the Holy Land from the Eastern Menace (Turks, Ottomans and other non-Christians). Much of the painting and art in Venetian churches was designed to reinforce the legitimacy of the Crusaders. There’s also an assumption here of an automatic right on behalf of Christians to seize all relics associated Christianity.\nIn the painting of St Mark preaching in Alexandria (Egypt) a large group of turbaned gentlemen are depicted on the right hand side of the painting. Whilst on the left the bishops and cardinals of the Christian church are shown. A selection of veiled ‘innocents’ are centre stage. I wonder if this mirrors the tradition in ‘Last Judgement’ scenes to present Paradise on the left of the image and Hell or Inferno on the right. A curious convention. What’s even more interesting is this effort through ‘narrative’ to refocus Christian history westwards to Italy – especially Rome (HQ of Roman Catholic Church) and Venice (Patron Saint St Mark) as legitimate trading partners with ‘the east’…….The more I think about this the more interesting it becomes.\nVenice at the height of her territorial expansion controlled all of the Eastern Mediterranean including Corfu, Crete and Cyprus. Venice briefly controlled Istanbul (although not for long) that was too much of a stretch.\nHistory is fascinating – through the study of history we learn about human behaviour, trade and territorial expansion.\nHappy Thinking! Have a great day Lulu,\nLove Mum xx\nSusan Rennie (Sue) commented on the Bellini painting ‘Miracle of the Relic of the True Cross at the Bridge of San Lorenzo’ (c. 1500) by artist Gentile Bellini – so here’s a little more information:\nThe picture is rich in detail and shows a procession day when the ‘relic of the true cross’ donated to the Venetians in 1369, accidentally falls into the canal. Immediately various people jump into the water to rescue this priceless relic. However the honour of retrieving the cross goes to the hero of the hour Andrea Vendramin who just happens to be from a very noble Venetian family and is also boss man of the Guild (Scuola) who had commissioned the painting in the first place. The lady on the left (front of painting in green velvet and gold) is thought to be Caterina Cornaro – Queen of Cyprus. Whilst the gents on the right are thought to be high ranking members of the guild and possibly a pair of Bellini brothers! The woman on the right of the painting, at the side of the canal appears to be ‘encouraging’ her Moorish slave to jump into the water to retrieve the cross.\nMiracle of the relic of the (true) cross at San Lorenzo – Gentile Bellini c. 1500 – Accademia Gallery, Venice"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8f1a7335-da12-46d4-b6f9-16277d272db1>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Why do both the 2013 Presidential Review Group and the 2021 Coast Guard strategy emphasize international partnerships in their security approaches?","answer":"Both emphasize international partnerships because of the global nature of modern security challenges. The President's Review Group notes that traditional foreign/domestic distinctions have blurred due to globally shared communications networks, requiring cooperative relationships with other nations while respecting their privacy interests and dignity. Similarly, the Coast Guard's strategy recognizes that addressing cyber threats requires working with foreign allies and international maritime industry partners to achieve unity of effort and ensure national security and economic stability.","context":["The President's Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies released this report on December 18, 2013. The document details forty-six recommendations for protecting national security and foreign policy interests while continuing to value privacy, civil liberties, and the public's trust.\n\"On August 27, 2013, the President announced the creation of the Review Group on Intelligence and Communications Technologies. The immediate backdrop for our work was a series of disclosures of classified information involving foreign intelligence collection by the National Security Agency. The disclosures revealed intercepted collections that occurred inside and outside of the United States and that included the communications of United States persons and legal permanent residents, as well as non-United States persons located outside the United States.\nAlthough these disclosures and the responses and concerns of many people in the United States and abroad have informed this Report, we have focused more broadly on the creation of sturdy foundations for the future, safeguarding (as our title suggests) liberty and security in a rapidly changing world.\nThose rapid changes include unprecedented advances in information and communications technologies; increased globalization of trade, investment, and information flows; and fluid national security threats against which the American public rightly expects its government to provide protection. With this larger context in mind, we have been mindful of significant recent changes in the environment in which intelligence collection takes place.\nFor example, traditional distinctions between \"foreign\" and \"domestic\" are far less clear today than in the past, now that the same communications devices, software, and networks are used globally by friends and foes alike. These changes, as well as changes in the nature of the threats we face, have implications for the right of privacy, our strategic relationships with other nations, and the levels of innovation and information-sharing that underpin key elements of the global economy. In addressing these issues, the United States must pursue multiple and often competing goals at home and abroad. In facing these challenges, the United States must take into account the full range of interests and values that it is pursuing, and it must communicate these goals to the American public and to key international audiences. These goals include:\nProtecting The Nation Against Threats to Our National Security.\nThe ability of the United States to combat threats from state rivals, terrorists, and weapons proliferators depends on the acquisition of foreign intelligence information from a broad range of sources and through a variety of methods. In an era increasingly dominated by technological advances in communications technologies, the United States must continue to collect signals intelligence globally in order to assure the safety of our citizens at home and abroad and to help protect the safety of our friends, our allies, and the many nations with whom we have cooperative relationships.\nPromoting Other National Security and Foreign Policy Interests.\nIntelligence is designed not only to protect against threats but also to safeguard a wide range of national security and foreign policy interests, including counterintelligence, counteracting the international elements of organized crime, and preventing drug trafficking, human trafficking, and mass atrocities.\nProtecting the Right to Privacy.\nThe right to privacy is essential to a free and self-governing society. The rise of modern technologies makes it all the more important that democratic nations respect people's fundamental right to privacy, which is a defining part of individual security and personal liberty.\nProtecting Democracy, Civil Liberties, and the Rule of Law.\nFree debate within the United States is essential to the long-term vitality of American democracy and helps bolster democracy globally. Excessive surveillance and unjustified secrecy can threaten civil liberties, public trust, and the core processes of democratic self-government. All parts of the government, including those that protect our national security, must be subject to the rule of law.\nPromoting Prosperity, Security, and Openness in a Networked World.\nThe United States must adopt and sustain policies that support technological innovation and collaboration both at home and abroad. Such policies are central to economic growth, which is promoted in turn by economic freedom and spurring entrepreneurship. For this reason, the United States must continue to establish and strengthen international norms of Internet freedom and security.\nProtecting Strategic Alliances.\nThe collection of intelligence must be undertaken in a way that preserves and strengthens our strategic relationships. We must be respectful of those relationships and of the leaders and citizens of other nations, especially those with whom we share interests, values, or both. The collection of intelligence should be undertaken in a way that recognizes the importance of cooperative relationships with other nations and that respects the legitimate privacy interests and the dignity of those outside our borders. The challenge of managing these often competing goals is daunting. But it is a challenge that the nation must meet if it is to live up to its promises to its citizens and to posterity.\"","#AceNewsReport – Aug.04: U.S. Coast Guard addresses threats to National Security in updated Cyber Strategic Outlook….\n#AceDailyNews reports that the U.S. Coast Guard addresses threats to National security in updated Cyber Strategic Outlook on Tuesday: The Coast Guard’s 2021 Cyber Strategic Outlook charts a path to meet the challenges of a rapidly evolving cyber domain where threats to information and operational technology systems outpace those from the traditional physical domains of air, sea, land and space.\nU.S. Coast Guard sent this bulletin at 08/03/2021 09:18 AM EDT News Release\nCyber-attacks against the United States are one of the most significant threats to economic and military power since World War II. The events of the last five years, including the exploitation of Coast Guard networks and information, the attacks on maritime critical infrastructure, and adversarial efforts to undermine democratic processes reinforce that cyberspace is a contested domain.\n“The Coast Guard is taking important and necessary steps to increase safety and security where physical and cyber threats converge,” saidAdm. Karl L. Schultz, commandant of the Coast Guard. “We maintain strong relationships with our U.S. port partners; we hold leadership roles on Area Maritime Security and Harbor Safety Committees; and we have the technological expertise to integrate cyber awareness and resilience within the Marine Transportation System.”\nThe 2021 Cyber Strategic Outlook is organized into three lines of effort that ensure the Coast Guard: (1) is mission ready in cyberspace, (2) protects the Marine Transportation System in cyberspace, (3) and identifies and combats adversaries throughout cyberspace.\nThese efforts will be underpinned by the development and sustainment of a skilled workforce, intelligence driven operations, and domestic and international partnerships to achieve unity of effort. Together, these ensure the Nation’s continued security and economic stability.\nWorking with partners in the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, other government agencies, foreign allies, and the maritime industry, the Coast Guard will defend our networks, protect the Marine Transportation System from threats delivered in and through cyberspace, and work to ensure those who would do our nation harm are held accountable.\nThe 2021 Cyber Strategic Outlook reaffirms the foundation that established cyberspace as an operational domain for the Coast Guard and brings the same ethos, proven doctrine and operational concepts, and over 230 years of experience to bear as we expand our operations in and through cyberspace.

{"question":"What are the chemical transformations that occur in dessert preparation, and what quality assurance standards must be met in food processing?","answer":"In dessert preparation, several chemical transformations occur, such as protein denaturation in eggs and chemical cross-linking during baking. A specific example is how sugar crystallization creates interesting effects, like in a toffee dessert that hardens and heats up when sucked, then cools down as it dissolves due to heat transfer principles. Regarding quality assurance, food processing must adhere to various standards including FPO, PFA, Agmark, ISI, and HACCP protocols. Food plant sanitation and cleaning in place (CIP) are also essential components of quality maintenance.","context":["© The Financial Times Ltd 2015 FT and 'Financial Times' are trademarks of The Financial Times Ltd.\nOctober 18, 2013 1:12 pm\nHow do you bake a cake? Most probably not the way Peter Barham does. If you beat your eggs, for example, rather than denature the protein to expose the hydrophilic molecules, or if you let the cake bake in the oven, rather than allow the egg protein to cross-link chemically, then you are a very different kind of baker to Barham.\nThis professor of physics at Bristol University has a zeal for understanding the science behind cookery processes. It’s an enthusiasm that began almost four decades ago, with a kitchen failure. In 1975 his wife gave him a cookbook after he finished his doctorate – with a PhD, logic suggests, you should be able to make an omelette. “I read the instructions and followed them, but nothing worked,” Barham says, still a little indignant. The only way he could improve his cooking, he concluded, was to “understand what [the cookery writers] actually meant you to do”.\nIf, unlike a published scientific experiment, a recipe couldn’t be reproduced with the same results as the original, it was, in Barham’s view, a failure, “fluffy stuff”. So he set about a surreally detailed analysis of the recipe for a Genoise sponge, translating it into rigorous scientific vocabulary. It attracted attention in his department, not least for the success that older colleagues had in baking their own sponges with his recipe at home.\nBut Barham was not the first physicist to become interested in food science. In 1969 Nicholas Kurti, professor of physics at Oxford, gave a Royal Society lecture on “The Physicist in the Kitchen”. Famously, he remarked, “I think it is a sad reflection on our civilisation that while we can and do measure the temperature in the atmosphere of Venus, we do not know what goes on inside our soufflés.”\nKurti’s cause was to bring science to the fore in the cook’s mind and to reorder the kitchen as a laboratory. There were so many possibilities for ingenuity and discovery in the medium of food. Kurti had proved it in the lecture theatre, injecting mince pies with rum through a hypodermic syringe, and tenderising a loin of pork by injecting it with fresh pineapple juice, which contains the proteolytic enzyme bromelin.\nThe influence of this culinary scientific principle today is everywhere – in restaurants, cookery books, and on television. And contrary to popular perception it was the scientists, the Kurtis of this world, not the Ferran Adriàs, who started the trend.\nIn the 1970s, Barham admits, “men were scientists, women were cooks”. The dynamic began to shift in the early 1980s, when a cookery teacher, Elizabeth Thomas, based in San Francisco, had an idea to bring scientists and chefs together. If Thomas had questions in her cooking she found her husband, a physicist, was able to “offer answers”. She suggested a seminar that would “get a group of people together to start understanding these things”, and invited Kurti to be its director. This became the International Workshop of Physical and Molecular Gastronomy, held in the Sicilian town of Erice during the 1990s, until it became “too big and popular” about a decade ago and was disbanded. (Kurti died in 1998.)\nThrough Barham’s participation in Erice and the food science circuit, one day in the late 1990s he got an unusual phone call back at the lab in Bristol. “You don’t know me,” said the caller. “I’m a chef, and I need your help.” It was Heston Blumenthal, and his “little problem” concerned green beans. Blumenthal’s Fat Duck restaurant had a tiny kitchen at the time, and he found that if he cooked green beans in salted boiling water, as the books instructed, “he could only cook six at a time, or the water came off the boil [when salt was added]”, Barham remembers. Blumenthal had experimented and found that neither salting nor boiling seemed to be essential – “you just had to get [the beans] hot, but he couldn’t find any literature anywhere to say if [that method] was right or wrong”. Barham affirmed that the salt made no difference, and the pair began to collaborate: “We went on from there”.\n. . .\nToday, Barham is not so much polymath as several people at once: expert on polymers, sometime adviser to Blumenthal, and visiting professor of molecular gastronomy at Copenhagen University. He is also besotted with the African penguin – he has just led the 8th International Penguin Conference in Bristol – and devotes much of his research to these birds.\nThe pressing culinary question for him now relates to the psychology of taste and flavour: to what extent does the complexity of food influence how much you like it? This is what he and colleagues in Copenhagen want to know. Other challenges have been conquered – Kurti’s soufflé question, for example, was solved 10 years ago. Faced with a problem, Barham says, “as a scientist I find it hard to believe there isn’t an answer.\n“Consider a simple dish, bacon and eggs, say – rashers and a fried egg. Suppose I want to make it more fun, I might mix them together to make a soufflé and have a variety of textures with the same ingredients. Or I might make an egg and bacon tortilla, or ice cream. But to define complexity is very difficult; all you can do is say one thing is more complex than another.”\nThe most important phenomenon, he argues, is that increasing complexity correlates with enjoyment only up to a point. “If you can modify the complexity of food in such a way that people really like it, but because it’s so complex find it more difficult to absorb it, they will eat less of it,” he says. “We’ve done a few trivial experiments to suggest there’s something there.” The simplest example is chocolate: “if you give people Dairy Milk they’ll eat 200g – a lot. But give them a Valrhona, and they might eat 20g or 30g. By altering the quality of food, can you alter the quantity people are consuming, without them even noticing? There’s potential there for things like obesity.”\nBack at home in Bristol, Barham’s wife’s original present has produced unexpected results. After a meal, Barham often serves a toffee-like dessert that comes out of the fridge cold and soft, but hardens and heats up as you suck it. “More fun still, as it melts away in your mouth, it gets cold.” Why? “Simple physics. If you take something that is a liquid and turn it into a solid, it has to give heat out. You start with a liquid sugar, and as you warm it up in your mouth it will start to crystallise, and becomes a solid. Now you dissolve that solid sugar crystal, and put heat back into it, so it takes heat away from your mouth and cools it back down.” Barham pauses, then confirms again: “Simple physics.”\nTo comment on this article, please email email@example.com\nCopyright The Financial Times Limited 2015.

{"question":"Which historic basketball achievement came first: the standardization of the 10-foot hoop height or Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game?","answer":"The 10-foot basketball hoop height was established first, dating back to James Naismith's invention of the game in 1891 when he nailed peach baskets at that height. Wilt Chamberlain's historic 100-point game occurred much later, on March 2, 1962, in a game between the Philadelphia Warriors and the New York Knicks at Hershey Sports Arena.","context":["- 1 What was the first basketball hoop made out of?\n- 2 How did James Naismith invent the game of basketball?\n- 3 Why is a basketball hoop 10 feet?\n- 4 How can you tell if a hoop is 10 feet?\n- 5 Why is the basketball rim orange?\n- 6 Are you allowed to dribble with 2 hands?\n- 7 What is the safest shot in basketball?\n- 8 What are the 13 original rules of basketball?\n- 9 What is the oldest sport?\n- 10 Can you dunk 5 10?\n- 11 Who was the shortest player in the NBA?\n- 12 Is NBA rim bigger than college?\n- 13 What is the height of NBA ring?\n- 14 How tall is a basketball ball?\n- 15 Are NBA hoops higher?\nWhat was the first basketball hoop made out of?\nBasketball was basically invented to keep students active during long chilly months. The first hoop consisted of a peach crate attached to a ten-foot-high railing and players aimed a ball into it.\nHow did James Naismith invent the game of basketball?\nNaismith called his new game “ basket ball ” and wrote up 13 rules. Two peach baskets and a soccer ball were the equipment. Naismith put the baskets at each end of the gym, nailed 10 feet above the floor. On December 21, 1891, the game of basketball was born in Springfield, Massachusetts.\nWhy is a basketball hoop 10 feet?\nThe reason the basket is 10 – feet high is because that’s how high the track above the gym was where Naismith invented the game and nailed peach baskets to it. Nothing more, nothing less. It’s one of the great historical stories of the game, of course, but that’s hardly a reason to keep it from changing.\nHow can you tell if a hoop is 10 feet?\nHave one person climb the ladder and place one end on the tape measure at the front tip of the rim so it is even with the TOP side of the rim. Drop the tape measure straight down to the playing surface to check the distance. The tape measure should read 10 feet for regulation basketball, typically ages 11 and older.\nWhy is the basketball rim orange?\nEveryone else knows nothing about this sport. According to wiki answers, its because “the man who coached the first basketball game wore an orange shirt to every game and when he passed away in his honor they colored the hoop orange “.\nAre you allowed to dribble with 2 hands?\nNothing in the rulebook that says a player cannot start a dribble with two hands. A dribble can end when touching both hands simultaneously, but a single dribble is OK as long as you catch the ball.\nWhat is the safest shot in basketball?\nSafest shot in general is the free throw. Shooting alone or in practice:\n- No pressure(s) or no real pressure.\n- Shoot at your own pace (no rush, no defense or low pressure defenses)\n- Do whatever you want before during and after each shot.\n- Get to pick and choose your shots.\nWhat are the 13 original rules of basketball?\nDr. James Naismith’s Original 13 Rules of Basketball\n- The ball may be thrown in any direction with one or both hands.\n- The ball may be batted in any direction with one or both hands (never with the fist).\n- A player cannot run with the ball.\n- The ball must be held in or between the hands; the arms or body must not be used for holding it.\nWhat is the oldest sport?\nThe oldest sport With the possible exception of athletics, wrestling is recognised as the world’s oldest competitive sport. Indeed cave drawings of wrestlers have been found dating as far back as 3000 BC. The sport was introduced into the ancient Olympics in 708 BC.\nCan you dunk 5 10?\nChallenging: 5 ′ 10 ″ – 6′ You ‘ll need to jump roughly 24 inches to touch the rim and 30 inches to dunk a full sized basketball (assuming average arm length). In this height range, very few people will be able to dunk without training their jump. However, with some training you will be able to dunk quite comfortably.\nWho was the shortest player in the NBA?\n|5 ft 3 in (1.60 m)||136 lb (62 kg)||Muggsy Bogues|\n|5 ft 5 in (1.65 m)||135 lb (61 kg)||Earl Boykins|\n|5 ft 6 in (1.68 m)||165 lb (75 kg)||Mel Hirsch|\n|5 ft 6 in (1.68 m)||133 lb (60 kg)||Spud Webb|\nIs NBA rim bigger than college?\nFor junior high, high school, NCAA, WNBA, NBA and FIBA, the rim is exactly 10 feet off the ground. Rims at every level of play are 18 inches in diameter. Backboards are also the same size at each of these levels. A regulation backboard measures 6 feet wide and 42 inches (3.5 feet) tall.\nWhat is the height of NBA ring?\nThroughout gyms, parks, and driveways around the world, basketball hoops are almost always 10 feet (3 meters) off the ground. Some leagues for young children play on shorter hoops, but from junior high schools through the professional leagues, the game is played on hoops of the standard 10-foot height.\nHow tall is a basketball ball?\nSize 7 (29.5″ or 75cm ) is the official size of all adult basketballs, suitable for male basketball players aged 13 years and over. The NBA Official Game Ball is a size 7 basketball and meets all size and weight specifications set by the NBA with a circumference of 29.5″ ( 75cm ).\nAre NBA hoops higher?\nOne of the greatest parts about basketball is that no matter where you’re watching a game — from an NBA arena to a college fieldhouse to a high school gym — the measurements are all largely the same. The hoop is the exact same height no matter where you travel.","Under personal life, it is this first sentence: wilt chamberlain was the first big earner of basketball: immediately becoming the highest paid player upon entering the nba, chamberlain was basketball's first player to earn more than $100,000 a year, and earned an unprecedented $15 million during his lakers years.

{"question":"How did the Marines' successful initial landing at Bougainville in November 1943 contribute to securing the beachhead, and what were the challenges faced during the subsequent Army expansion phase?","answer":"The Marines' initial landing on November 1, 1943 was successful despite heavy Japanese fire and difficult terrain conditions. The 3rd Marines, 9th Marines, and 2d Raider Regiment established a beachhead and by nightfall had landed 14,000 troops with 6,200 tons of supplies. The Marines gradually expanded the perimeter while fighting both the Japanese and challenging jungle terrain. They secured critical victories at battles like Piva Forks and Hellzapoppin Ridge, suffering 732 killed and 1,259 wounded before being relieved by Army units in December 1943. During the subsequent Army expansion phase under XIV Corps, the 37th and Americal Divisions faced a major Japanese counterattack in March 1944 when General Hyakutake launched the 'TA Operation' with 15,000 troops. Though the Japanese attacked fiercely from multiple directions, the Army units, supported by tanks, aircraft and naval gunfire, successfully repelled the assault, killing over 5,400 Japanese while losing only 263 men. The combined Marine-Army operations secured the vital Bougainville base that would help neutralize Japanese forces in the Southwest Pacific.","context":["The Bougainville campaign basically resembled that of Guadalcanal: it had a limited objective --- the capture and defense of a strategic airfield site. The acquisition of a base on Bougainville was part of the overall plan of isolating the highly strategic Japanese naval and air base of Rabaul on the island of New Britain. The initial landing on Bougainville was intended primarily as a Marine Corps operation. Once a beachhead was secured the Marines were to be withdrawn and replaced by Army troops.\nThe task of seizing the Cape Torokina region on the island was assigned to the I Marine Amphibious Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General Alexander A. Vandegrift and later by Major General Roy S. Geiger. For this operation IMAC included the -following assault units: 3d Marine Division, Major General Alan H. Turnage; 37th Infantry (Army) Division, Major General Robert S. Beightler; 2d Marine Raider Regiment (Provisional), Lieutenant Colonel Alan Shapley; 1st Marine Parachute Regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Robert H. Williams and 8th New Zealand Brigade Group, Brigadier R. A. Row.\nThe New Zealanders and one battalion of the parachutists were assigned special missions directly -related to the Bougainville operation, yet not connected with the actual landing. On 27 October 1943, four days before D-Day the brigade along with some U. S. elements made an assault on the enemy-held Treasury Islands, some 65 miles southeast of Empress Augusta Day. This had a dual purpose: to serve as a feint to distract the enemy from the main thrust and to neutralize a potential threat to the American lines of communication. The New Zealanders met considerable resistance in the difficult terrain but succeeded in securing the entire area by 12 November.\nAnother feint was made by the 2d Parachute Battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Victor H. Krulak, on the island of Choiseul on 27 October. The Marines stormed ashore destroying all enemy installations within reach. Believing that a much larger force had landed, the Japanese counterattacked but were repulsed with numerous losses. After seizing their limited objectives, the Marines withdrew to rejoin the main force that had landed on Bougainville having 'Lost only 11 men killed and 14 wounded. No other American forces returned to the island, as Choiseul became one of the many enemy-held island's left behind in the backwash of war.\nAt 0645 on 1 November 1943, the first wave of the assault force moved ashore on Bougainville. The initial landing was made by the 3d Marines, 9th Marines, and 2d Raider Regiment, less one battalion. Despite prior bombardment by both ships and planes, the invasion force met heavy fire from the defenders. Although this shore fire did not prevent the landing, it did cause much confusion. The situation was further complicated by a heavy surf. As a result, squads, platoons, even companies landed far out of position and in sectors assigned to other units. The dense jungle, moreover, did nothing to facilitate reorganization.\nBecause of the difficult terrain the beachhead was not expanded very rapidly. Three days after the landing the perimeter was only an average of 1,500 yards from the beach. Following the initial resistance the advance had been unopposed. The Marines now faced another enemy; the jungle and the swamps. Any advance inland was a matter of clawing, hacking, and wading one's way foot by foot.\nFrom the initial landing until the end of the Marine participation in the campaign, the story of Bougainville is one of a beachhead expanding slowly, inexorably against nature and the Japanese. Behind the perimeter engineers and Seabees struggled to construct air facilities on one of the most unpromising pieces of real estate in the entire Pacific.\nThe Japanese for the most part dug into the jungle and the ridges and waited for the Americans to carry the fight to them. Not until months after the Marines had left did they make a determined effort to oust the invader and by then it was too late. Only once did the Japanese attempt to throw out the Marines. During the night of 6/7 November, the enemy made an abortive counter landing at Atsinima Bay, some distance beyond the Marines, left flank, then anchored on the Koromokina River. In the meantime, the Japanese attempted an attack on the perimeter by infiltrating forces down the Piva Trail.\nThis two-pronged attack was ineffectual. The amphibious landing force was too small to really disrupt the American hold on the perimeter. More important, American naval and air forces thwarted any enemy attempt to send reinforcements to their beleaguered troops. Despite a determined resistance by the Japanese landing force (approximately 500 men, it was practically annihilated after three days of heavy fighting. The attack via the Piva Trail was also stymied after three days of heavy fighting. By 10 November, two battalions of the 9th Marines reached Piva Village and found that the Japanese had withdrawn. From then on the Japanese operated strictly on the defensive against the Marines and Army units which were gradually building up their strength on the island. The enemy 4 7 from his well-placed positions now began utilizing the tactics of counterattack, sniping, and infiltration, with an occasional Banzai charge to enliven proceeding. in country which gave the defenders every advantage, this made for some bitter and bloody fighting. The Japanese inability to commit sufficient troops for the task at hand, however, insured their ultimate failure.\nOne particular bloody engagement was the Battle of Piva Forks which began on 19 November and ended seven days later. This was a rather bitter and difficult battle in which units of the 3d Marines bore the brunt of the fighting. After engaging the Americans in very close combat, the Japanese broke off the fight, leaving behind more than 1,200 dead, and withdrew into the hinterland. There they set about the preparation of strong defensive positions beyond the range of American artillery. Clashes between Marine patrols and Japanese forces continued for some time. One such action merits special mention.\nThe last major battle for the Marines on Bougainville was the engagement at \"Hellzapoppin Ridge,\" where some of the toughest fighting of the campaign occurred. The Japanese were dug in on the steep slopes and crest of the ridge. After the discovery of the Japanese positions, it was found that the only way to dislodge the enemy was by a frontal assault. Between 12 and 18 December the Marines, primarily the 21st Marines, struggled to gain the ridge. Time and again they would get a foothold, only to be forced to abandoned it a little later. After a series of air strikes on the last day of the battle, the Marines were able to reach the crest. Over 200 of the defenders had died by the time struggle ended.\nToward the end of December Army units began replacing Marine Corps personnel and shortly after the first of the New Year most Marines were redeployed elsewhere. Their mission was completed; a precious beachhead had been secured on which American naval and air bases were rapidly being constructed. The price paid by the Marine Corps for the seizure of the Bougainville base sites was 732 killed and 1,259 wounded. The valor and courage displayed by the Marines demonstrated by the fact that three Marines received the Medal of Honor: Private First Class Henry Gurke, Sergeant Robert A. Owens, and Sergeant Herbert J. Thomas; all posthumously.\nFrom the advance bases on Bougainville, American forces disrupted the vital Japanese lines of sea and air communications in the Southwest Pacific. As a result thousands of Japanese troops were cut off from their sources of supplies. By early 1944, the enemy's offensive capability in this area of the Pacific had been effectively neutralized, thus enabling American forces to advance along the northern coast of New Guinea and into the Philippines. The seizure of potential base sites on Bougainville by the Marines had assured other American troops of easier going in the Pacific war.\nBougainville D-Day: Nov. 1, 1943\nAdmiral William F. Halsey, Commander South Pacific, ordered Task Force 39 (which included four cruisers and the eight destroyers of Captain Arleigh Burke's Destroyer Squadron 23), under Rear Admiral A.S. Merrill, to bombard airfields on Buka and Bonis northwest of Bougainville. He intended the bombardments to keep the enemy off-balance and prevent air harassment of the landing force. The task force then steamed more than 200 miles to strike at the Shortland Islands, while Rear Admiral F.C. Sherman's Task Force 38 took over the bombardment of Buka, eliminating the threat from those airfields.\nThe actual landing by the 3rd Marine Division at Empress Augusta Bay took place at dawn Nov. 1. The bay, located at some distance from the heavily defended airfields at either end of the island, had what appeared to be the most suitable beaches for a landing. The plan was to establish a beachhead, then bring in supplies and equipment to build a landing strip for fighters. Invasion forces consisted of 14,321 troops (including the 1st Marine Dog Platoon with their 24 Dobermans and German shepherds) in 12 transports, preceded by a minesweeper group. Destroyer Squadron 45, four minelayers and two salvage tugs provided further support.\nThe landing met with several obstacles. The Japanese defense of the beaches was stronger than anticipated. The 40,000 troops on the island had been reported stationed mainly around the airfields, and aerial reconnaissance photos did not reveal the extensive system of bunkers in the jungles above the beaches. The Marines who landed west of the mouth of the Koromokina River encountered steep slopes and shoals on which more than 80 of their amphibious craft foundered. Those landing east of the Koromokina were caught in crossfire from machine guns on the offshore islet of Puruata and on Cape Torokina east of the beach. A small contingent of Marines knocked out the gun emplacement on the cape after it had destroyed or damaged 14 landing craft; the 3d Marine Raiders captured Puruata.\nThe landing force drove away the rest of the Japanese defenders, while the dog platoon, moving ahead of the main body, sniffed out snipers along the trails of the bog-ridden jungle. In spite of the resistance, and two Japanese air assaults launched from Rabaul bases during the day (which were driven off by AirSols fighters), the Marines succeeded. By nightfall, all 14,000 troops, together with 6,200 tons of fuel, rations, and ammunition, were landed along a 200-yard perimeter.\nBattle of Empress Augusta Bay\nThe evening of the landing, Army reconnaissance aircraft reported that a large Japanese surface force was heading for Bougainville. Task Force 39 intercepted it about 2:30 the following morning 45 miles west of Empress Augusta Bay. The American ships, executing maneuvers at breakneck speeds in the darkness to avoid Japanese long-range torpedoes, sank two enemy ships after three hours of heavy fire. With two other ships damaged in collisions while trying to avoid American torpedoes, the scattered Japanese chose to retreat. The American force had only two ships hit, both of which sustained moderate damage.\nThe Japanese Response\nThe initial Japanese reaction to the Bougainville landing was to send a force of 19 ships to strengthen Rabaul. However, a Nov. 5 air attack from Task Force 38 heavily damaged seven cruisers and two destroyers, prompting the withdrawal of the cruisers and eliminating worries about surface attacks on the Bougainville amphibious forces.\nEven so, the night of Nov. 6-7, four Japanese destroyers eluded the Americans and landed 475 troops west of the Marine beachhead. The Japanese hoped to catch the Marines between them and the other troops on the island, but the enemy forces never coordinated their actions. The Marines routed out the counter-landing detachment after two days of artillery barrages.\nFewer than 100 Japanese escaped into the jungle; the rest were killed. The Marines sustained under 50 casualties. Another punishing attack from Task Force 38 on Rabaul Nov. 11 cost the Japanese 68 fighters and three ships. Nevertheless, Japanese carrier air groups from Rabaul made repeated attacks on the American landing force and the Navy ships, which continued to ferry in reinforcements, supplies and munitions.\nThe strikes did little damage to the American forces, but the Japanese lost so many planes--121 out of 173--that the remaining carrier-based squadrons were withdrawn Nov. 13.\nCourtesty Sandy Donellan","Tags: Guest Author, Solomon Islands Campaign Blog Project\nWe resume the quite comprehensive articles provided by CINCLAX as part of the ongoing Solomon Islands Campaign blog project. With the exception of some noteworthy battles at sea and on land, the Solomons campaign slogged on in near anonymity, except for those doing the fighting. We would learn much in the process – about joint operations, supporting forces ashore, the flexibility of carrier- and shore-based air, logistics and the like that would be applied in the coming campaigns through the Southwest and Central Pacific that would break the back of the Japanese military and lead the way to ending the war in the Pacific. That, however, lays still in the future. In the meantime, Bougainville continues…\nExpansion of the Torokina Beachhead\nThe first—or 3rd Marines—part of the Bougainville campaign had cost the Marines 423 killed and 1,418 wounded. Japanese dead were counted at 2,458; only 23 were taken prisoner. It had been a remarkably smooth operation.\nOn December 15, 1943 command of the Torokina beachhead Area had passed from IMAC (MG Roy Geiger) to XIV Corps (MG Oscar Griswold). Almost all of the 3rd Marines were withdrawn by the end of the month, and the Americal Division (MG John R. Hodge) and 37th Division (MG Robert Beightler) moved in to take their places. In fact elements of the 37th had already been in place, and initially Geiger had assigned them to the comparatively “peaceful” western part of the perimeter. Of the Marines, only the 3rd Defense Battalion would remain. Their 155mm guns would prove invaluable in defense of the perimeter.\nMeanwhile the airfields were being readied to reduce Rabaul and its environs. Since December 10th, F4U Corsairs of VMF 216 had been based on the new Torokina strip, and they would initially be the key to the successful AirSols bombing offensive against Rabaul. Before the Piva strips became operational on January 9th, Allied bombers would lift off from more distant fields and be joined by the Torokina fighters, so as bomber escorts they made feasible large-scale raids from elsewhere.\nDuring the initial period of the landings, air activity in support of the beachhead, consisted of daily flights over the Torokina area, in close air support (CAS), as well as regular strikes on southern Japanese bases like Kahili, Kieta, Kara and Ballale, and as visits to Buka and Bonis in the north.\nMeanwhile the Marines were perfecting their CAS techniques, and on ten occasions in November-December ground troops requested it. Each of these required that the strike be run within 500 yards or less from American front lines; three at 500 yards, three at 200 yards, one at 120 yards, one at 100 yards, and two at only 75 yards. Marine spotter aircraft used colored smoke to mark front line positions and white smoke to mark the target areas, setting up a solid liaison between air and ground units. Techniques developed here would form the doctrinal basis for later Marine campaigns.\nVery occasionally Japanese aircraft from Rabaul would score hits on command posts, supply dumps, ships, or small craft in Puruata Harbor (between Puruata Island and Cape Torokina), and on airfields which were under construction within the American perimeter. The net effect of these raids was minimal, and as enemy air strength diminished on Rabaul, raids dwindled to virtually nothing by the end of February 1944.\nIn time, most of AirSols assets would move to Bougainville, and it would become AirNorSols in June 1944.\nThe Americal Division was somewhat unusual in that it had never been given a number designation. In fact it was so-named because it had been formed up in May, 1942 in New Caledonia (representing the “Cal” part of the name). The Americal was also the first Army Division to take offensive action against the Japanese, and had fought with some with some distinction in the latter phases of the Guadalcanal campaign.\nLike many other early Army divisions, the Americal was formed from National Guard Regiments, in this case 132nd (Massachusetts), the 164th (North Dakota), and 182nd (Illinois).\nThe 37th, or “Buckeye Division,” also had National Guard roots—only from Ohio. It had originally been formed in Fiji, then moved to Guadalcanal for training in March 1943. Four battalions had assisted the initially hapless 43rd Division on New Georgia, and learned their trade the hard way in the attack on Munda. It was at Munda that XIV commander Griswold had “cut his teeth” as he straightened out the faltering Army effort.\nHyakutake’s Last Counterattack, March 9-17\nAfter his December failure to dislodge the Marines on and around Hellsapoppin’ Ridge, and now cut off from any significant supplies or reinforcements, one might assume that GEN Hyakutake would return to Buin and await a war outcome effected by people other than himself. But the old Guadalcanal veteran had lots of fight left in him.\nIn January and February 1944, the general’s men built or improved trails, so that the 17th Army could move from southern Bougainville to assembly areas in the hills inland from the XIV Corps’ perimeter. By mid-February the soldiers were on their way. Hyakutake planned to use the main strength of his 17th Army, which consisted principally of the 6th Division and several battalions of the 17th Division that Imamura had sent down from Rabaul in early November. The 6th Division was allegedly the toughest in the entire Japanese Army, and its commander, GEN Kanda Masatane, was a noted firebrand. Just before they attacked in March, he spoke to his men:\nWe must fight to the end to avenge the shame of our country’s humiliation on GUADALCANAL . . . . There can be no rest until our bastard foes are battered, and bowed in shame–till their . . . blood adds lustre . . . to the badge of the Sixth Division. Our battle cry will be heard afar. . .\nGriswold first knew something was afoot, as a reconnaissance in force of Fijian troops, under New Zealand command, went up the Numa Numa trail to see what they could find. A mile or so north of the XIV Corps perimeter, they were met by a strong Japanese force and had to quickly retreat.\nMaking the same mistakes twice\nTotal Japanese strength involved was about 15,000, while Hyakutake had underestimated his foe by nearly an entire combat division. In an interesting way, Japanese strategy was a repeat of their October 1942 offensive on Guadalcanal, and authored by the same man. Essentially it meant slogging through the jungle to circumnavigate the American perimeter and flank it at several points, while hopefully remaining undetected traveling over long jungle trails. Just as on the ‘Canal, the Americans on Bougainville enjoyed interior lines of communication, via a well-developed network of roads to sprint reinforcements to any threatened section of the perimeter. Meanwhile the flanking Japanese units had to make do with what they could carry through the jungle; if they needed additional troops, ammunition, food, medical supplies, etc., they were basically out of luck.\nBut unlike Guadalcanal, this time there would be no friendly IJN battleships and heavy cruisers arriving to support the Japanese attack; now all off-shore gunfire would be from American sources. There would be no more daily air raids from Rabaul or Kahili or the Shortlands, either. Now AirSols enjoyed overwhelming strength and air superiority, and was ready to respond with large-scale close air support.\nIn October 1942 Hyakutake’s attack failed miserably and was repulsed with heavy losses. His Bougainville efforts would reap similar results.\nAs they had tried before at Koromokina Lagoon in November, the Japanese had still hoped to launch an amphibious counter landing, coupled with an attack on the American perimeter inland. A shortage of Daihatsu landing barges made this very difficult, although it was not for lack of trying against increasingly strong LCI(G) and PT patrols. Nevertheless the Japanese had some success, and barges operating on moonless nights did manage to transport some heavy equipment, including artillery, to a point east of Cape Torokina from where it was laboriously hauled inland into the hills around the perimeter.\nMeanwhile, at the beginning of March 1944 XIV Corps’ perimeter was somewhat larger than it had been when Griswold took over from the 3rd Marines in December. The beach frontage had been pushed eastward a bit and now totaled about 11,000 yards, while maximum perimeter depth was about 8,000 yards, or just northeast of Hellsapoppin’ Ridge.\nGriswold’s main combat force was roughly split between Hodge’s Americal and Beightler’s 37th Divisions, totaling some 27,000 men, all veteran jungle fighters (Americal on Guadalcanal, 37th on New Georgia). All of Griswold’s combat regiments were placed on the perimeter and had had weeks to improve their defensive positions. Another 35,000 personnel, including AirSols, Marines and Navy, were attached to the XIV Corps. All these men had had at least a modicum of weapons training, and as events would show, had no fear of jumping into a battle. Indeed Griswold had previously taken measures to prevent “rear echelon” people from taking a rifle to the front lines “to get me a Jap.”\nHayakutake’s attack, dubbed the “TA” Operation, planned for three attack forces, largely acting independently. Named after their commanding generals, these were:\n- The Iwasa Unit – 2nd battalion of the 13th Infantry Regiment, the 23rd Infantry Regiment, plus two batteries of field artillery and supporting troops. These troops assembled behind Hill 1111 (see map above).\n- The Magata Unit – the 45th Infantry Regiment, plus some mortars and field artillery. They assembled at Mt. Nampei, on the Numa Numa Trail, the only cross-island path on Bougainville.\n- The Muda Unit – the rest of the 13th Infantry Regiment, plus engineers. This contingent assembled at Peko, a village on the East-West Trail\n- An artillery group commanded by COL Saito consisted of four 150mm howitzers, two 105mm howitzers and various smaller pieces. About 300 rounds per gun were allotted.\nHayakutake’s plan was to make two thrusts from the north on March 8th, then reorganize on the 9th and 10th and move on the Piva airstrips. Simultaneously the Muda Unit was to seize two hills then join with a battalion of the Iwasa Unit to attack Hill 608 from the southeast and northwest. After that, assuming everything went to schedule, on March 11th the Magata Unit was supposed to unite with the Iwasa Unit and capture the Piva strips. Then all Units were to drive to the sea and capture the Torokina fighter strip by March 17th. In typical Japanese fashion, it was an incredibly complex plan with little allowance for any local setbacks or flexibility to cope with American responses that might differ from expectations.\nIn short order, the Japanese attack was soundly defeated. Their artillery was quickly silenced by AirSols dive bombers and naval gunfire; then GEN Beightler sent in M-4 tanks (Shermans) when the enemy got inside the perimeter near the Piva strips. Helping out were Seabees and even medical personnel, who serviced aircraft under fire and occasionally rushed into the front line. On March 24th-25th Kanda’s 6th Division made its last attempt, at one point succeeding in getting within 25 yards of a battalion command post. But all for naught; on the 27th the Japanese were expelled from Hill 260, nearly one half mile outside the perimeter.\nAnd so the battle was over. The largest Japanese land attack in a year and a half was routed. Hayakutake lost 5469 KIA, Griswold 263.\nStill, it hadn’t been easy. Corps Commander Griswold, after eight major enemy attacks, wrote in a letter four days later:\nI am absolutely convinced that nowhere on earth does there exist a more determined will and offensive spirit in the attack than that the Japs exhibited here. They come in hard, walking on their own dead, usually on a front not to exceed 100 yards. They try to effect a break-through which they exploit like water running from a hose. When stopped, they dig in like termites and fight to the death. They crawl up even the most insignificant fold in the ground like ants. And they use all their weapons with spirit and boldness . . . . Difficult terrain or physical difficulties have no meaning for them.\nThe Japanese would make an additional series of half-hearted attempts, mostly by barge convoys from Buin. Again, CAPT “Scrappy” Kessing’s “Bougainville Navy” of LCI(G)s, PTs and destroyers shot up every small group of Japanese soldiers who got close to the shores of Empress Augusta Bay. Now for Hayatuke, the war was finally over. Marooned in southern Bougainville, out of food and supplies and with discipline rapidly declining, he was forced to assign most of his troops to growing vegetables in order to survive. In 1945 he suffered a stroke and was replaced by Kanda as CO of the 17th Army.\nIn retrospect Hyakutake’s plan was as unsound as his 1942 Guadalcanal attack. He spread out his forces and attacked in three places, whereas he would certainly have inflicted more damage on XIV Corps had he concentrated his forces and broken through the perimeter into the rear areas. With little artillery and absolutely no air support, the Japanese could not afford to delay any aspect of their attack, while American gunfire and CAS methodically eliminated pockets of Japanese resistance when their attacks stalled and they were forced onto the defensive.\n- The Pacific War Online Encyclopedia (http://pwencycl.kgbudge.com/) © 2006-2009 by Kent G.

{"question":"Compare the approaches to preventing organizational inefficiency in corporate versus project governance structures. What are the key differences?","answer":"In corporate governance, inefficiency is addressed through regular structure reviews that identify overlapping committees and unclear escalation paths, with specific focus on streamlining decision-making authority and ensuring meetings align with company culture and strategic priorities. Two approaches are used: detailed reviews of meeting materials and Terms of Reference for smaller organizations, and comprehensive governance reviews for larger organizations.\\n\\nIn project governance, inefficiency is prevented through simpler, more focused measures: implementing clear processes that are easy to understand, ensuring governance reflects how the organization actually works, and focusing on appropriate resource deployment. The emphasis is on reducing wasted time and effort through controlled idea development and testing, while maintaining a balance between innovation and practical implementation.","context":["How to Avoid a Scandal: Prioritising Quality Governance\n“Poor governance and controls” are still being flagged by the FCA as key drivers in causing consumer harm. But given there are several governance regulations in place aiming to prevent this, such as the Corporate Governance Code, the UK Stewardship Code, and the Wates Principles; why is consumer harm still occurring?\nConsumer harm is still occurring as many firms adopt mindsets which focus on handling the immediate problem rather than fixing its underlying causes. This was explored in our recent blog on Purposeful Cultures. This short-term mindset is also seen in how firms respond to governance regulation.\nA new reporting requirement in the Companies Act (Section 172) means that large companies must include a separate governance statement in their Annual Report. This statement must detail how the company complied to section 172 of the Companies Act, which requires directors to promote the long-term success of the company for all its stakeholders not just its shareholders. Despite stakeholder consideration and long-term decision making being crucial for the longevity of a firm, too many firms viewed the requirement as a short-term box-ticking exercise. Often, organisations were looking for examples of where decision making did consider stakeholders and long-term impacts rather than challenging the many meetings where this did not occur. The former approach typifies focusing on the immediate regulatory problem, at the expense of the underlying risk of consumer harm.\nFirms can only be confident that good governance is taking place, and that regulatory expectations are being met, by focusing on the overall quality of governance, rather than the granularity of compliance to regulation.\nOrganisations should focus on the following three keys areas to drive a higher standard of governance overall and reduce the likelihood of consumer harm: stakeholder engagement, good-quality meeting materials, and regular governance structure reviews.\n1. Stakeholder engagement\nOrganisations must identify their stakeholders to ensure there is an engagement model in place which captures potential stakeholder impacts. This is the backbone of good-quality stakeholder engagement and without this, good governance cannot take place. Some firms may already have engagement programmes in place, but less established firms must take action to identify key relationships and highlight dependencies between different parts of the business and different stakeholders. This should then be used to identify the most appropriate engagement channels to ensure frequent, meaningful and in-depth engagement with all company stakeholders.\nOnce a good quality engagement model is in place, the outputs must be leveraged in the boardroom and other governance for a to ensure informed decision making. This can only be achieved through devoting time and materials to stakeholder considerations across every step of the governance process, from agenda planning to high-quality meeting minutes. It is crucial that organisations ensure enough meeting time is allocated to decision items to allow for full and challenging discussion, as true collective agreement is harder to reach when rushed. Shorter agendas with more time allocated for each item should be prioritised, rather than having “busier” agendas with less time for challenge and debate.\n2. Good-quality meeting materials and debate\nGood-quality governance is built on high-quality meeting papers, and appropriate debate and discussion. These can both be improved by prioritising the following two areas:\na. High-quality meeting papers are crucial as if meetings are not getting the correct information or where matters are omitted, it is impossible to have good governance. Papers must be of sufficient quality to allow meeting members to engage and drive the challenge and debate needed. It is through challenge and debate that the value of a governance meeting can be realised, as the discussion allows the skills and experiences of meeting members to be leveraged thus ensuring the best decision is reached. This is also why it’s important to have a diverse group of members on senior governance meetings to prevent “group think” and the likelihood of poor decision making.\nb. Recurring questions relating to a company’s purpose, stakeholder implications, and long-term effects of a decision. Standard questions must occur in every paper which focus on how a decision affects the company and its stakeholders in both the short and long term. Responses should be supported by metrics which reflect the implications and potential results of a decision in the long term, rather than focusing on the immediate “good news” results.\nAny changes to the governance approach must be accompanied by specific training for all governance participants including paper authors who do not attend the meeting. This is to ensure genuine understanding of the importance of stakeholder consideration, long-term impacts and how they are crucial to a company’s purpose and longevity.\n3. Governance structure reviews\nInefficient governance is a common problem for firms, with new committees being set up as the firm grows, changes priorities or responds to regulatory rulings. But this growth of meetings prevents good governance rather than encourages it, as overlapping committees and unclear escalation paths prevent good decision-making and drain management time.\nOrganisations must regularly challenge its governance structures and approach to ensure they are fit for purpose. This can be done in several ways. Firstly, through in-depth reviews of both meeting materials and Terms of Reference to assess an organisation’s governance structure. This review must identify any overlaps or gaps in decision-making authority, the effectiveness of escalation paths, and whether meetings are operating in line with a firm’s culture, strategic and regulatory priorities.\nThis approach is best suited to smaller organisations and is unsuitable for large organisations as the scope will be too narrow and it will not identify duplicative or inefficient meetings. In these cases, a different type of governance review should be used, where firms identify all meetings taking place before analysing against requirements and streamlining where required. This approach is particularly useful for global organisations working across geographies and regions with multiple business lines.\nTo reap the full benefits, a governance structure review covering both approaches should take place regularly, at least once every two years.\nGovernance quality is key\nIn order to reduce the risk of consumer harm, firms must focus on their overall governance quality rather than finding examples of regulatory compliance. Through focussing on three key items: stakeholder engagement, good quality of meeting materials, and regular governance reviews, firms can improve the overall quality of their governance and thereby improve decision making and reduce the likelihood of consumer harm.\nBCS has helped a wide variety of firms build high-quality governance structures and practices. We are experienced in all areas of governance including material reviews, governance effectiveness assessments, and governance design analysis and improvement.\n https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/correspondence/general-insurance-portfolio-letter.pdf 4 September 2020","Four vital principles for project and programme governance\n- Stakeholder management\nOctober 3, 2017 |\n3 min read\n- Stakeholder management\nThe focus of many organizations, particularly in the public sector, is how to reduce the cost of operations or to maintain the existing level of service at a lower cost base.\nManaging a programme of work to identify, develop and deliver projects focused on improving the cost base – or generating cash savings – can be particularly challenging when it comes to engaging stakeholders and using management information and insight to drive the right behaviours. An example of this is a typical Cost Improvement Programme (CIP) within an NHS Provider Organization that can have upwards of 200+ projects or initiatives to deliver reductions in the organization’s overall cost base.\nWith the pressure to meet financial targets, identify and deliver cost saving initiatives as early as possible, it is easy to omit appropriate governance. Without the governance in place, people don’t understand roles and responsibilities and the process for generating ideas and dedicating resources to progress them is not managed. Failing to progress new ideas into phases of development, delivery and – ultimately realization – is wasted time and effort, while the chances of success are severely impacted.\nAppropriate, well-designed governance ensures that only ideas and initiatives suitable for further investigation receive the resource to develop them further. Deploying resources in a more controlled manner enables an organization to balance the number of hypothetical, sometimes far-fetched ideas, generated, whilst also encouraging innovative approaches. Testing these types of ideas – using appropriate governance arrangements – demonstrates that organizations can gain more value from driving the right behaviours and should develop only genuine ideas to deliver cash-releasing savings.\nWhat does good governance look like?\nEffective governance arrangements are developed upon the following principles:\n- The processes and procedures are simple and easy to understand and are communicated and shared with all relevant stakeholders\n- They are designed to meet the needs of the organization and reflect how the organization works – taking into account other programmes in a wider portfolio of work and effort\n- The governance facilitates an appropriate level of challenge\n- The ability to manage risks within given parameters with a clear route to escalation as required.\nThe benefits of introducing appropriate governance arrangements within programmes are:\n- Increased clarity of the roles and responsibilities of project and programme resources and wider stakeholders\n- Improvement in the overall value of ideas delivered and realized\n- Increased programme control and reduced leakage (wasted time and effort)\n- Improved visibility of the overall programme value and the value of projects at each stage of development – enabling the Senior Responsible Owner (SRO) to make effective decisions\n- Improved return on investment with resources deployed in the most appropriate way; doing the right things and aligned to the programme vision\n- Increased sustainability of programme if requirements for each stage in the project lifecycle are well-understood and communicated.\nAn environment of appropriate governance arrangements provides a level of management and control to reach a particular end point and achieve success. This means deploying resources in the most appropriate way, managing accurate and timely data, insight, benefits realization and the delivery of outcomes.\nGovernance needs to create the right behaviours, encourage innovation whilst introducing an element of control and escalation. Implementing appropriate project and programme governance arrangements may feel like a time consuming exercise. However senior stakeholders should recognize and appreciate that the effort applied to this exercise will provide a much larger return during the delivery of benefits and increase the overall chance of successful delivery."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f003b654-7941-4025-ad4f-be04d7bbc4d4>","<urn:uuid:79195c04-0e59-4e7f-97be-59dc63aeef11>"],"error":null}
{"question":"¿Qué características estructurales y ventajas constructivas hacen que los truss bridges sean suitable for accelerated bridge projects, y cuáles son los main challenges in implementing such rapid construction methods?","answer":"Truss bridges offer several structural and constructive advantages that make them suitable for accelerated projects: they are relatively lightweight yet strong due to their triangular design, can be built in various locations including difficult terrain, and use materials efficiently. They can also accommodate road placement on top of the span, making them versatile for installation. However, implementing rapid construction methods faces significant challenges: ABC requires ample space for project staging and laydown, demands close coordination with multiple stakeholders (as seen in the Boston projects with MBTA and CSX), and truss bridges specifically require professional expertise for construction. Additionally, their complex maintenance requirements and space-consuming nature can complicate accelerated implementation.","context":["How a rising tactic in bridge design and construction is bringing welcome relief to drivers and communities alike\nThere’s a necessary evil in our work upgrading bridge infrastructure—managing traffic and vehicle congestion. Bridge construction can force commuters into frustratingly long detours, block homeowners from convenient access to their homes, and, at worst, even impact emergency services.\nThis congestion can be especially maddening for drivers who are regularly navigating through a job site that has encroached upon the road or highway by restricting lanes for what seems to be a slow-moving construction project, oftentimes for highly complex and necessary infrastructure upgrades like bridge replacements. In my years overseeing the design and construction of bridges and roadways throughout New England, particularly along the bustling expressways in Greater Boston, balancing a project timeline while minimizing impact on local traffic patterns has always been a highly complicated endeavor.\nLuckily, in recent years there’s been some relief with new methods and tactics designed to help mitigate the downtime of roadways and highways during construction.\nThe River Street Bridge project in Boston involved the replacement of a busy multi-modal crossing for pedestrians, daily vehicle traffic, and a bus route, which was also located above a railroad.\nThe ABCs of accelerated bridge construction\nLike many states across the US, Massachusetts state officials have embraced a new approach. In 2008, the Massachusetts Legislature established Accelerated Bridge Program legislation to launch this concept with the goal of reducing the number of structurally deficient bridges in the state system and (arguably most importantly) doing this work in a way that causes the least amount of disruption to the traveling public.\nBy using prefabricated/precast bridge elements or constructing as much of the new bridge as possible off-site and then installing the new bridge in place of the old, accelerated bridge construction (ABC) can speed replacement or rehabilitation of workhorse bridges to reduce mobility impacts and user costs. Benefits of this practice include faster delivery time, improved work-zone safety for the traveling public and project crews, minimized traffic impacts, and a shortened window of disruption to the local community in terms of noise, detours, and traffic. With about one-quarter of the nation's 600,000 bridges needing rehabilitation, repair, or replacement, ABC can serve as a valuable tool.\nABC can come with its own unique challenges—namely the need for ample space for project staging and laydown. However, I’ve found that these techniques can be especially valuable in densely populated, congested areas where minimal disruptions to traffic and transit are vital, including bicyclist and pedestrian traffic.\n_q_tweetable:With about one-quarter of the nation's 600,000 bridges needing rehabilitation, repair, or replacement, accelerated bridge construction can serve as a valuable tool._q_\nManaging multi-modal needs\nOur team at Stantec has been at the forefront of utilizing ABC in New England, and we’ve had great success employing ABC in areas like Boston, where the needs of local drivers, pedestrians, and public transit must be considered. Most recently, we designed two bridge replacements in Boston’s thriving Dorchester neighborhood that both illustrate how effective collaboration and planning can help minimize disruptions to the local community.\nThe River Street Bridge and Morton Street Bridge replacements posed a unique challenge, with both projects occurring on a bus route, as well as over a railroad used by the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) and CSX freight railroad. As a result, construction phasing required close coordination with MBTA’s commuter rail operators, CSX freight operators, and bus route operators to detour traffic while also maintaining vehicular and pedestrian access to all local streets and businesses.\nThrough proactive collaboration and construction planning, each bridge was replaced in a 55-hour window, only impacting vehicular and rail traffic for two separate weekends.\nPreserving accessibility in a city’s center\nOur team also developed plans for the rehabilitation of Massachusetts Avenue bridge over Commonwealth Avenue in the heart of Boston’s bustling Back Bay neighborhood. This work was essential to improving the condition of the bridge—originally built in 1937—and enhancing safety conditions. In this case, a conventional replacement would require up to three years for construction, resulting in ongoing disruptions to Massachusetts Avenue as well as Commonwealth Avenue crossing underneath.\nAccelerated bridge construction helped ensure limited disruption during the rehabilitation of Boston’s Massachusetts Avenue over Commonwealth Avenue, which sees an average of 22,000 daily drivers.\nAs a key artery in Boston with a 22,000 average daily traffic estimate, the team was challenged with maintaining traffic (for vehicles, buses, bicyclists, and pedestrians) and utilities during construction. As a result, we utilized ABC to ensure accessible traffic lanes on Massachusetts Avenue and limited public disruption. A unique aspect to this project involved the relocation of all utilities away from the bridge before demolition and replacement could occur. Once complete, work was accomplished over Mother’s Day weekend, with the contractor ultimately being able to open Massachusetts Avenue to traffic one day ahead of schedule.\nWhile the concept of ABC is easy—build a bridge off-site in the biggest pieces possible to allow you to assemble it on-site in the shortest amount of time—the condensed timeframe requires a very experienced engineered approach to coordinating all pieces in a temporary bridge closure. Done well, this results in satisfied drivers, rail commuters, bicyclists, and walkers, who experience minimal disruptions to their daily lives.\nAbout the AuthorMore Content by Walter Heller","A Truss bridge is a type of bridge whose main element is a truss, which is a structure of connected elements that form triangular units. Truss bridges are among the oldest types of bridges that are found all over the world and are still regarded as state-of-the-art technology.\nA truss is formed by many different beams that come together to form triangles to support the bridge’s way. Trusses are used to support and stabilize the bridge. A truss is a very rigid structure, and it transfers the load from a single point to a much wider area. It helps to handle compression, tension, and weight of the different types of loads.\nThe reason why the shape (truss) is so useful for building bridges is the fact that when it is placed under stress, the tension or compression created makes the structure stronger. This process makes it possible to support dynamic loads under variable conditions.\nThe key benefit of using a truss bridge to span a distance is that they are relatively lightweight, but can still be reinforced to provide strength. Because of the triangular design, each part of the bridge helps to support other parts, making it an effective design.\nThe basic types of truss bridges are simple in design. The traditions of truss bridges originated from the early 19th century. Truss bridges are considered to be one of the oldest types of bridges and are economic to construct because they use materials efficiently.\nWhile it is very strong and has tremendous load capabilities, there are also several drawbacks associated with the truss bridge design. Let’s take a deep look at the pros and cons associated with truss bridges.\nTable of Contents\n- Pros of Truss Bridge\n- Cons of Truss Bridge\nPros of Truss Bridge\n1. High Strength\nTruss bridges are characterized by their interconnecting triangular structures, which give them the strength to withstand more heavy and dynamic loads. It gives the ability to carry heavy traffic loads, making it ideal for dense population areas and railroad crossings.\nTruss Bridge is a reliable type because of its ability to withstand the weight of heavy loads of the cars and trucks that use it to get to and from a destination.\n2. Ease of Construction\nMore popularity of truss bridge over other types is their versatility to be constructed in places where construction could be difficult, such as locations needing a long span of areas like deep trenches.\nEngineers prefer building truss bridges because these structures have the flexibility to be built in different locations with different depths and width. Moreover, they can be built with ease in between mountains and even over railways.\n3. Uses Materials Effectively\nWhile the truss bridge has many linked parts to make up its structure—its use of materials is extremely effective. Because of its design, it makes good use of limited construction materials to achieve strength that far outweighs its cost. Materials such as wood, iron, and steel are all utilized to their highest potential, hence reduces building cost.\n4. Affordable Design Option\nCompared to other bridge designs truss bridge designs often require fewer materials to complete the structure. Minimal amounts of materials needed to build a truss bridge and each piece is used very efficiently. This makes it possible to save on design and implementation costs, while also reducing the labor needs of the structure.\n5. No Span Restrictions\nOne of the most appealing properties of a truss bridge is that it can be built over very long as well as very short distances. Many truss bridges tend to be small, spanning small distances within transportation networks. Engineers can install this type of bridge almost anywhere in the world today because of the efficiency of its design.\n6. Road is Placed on the Top of the Span\nThe truss bridge is one of the only types of bridges that allow for the road to be placed on top of it, rather than built into it. With a truss bridge, the transportation surface is placed on top of the support structures.\nThat makes it easier to integrate existing construction principles into the bridge while minimizing traffic delays. That’s why truss bridges can be built off-site, then installed once the pieces are delivered. This makes the truss bridge both versatile and economical to build.\nCons of Truss Bridge\n1. A Lot of Maintenance is Required\nA truss bridge, like any load-bearing structure, will require regular and detailed maintenance. Truss bridges may provide high levels of support, but the additional components and connections of the bridge mean it requires high levels of maintenance as well.\nEvery inch of the structure plays a significant role in how the span performs. There are several additional connections and components in this design that create a higher risk of failure at some point.\n2. Space Consuming\nPerhaps one of the drawbacks of building truss bridges is the amount of space it can eat up by the infrastructure. The interconnecting triangular components need to be large in order to bear and distribute heavy loads.\nThe structure of a truss bridge is large by design, hence can take up quite a bit of space. This means that in certain places, the truss bridge may not be the best option or might need adjustment of existing structures in order to accommodate these bridges.\n3. Requires Professional to Built\nA truss bridge might seem like a simple design, but it can be quite complex. Each and every piece needs to fit perfectly to perform its function, and anything less will mean that the bridge simply does not hold a load. A truss bridge requires detailed engineering and specialist construction—this does not come cheap.\n4. Heavy Weight\nBecause truss bridges are so large and use a lot of materials, hence the overall weight of the structure can be very heavy. Depending on the landscape supporting the bridge, some reinforcement may be necessary to cope with the weight. If the landscape can’t support a truss bridge then there may be other bridge options such as suspension or beam bridges, which might be more suitable.\n5. Have a Lower Weight Tolerance\nTruss bridges were first built with lightweight vehicles in mind. Although they can handle appropriate levels of traffic, there are some designs that cannot support certain heavy-duty vehicles. On older truss bridges, some drivers must pay attention to the maximum weight rating to prevent damaging the structure.\n6. High Cost\nWhile it is said that truss bridge design efficiently uses materials, it does use a lot of them. Professionals are required to design the structure of the bridge, which aids up its building cost. Building a truss bridge can be more complicated and expensive, thus it can be a huge drawback for a community that is having a tight maintenance budget."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c1ad4a02-d63c-4af8-af90-3513a0cd1484>","<urn:uuid:955c384e-77ce-4c09-93f1-fc210e4c0cc2>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between how property is distributed when someone dies intestate in Oklahoma versus Nevada, particularly regarding the spouse's inheritance rights?","answer":"In Oklahoma, a surviving spouse inherits the entire estate if there are no children, deceased parents, and no surviving siblings. If parents/siblings survive, the spouse gets jointly owned property plus one-third of the remaining estate. In Nevada, for separate property without a will, the surviving spouse receives one-third of the separate property, with remaining assets split among children. In both states, if children survive, they receive shares of the estate - in Oklahoma the spouse gets half and children split the other half, while in Nevada children receive equal shares of two-thirds of the separate property.","context":["A will is an important document if a person knows whom he wants to inherit his property upon his death, especially if those beneficiaries are not relatives. When a person dies without a will, the law sets forth who inherits his property, and it is distributed by law with no exceptions. In Oklahoma, inheritance laws set forth requirements for a will and how property will pass if there is no will.\nDying Without a Will\nA person dies \"intestate\" when he dies without a will. Under Oklahoma law, a surviving spouse is entitled to inherit the entire estate if the decedent did not have any children, his parents are deceased and there are no surviving siblings. If the decedent is also survived by parents or siblings, the spouse inherits any property owned jointly with the decedent and one-third of the remaining estate. The balance passes to the parents, but if they are deceased, the siblings will inherit equal shares. If the decedent had children, the spouse inherits half of the estate and the children inherit equal shares of the other half. If the spouse is deceased, the law states that the children will share the entire estate. When the decedent is not survived by any heirs, the law permits the state to \"escheat,\" where the property passs to the state of Oklahoma.\nVideo of the Day\nDying With a Will\nIf a person does not want her property to pass according to the intestacy statute, she must make a will. In Oklahoma, a testator (one who makes a will) must be at least 18 years old. She must have full mental capacity (\"of sound mind\") and be making the will voluntarily. A will must be in writing (typed). Handwritten (\"holographic\") wills and oral (\"nuncupative\") wills are permitted in very limited circumstances, such as military service or deathbed declarations, but requirements are strict, so typed wills are best. The testator must sign her will in front of two witnesses, who must also sign the document in the testator's presence. A will is valid unless it is revoked, so it should be updated to reflect changes in a testator's life, including marriage, divorce, birth of a child or purchase and sale of property. A testator can update her will by signing a \"codicil\" with the necessary amendments, or she can revoke the will in its entirety by destroying it or by signing a new will.\nA testator can leave his property to anyone he wants, including friends and charities. However, Oklahoma law does not permit a testator to disinherit his spouse. If a surviving spouse is left out of a will, she may request her \"elective share\" from the court. This action must be taken when a will is submitted for probate. If she fails to contest the will, she will not be entitled to inherit. However, if her request is timely, the surviving spouse will inherit her intestate share after all expenses and debts are paid, before anyone else is entitled to inherit under the will.\nProperty That Cannot Be Willed\nA decedent cannot include his entire estate in his will. Certain property already has an intended beneficiary and is not willable. For example, any property owned jointly, including real estate and bank accounts, is owned with a right of survivorship. The surviving owner automatically inherits the decedent's share. If any property is held in trust, it will also pass to the beneficiary automatically upon death. Lastly, life insurance policies have named beneficiaries. The insurance company will disburse the proceeds to the named beneficiary upon receipt of a death certificate. Inheritance of non-willable property is automatic and the decedent is not permitted to alter named beneficiaries in his will. Any such provisions are invalid, and a court will not recognize them during probate.","In my last installment (Who Is Qualified to Serve as Administrator of an Estate?), I wrote about Boris and Natasha and the Big Fight occasioned by Boris dying without a will. As you may recall, Boris had two adult children from a prior marriage when he married Natasha. He and Natasha had two children before Boris died without a will. His property was substantial and all of it was acquired prior to his marriage. What happened to the property on his death?\nThe good news is that no one was disinherited, and the property did not escheat to the state. Nevada law provides for property to go to your closest relatives if you die without any estate planning in place. In a community property state such as Nevada, a married person’s property may be either community or separate, or some combination of the two. Separate property is property acquired before marriage, as well as property acquired by gift or inheritance during marriage. All property earned during marriage, or purchased with earnings during marriage, is community property. These characterizations can be changed by a written agreement if the couple wishes.\nFor Boris and Natasha, all of Boris’s property was separate property and he left no will. Nevada law provides that in such case, the surviving spouse is entitled to one third of the separate property, and—because he had more than one surviving child—the children were entitled to equal shares of the remaining two-thirds. Boris did not put any of his assets into joint tenancy with Natasha, but if he had, Natasha would have succeeded to such assets. Once the estate administration finished, Natasha received one-third of Boris’s assets; the couple’s minor children received one-third subject to a guardianship or trust until they became adults; and Boris’s two adult children received the remaining one-third in equal shares.\nHow you hold title to an asset affects how it can be disposed of during lifetime and how it will be distributed upon your death. Title to property affects inheritance taxes and the extent to which probate may be needed.\nCommunity Property. Nevada is a community property state. Property acquired during marriage by the labor of either or both spouses is deemed “community property” and each spouse has an equal interest therein. It is possible to acquire or hold property as “community property” or as “community property with right of survivorship.” The additional language “with right of survivorship” ensures that the surviving spouse will receive title to the whole of the asset upon the death of the first spouse. Holding an asset as community property also creates a tax advantage, in that the surviving spouse will get a step up in basis on the asset to the date of death of the first spouse. In other words, the surviving spouse will not have to pay a capital gains tax on the increase in value from the date of purchase to the date of the first spouse’s death.\nSeparate Property. A married person may also hold property as his or her separate property. This includes property that was acquired prior to marriage, or property acquired during marriage by one spouse only as a gift or an inheritance. A spouse with separate property may make a gift of that property to the community by deeding or changing title of the asset to community property. If the spouse continues to hold the property as separate, upon death the spouse may will it to anyone he wishes; the surviving spouse does not have any legal right to it. However, if a spouse with separate property dies without a will, separate property will pass according to Nevada’s laws on intestate succession, and the surviving spouse will be entitled to a share of the property.\nJoint Tenancy. Two persons, whether or not married, may hold property as joint tenants. Upon the death of one joint tenant, the surviving joint tenant becomes the owner of the whole of the property. In other words, the heirs of the first joint tenant to die do not inherit that person’s interest in the property; it passes by operation of law to the surviving joint tenant.

{"question":"How genetic drives help fight mosquito diseases?","answer":"Gene drives, based on CRISPR technology, are designed to suppress mosquito-borne diseases like malaria, dengue, zika, chikungunya, yellow fever and West Nile. They work in two ways: they can either immunize mosquitoes against disease parasites (such as malaria), or act as genetic insecticides that reduce mosquito populations.","context":["Two active genetic strategies are helping to address concerns about the release of gene engines in the wild.\nOver the last decade, researchers have created a number of new tools that control the balance of genetic inheritance. Based on CRISPR technology, such gene devices are poised to move from the lab to the wild, where they are designed to suppress devastating diseases such as mosquito-borne malaria, dengue, zika, chikungunya, yellow fever and West Nile. Gene drives have the power to immunize mosquitoes against malaria parasites or to act as genetic insecticides that reduce mosquito populations.\nAlthough the latest gene devices have been shown to propagate efficiently as designed in the laboratory, concerns have been expressed about the safety of placing such systems in wild populations. Questions have been raised about the predictability and controllability of gene devices and whether, once released, they can be called into the field if they spread beyond the intended region of application.\nNow researchers at the University of California, San Diego, and their colleagues have developed two new active genetic systems that address such risks by stopping or eliminating genetic devices in the wild. On September 18, 2020 in the magazine Molecular cell, research led by Xiang-Ru Xu, Emily Bulger and Valentino Ganz of the Department of Biological Sciences, offers two new solutions based on elements developed in the common fruit fly.\n“One way to mitigate perceived risks from genetic drives is to develop approaches to stop their spread or erase them if necessary,” said respected professor Ethan Bier, senior research author and research director at the Institute of Genetics. and the Tata Society “There was great concern that there were so many unknowns about genetic devices. We are now saturated with opportunities, both genetically and at the molecular level, and we have developed mitigating elements. “\nThe first neutralization system, called e-CHACR (hitchhiking constructions by autocatalytic chain reaction), was designed to stop the spread of a genetic device by “shooting it with its own pistol.” e-CHACRs use the CR9PR enzyme Cas9 carried on a gene device to copy while mutating and inactivating the Cas9 gene. Xu says e-CHACR can be placed anywhere in the genome.\n“Without a source of Cas9, it is inherited like any other normal gene,” Xu said. “However, once e-CHACR confronts a gene device, it deactivates the gene device in its tracks and continues to spread for several generations,” chasing “the drive element until its function is lost by the population.”\nThe second neutralization system, called ERACR (Element Reversing the Autocatalytic Chain Reaction), is designed to completely remove the gene device. ERACRs are designed to be inserted at the site of the gene device where they use Cas9 from the gene device to attack both sides of Cas9 by cutting it out. After the gene device is deleted, the ERACR is copied and the gene device replaced.\n“If ERACR is also given an advantage by carrying a functional copy of a gene that is disrupted by the genetic device, then it is competing across the finish line, completely eliminating the genetic device with a fixed solution,” Bier said.\nResearchers rigorously tested and analyzed e-CHACR and ERACR, as well as their results DNA sequences, with detailed details at the molecular level. Bier estimates that the research team, which includes mathematical modelers from UC Berkeley, has spent about 15 years working hard to comprehensively develop and analyze the new systems. However, he warns that there are unforeseen scenarios that may arise, and neutralization systems should not be used with a false sense of security for gene devices implemented on site.\n“Such braking elements simply need to be developed and kept in reserve in case they are needed, as it is not known whether some of the rare exclusive interactions between these elements and the gene drives for which they are intended may have unforeseen activities,” he said.\nAccording to Bulger, genetic devices have a huge potential to alleviate suffering, but their responsible deployment depends on the availability of control mechanisms in the event of unforeseen consequences. ERACRs and eCHACRs offer ways to stop the spread of the gene device and, in the case of ERACRs, can potentially return the engineered DNA sequence to a state much closer to the natural sequence.\n“Because ERACR and e-CHACR do not have their own source of Cas9, they will only spread to the gene disk itself and will not edit the wild-type population,” Bulger said. “These technologies are not perfect, but we now have a much more comprehensive understanding of why and how inadvertent results affect their function, and we believe they have the potential to be powerful mechanisms for controlling gene drive if the need arises.”\nReference: “Active Genetically Neutralizing Elements for Stopping or Deleting Gene Devices” by Xiang-Ru Shannon Xu, Emily Bulger, Valentino Gantz, Carissa Klanseck, Stephanie Heimler, Ankush Auradkar, Jared Bennett, Lauren Ashley Miller, Sarah Leahy, Sara Sanz Jus , Anna Buchman, Omar Akbari, John M.

{"question":"What are the ricochet angles for different ammunition types in World of Tanks?","answer":"Different ammunition types have specific angles at which they ricochet: Armor-Piercing (AP) and Armor-Piercing Composite-Rigid (APCR) shells ricochet at 70 degrees, High-Explosive Anti-Tank (HEAT) shells ricochet at 85 degrees, and High-Explosive (HE) and High-Explosive Squash Head (HESH) shells ricochet at 90 degrees. These angles are important for determining whether a shell will bounce off armor at steep angles.","context":["World of Tanks - Overmatch, Normalization, and Ricochet Guide\nLearn what the Game Mechanics, overmatch, normalization, and richochet mean, and how they work in World of Tanks.\nWorld of Tanks is home to many Battle Mechanics, affecting how the game works and how your tanks play. Most of them you’re almost definitely not familiar with, and many of those you don’t need to be familiar with, but there are some that provide knowledgeable players an advantage over those who haven’t done their homework.\nIn this article we’ll be looking at three of the latter, the Overmatch, Normalization, and Ricochet mechanics, which all go hand-in-hand and are used in every battle whether you realise it or not.\nNormalization and Ricochet Angles\nIn World of Tanks we use the ‘normal’ or cosine angle as a starting reference when determining impact angle. In Layman’s terms, when the shell hits a flush, unangled surface absolutely perpendicular to it then the angle is 0 degrees. The impact angle is calculated based on the deviation from this normal, where 10 degrees is a very shallow angle, 65 degrees is a far greater angle, and 90 degrees would be parallel to the armor plate you’re firing at. An increased angle will mean greater effective armor or perhaps even automatic ricochet, thus if you’re trying to penetrate a target you want your shot to be as close to the normal as possible.\nNormalization refers to the angle reduction applied based on the type of ammunition you fire - you can see the different types listed below. It’s also worth noting the angle at which each type of shell begins to ricochet for later reference.\n- Armor-Piercing (AP): 5° Normalization, Ricochets at 70°\n- Armor-Piercing Composite-Rigid (APCR): 2° Normalization, Ricochets at 70°\n- High-Explosive (HE) and High-Explosive Squash Head (HESH): 0° Normalization, Ricochets at 90°\n- High-Explosive Anti-Tank (HEAT): 0° Normalization, Ricochets at 85°\nWhat this translates to is differing Effective Armor (EA) values based on ammunition type. If an AP round is fired at a 100mm thick surface angled at 60 degrees, the effective angle would instead be 55 degrees as you subtract the base Normalization value of AP from the standard 60 degree angle, resulting in 174mm Effective Armor. Do the same with APCR and you’re facing 189mm EA. Again, for HE variants like HEAT, you receive no shell Normalization, resulting in the full 200mm EA.\nThis is very useful to keep in mind when deciding on which round to fire at the enemy, or when comparing tanks to their competitors. The 121 Tier 10 Chinese Medium Tank may seem like it has mediocre penetration at 258mm, but when you consider the EA reduction it receives against practically anything it fires at (considering it has AP standard rounds) compared to every other Tier 10 Medium Tank which each fire APCR, it has effectively the greatest penetration value of them all.\nAlternatively, the Kanonenjagdpanzer Tier 8 German Premium Tank Destroyer has 238mm of AP penetration on its standard ammunition, but 250mm penetration HEAT rounds. Considering the Normalization of the AP rounds there’s almost never a situation in which you should ever fire the Premium HEAT, which is certainly an odd decision on Wargaming’s part considering the credit price of the Premium ammunition is over 11 times greater than its Standard counterpart.\nHere’s where things can get complicated, hence the plethora of misconceptions surrounding this mechanic, but bear with me. Overmatch once again revolves around the concept of making tanks easier to punch holes in, but is based on shell calibre and only applies to Armor-Piercing shell variants like AP or APCR – HEAT, for example, cannot Overmatch because the calculation is based on Normalization values, and as previously established only AP variants have a Normalization value. Overmatch is split into two sections, Double and Triple Overmatch;\nDouble Overmatch occurs when your shell calibre is greater than (not simply equal to) the enemy’s nominal armor thickness, i.e. their plate thickness without taking into considering any angling, for example a 122mm AP shell hitting a 60mm plate. When this occurs the following calculation takes place:\nbasic normalization * 1.4 * shell caliber / nominal armor thickness\nTo put this into a scenario we can understand, let’s theorize that there’s a Panther slightly angling his turret side away from your IS’s 122mm D-25T main armament at a 69 degree angle, or more accurately a 64 degree angle after your AP round’s 5 degrees of normalization is reduced.\nThe Panther’s effective armor value would only be 137mm anyway which wouldn’t be sufficient enough to stop your 175mm average shell penetration most of the time. However, accounting for the 25% shell penetration RNG that is present in this game, you could potentially minimum roll for 131mm of penetration instead, which would actually not penetrate the Panther’s soft armor. Because you Double Overmatched, however, the effective angle would be reduced further than a mere 5 degrees according to the formula above:\n(5 * 1.4 * 122) / 50 = 17.08\nRather than 5 degrees being taken off the original 69 degree angle, 17.08 degrees would be shaved off instead, resulting in a 51.92 degree effective angle and just over 97mm Effective Armor, completely removing the chance of ricocheting.\nAdmittedly, Double Overmatch isn’t too useful by itself considering high calibre guns capable of Double Overmatching usually have a high enough base penetration value to penetrate practically every time anyway, but it’s nice to eliminate the small amount of RNG present in specific cases nonetheless.\nTriple Overmatch really doesn’t add too much more in the way of mechanics, but it enables all of Overmatch’s potential by introducing one minor factor – if the Shell Calibre is triple that of the Nominal Armor thickness, a ricochet is no longer possible (and the calculation for Double Overmatch is carried out).\nIn the aforementioned scenario, if the Panther aimed its turret face directly at the IS, then the IS would ricochet its angled turret side due to the angle exceeding 70 degrees (which, as previously mentioned, is the angle at which AP variants begin to ricochet). Were an FV215b (183) or FV 4005 to meet a Panther (perhaps the Tier 8 Premium variant the Panther mit 8.8cm L/71), however, they would not ricochet. Their 183mm AP rounds exceed triple the nominal armor thickness of the Panther’s turret sides, and considering the sheer penetration value of 310mm, they cannot roll low enough to not penetrate the effective armor value even at 89 degrees pre-calculation, making a non-penetration absolutely impossible.\nIt is important to recognise the difference between “non-penetration” and “ricochet”, however. While, indeed, a ricochet is impossible when a Triple Overmatch occurs, it’s entirely possible (while uncommon) to not be able to penetrate the effective armor thickness post-calculation if your penetration value is significantly low.\nThis is uncommon because, as previously mentioned, higher calibre guns at higher Tiers typically have a high penetration nature which far exceeds any sort of effective armor value a thin plate may have post-calculation. But, there are cases of low penetration Howitzers at lower tiers - capable of firing AP - simply not having sufficient penetration to penetrate the reduced Effective Armor value despite Triple Overmatching them, as shown in this Hetzer vs IS-4 and Object 140 gif below.\nDue to the height of the IS-4 compared to the Hetzer, the roof angle reached around 87 degrees or above meaning, despite the Hetzer using 105mm AP rounds against the IS-4’s 30mm turret roof, the Effective Angle post-calculation was around 62.5 or higher, resulting in over 65mm Effective Armor (greater than the Hetzer’s 64mm average AP penetration).\nThat one bounced! Abprallen!\nAs mentioned in the Normalization section, various ammunition types have differing degrees at which they ricochet. What strategic relevance does this have?\nWell, for AP it’s obvious after you read the Overmatch section – 70 degrees can be very limiting when it comes to opening up weakspots on your enemies, hence Overmatch can be so very useful. For rounds that cannot Overmatch, however, having a higher ricochet angle can prove to be very useful, especially for HEAT rounds which typically have significantly higher penetration values than their AP and APCR counterparts.\nWhat this translates to is you’re still able to take advantage of certain weak spots, such as turret roofs, through sheer penetration value and lack of care for ricochet angles up to 85 degrees (such as the IS-3, Obj 140, and IS-4’s roofs), while also being able to open up new weaknesses entirely unavailable to all AP variants due to the limitations of Overmatch.\nAs can be seen, the E 50 M’s turret sides are angled at just shy of 74 degrees with a nominal thickness of 80mm. Because there are no AP rounds above 183mm in calibre, let alone over the 240mm calibre necessary, it’s impossible to Triple Overmatch the E 50 M’s turret sides. At such an angle, however, they only have 300mm Effective armor thickness, making them penetrable by most Tier 9 and 10 HEAT rounds, such as those found on the T110E5 with 340mm of penetration. You can also take advantage of many side scraping tanks which cannot be overmatched, but are angled below 85 degrees (as is often the case) – just watch out for tracks and spaced armor.\nSo, go wreak havoc on those poor, unsuspecting Tiger 2’s in your IS-3 while being called a cheater for daring to read up on how the game works.

{"question":"How do prophecies typically function as plot devices in fantasy literature, and why are they rarely proven false?","answer":"In fantasy literature, prophecies typically function as self-fulfilling plot devices. Ironically, the very efforts taken to prevent a prophecy often end up causing it to come true, which drives the story forward. It's extremely rare for prophecies in fantasy to be simply false, though their true meaning often only becomes clear in hindsight. While prophecies may appear straightforward, they can be undermined by subtle quibbles or interpretations.","context":["Fantasy tropes and conventions\nMany works of fantasy operate with these tropes, while others use them in a revisionist manner, making the tropes over for various reasons including; for comic effect, to create something fresh (a method that often generates new clichés), and objections to the effects of old tropes.\nGood vs. evil\nThe conflict of good against evil is a theme in the most popular forms of fantasy, such as high fantasy; normally, evil characters erupt from their lands to invade and disrupt the good characters' lands. J. R. R. Tolkien delved into the nature of good and evil in The Lord of the Rings, but many of his imitators use the conflict as a plot device and often do not distinguish the sides by their actual behavior. In some works, mostly notably in sword and sorcery, evil is not opposed by the unambiguously good but by the morally unreliable.\nThe Damsel in Distress\nHeroic characters are a mainstay of fantasy, particularly high fantasy and sword and sorcery. Such characters are capable of more than ordinary behavior, physically or morally, or both. While they may at first be less than the role required, they grow into it. This may take the form of maturation which is often through Coming of Age.\nMany protagonists are, unknown even to themselves, of royal blood. Even in so fanciful a tale as Through the Looking-Glass, Alice is made a queen in the end; this can serve as a symbolic recognition of the inner worth of the hero. Commonly, these tales revolve around the maltreated hero coming into his or her own. This can reflect a wish-fulfillment dream or symbolically embody a profound transformation.\n||It has been suggested that Dark Lord (fiction) be merged into this article. (Discuss) Proposed since April 2013.|\nThe forces of evil are often personified in a \"Dark Lord\". He (or she) is often depicted as a diabolical villain. The effects of his or her rule often assert malign effects on the land as well as its subjects, as in the case of Jadis the White Witch, who keeps the land of Narnia enchanted in perpetual Winter in The Chronicles of Narnia. Besides usual magical abilities, the Dark Lord often controls great armies and can be portrayed as possessing devil-like qualities. A Dark Lord is usually depicted as the ultimate personification of evil, often committing atrocities that make common people afraid to speak their very names, as with Sauron of The Lord of the Rings; Conan the Barbarian's archenemy Thulsa Doom; the Dark One (Shai'tan) of The Wheel of Time; and Lord Voldemort of Harry Potter.\nOther notable Dark Lords include the Sith Lords from Star Wars, which include Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine; Darkseid from DC Comics; Dracula of the Castlevania series; Skeletor from Masters of the Universe; Brona the Warlock Lord from The Sword of Shannara; Morgoth from The Silmarillion; Arawn Death-Lord from The Chronicles of Prydain; Torak from The Belgariad; Nightmare from Soulcalibur; the Lich King from the Warcraft franchise; Ganon from The Legend of Zelda; Exdeath from Final Fantasy V, Zamorak, Lord Drakan and several of the mahjarrat from RuneScape and Galbatorix from The Inheritance Cycle. The villain of the Demon Sword video game is also literally called 'Dark Lord'.\nThe protagonists of the Overlord video game franchise are classic Dark Lords in the vein of Sauron. The Dark Lord is usually seen as unmarried, though there has been occasion when one has attempted to claim a beautiful maiden as his bride.\nQuests, an immemorial trope in literature, are a common trope in fantasy. They can run from a quest to locate the plot coupons necessary to save the world, to an internal quest of self-realization.\nIn a fantasy, magic is often overwhelming in presence — although its precise nature is delineated in the book in which it appears. It can appear in a fantasy world, or in a fantasy land that is part of reality but insulated from the mundane lands, or as a hidden element in real life.\nA common trope is that the ability to work magic is innate and rare. As a consequence the person who uses it, usually called a magician, wizard, sorcerer, warlock, mage, magus, or various other titles, is a common figure in fantasy. Another feature is the magic item, which can endow characters with magical abilities that are not innate, or enhance the abilities of the innately powerful. Among the most common are magic swords and magic rings.\nSelf-fulfilling prophecies are amongst the most common forms of magic because they are an often used plot device. Often the very effort undertaken to avert them brings them about, thus driving the story. It is very rare for a prophecy in a fantasy to be simply false, although usually their significance is clear only with hindsight. Quibbles can undermine the clearest appearing prophecies.\nIn The Lord of the Rings trilogy, J. R. R. Tolkien minimized use of the word magic; beings who use such abilities tend to be confused when they are described this way by others. In the Star Wars franchise, the Jedi employ the use of the Force, an essentially magical power that grants mystical abilities and heightened senses and skills to whomsoever wields it.\nMany creatures seen in fantasy fiction are drawn from the folklore of Europe and the romances of medieval Europe. Dragons and unicorns are among the most popular creatures. Other monsters, such as griffins, giants, and goblins also appear. Races of intelligent beings such as elves and dwarves often draw their history from medieval or pre-Christian roots. Characteristics of the hero and heroine also frequently draw on these sources as well.\nPerhaps even more important is setting. Writers from the beginnings of the fantasy genre, such as William Morris in The Well at the World's End and Lord Dunsany in The King of Elfland's Daughter, set their tales in fantasy worlds clearly derived from medieval sources; though often filtered through later views. J. R. R. Tolkien set the type even more clearly for high fantasy which is normally based in such a \"pseudo-medieval\" setting. Other fantasy writers have emulated him, and role-playing and computer games have also taken up this tradition.\nThe full width and breadth of the medieval era is seldom drawn upon. Governments, for instance, tend to be feudalistic evil empires or oligarchies, and are usually corrupt, despite the greater variety of the actual Middle Ages. Settings also tend to be medieval in economy, with many fantasy worlds disproportionately pastoral.\nThese settings are typical of epic fantasy and, to a lesser extent, of sword and sorcery — which contains more urban settings — than of fantasy in general; the preponderance of epic fantasy in the genre has made them fantasy commonplaces. They are less typical of contemporary fantasy, especially urban fantasy.\n|This section does not cite any references or sources. (June 2013)|\nA less common inspiration is the ancient world. A famous example is the Hyborian Age (the fictional world of Conan the Barbarian), which features analogues of Ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Roman Empire, among others. Two notable recent series with such settings are Bartimaeus by Jonathan Stroud, Camp Half-Blood and The Heroes of Olympus by Rick Riordan, although they are both largely set in modern day.\nMany fantasy stories and worlds refer to their main sapient humanoid species as \"races\" rather than species. The usage of the term in this context was popularized by J. R. R. Tolkien and was further adapted and spread by the use of races in Dungeons & Dragons role-playing games. Many fantasy settings use the terms \"race\" and \"species\" interchangeably, such as the World of Warcraft video game.\nIn role-playing games, \"race\" typically refers to any species that can be used as a player character. In older editions of Dungeons & Dragons, the primary non-human player races (dwarf, elf, gnome, halfling, and half-elf) were called \"demi-humans\". Later games such as Shadowrun use the term \"metahuman\", and define these humanoid races as subdivisions of Homo sapiens.\nOther races include Orcs, which were popularized in Lord of The Rings by J. R. R. Tolkien. They are now used in many fantasy worlds and are often depicted as large, green brutish creatures with more muscle than brains (although Tolkien's Orcs, while savage, are cunning and probably as intelligent as a man).\nOther races include various humanoid creatures that appear like animals like wolves, bears, boars and other animal species.\n- John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, \"Revisionist Fantasy\", p. 810 ISBN 0-312-19869-8\n- John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, \"Good and Evil\", p. 422 ISBN 0-312-19869-8\n- John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, \"Evil\", p. 323 ISBN 0-312-19869-8\n- John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, \"Heroes and Heroines\", p. 464 ISBN 0-312-19869-8\n- John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, \"Brave Little Tailor\", p. 136 ISBN 0-312-19869-8\n- John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, \"Ugly Duckling\", p. 972 ISBN 0-312-19869-8\n- Stephen Prickett, Victorian Fantasy pp. 145-6 ISBN 0-253-17461-9\n- John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, \"Hidden Monarch\", p. 466 ISBN 0-312-19869-8\n- John Grant and John Clute, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy, \"Dark Lord\", p. 250 ISBN 0-312-19869-8\n- \"The Darklords of Helgedad\".

{"question":"比較 Kappa Andromedae b 和 Pleiades cluster 的距離 from Earth (light years)?","answer":"Kappa Andromedae b is located 170 light years away from Earth, while the Pleiades cluster, which contains Alcyone, is located at a much greater distance of approximately 440 light years from Earth.","context":["A ‘super-Jupiter’, an exoplanet similar to Jupiter but much more massive has been discovered orbiting the massive star Kappa Andromedae. This is one of the rare times that an exoplanet has been observed directly, in this case aided by its enormous size and relatively close proximity.\nThe planet has a mass at least 13 times greater than that of Jupiter, and follows an orbit quite a ways out from the Sun, similar to Neptune’s. Located only 170 light years away in the constellation Andromeda, the star that it orbits is visible from the Earth with the naked eye. At two and a half times the size of the Sun, this star is also the largest star to “host a directly observed planet” yet seen.\n“Our team identified a faint object located very close to Kappa Andromedae in January that looks much like other young, massive directly imaged planets but does not look like a star,” said Thayne Currie, a post-doctoral fellow in the Department of Astronomy & Astrophysics at the University of Toronto and coauthor of a paper titled “Direct imaging of a `super-Jupiter’ around a massive star” to be published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters. “It’s likely a directly imaged planet.”\nThe discovery was made during an infrared imaging search that was done as part of the Strategic Explorations of Exoplanets and Disks with Subaru (SEEDS) program, using the Subaru telescope located in Hawaii.\n“Kappa Andromedae moves fast across the sky so it will appear to change position relative to more distant, background objects,” Currie says. “When we reobserved it in July at multiple wavelengths, we saw the faint object again, located at about the same position as it was in January. This indicates that it is bound to the star and not an unrelated background object.”\nThe planet has been named Kappa And b, and is very likely the first direct rendering of an exoplanet in over two years, and it’s also the first new exoplanet system in almost four years.\nIn the one image that we currently have, the faint point of light seen in infrared that is Kappa And b is “completely lost amid the overwhelming glare of the host star. The SEEDS observing team was able to distinguish the object’s faint light using a technique known as angular differential imaging, which combines a time-series of individual images in a manner that allows for the otherwise overwhelming glare of the host star to be removed from the final, combined image.”\n“Young planets retain significant heat from their formation, enhancing the brightness at infrared wavelengths. This makes young star systems attractive targets for direct imaging planet searches. However, despite this fact, the successful direct imaging of extrasolar planets is exceptionally rare, especially for orbital separations akin to our own solar system planets. The extraordinary differences in brightness between a star and a planet are a primary reason why only a handful of planets have ever been directly imaged around stars.”\n“Although astronomers have found over 750 planets around other stars, we actually directly detect light from the atmosphere of only a few of them,” said Currie. “There are approximately six now. Kappa And b is one of them if our estimates for its age and mass are correct, which we think they are. The rest are only inferred directly.”\nThe massiveness of the super-Jupiter and the host star is in sharp contrast to our own solar system. “Observers and theorists have argued recently that large stars like Kappa Andromedae are likely to have large planets, perhaps following a simple scaled-up model of our own solar system. But experts predict that there is a limit to such extrapolations; if a star is too massive, its powerful radiation may disrupt the normal planet formation process that would otherwise occur. The discovery of the super-Jupiter around Kappa Andromedae demonstrates that stars as large as 2.5 solar masses are still fully capable of producing planets within their primordial circumstellar disks.”\n“This planetary system is very different from our own,” Currie says. “The star is much more massive than our Sun and Kappa And b is at least 10 times more massive than any planet in the solar system. And, Kappa And b is located further from the star than any of the solar system planets are from the Sun. Because it is generally much harder to form massive planets at large distances from the parent star, Kappa And b could really be a challenge for our theories about how planets form.”\n“The SEEDS research team continues to study the Kappa And b emitted light across a broad wavelength range, in order to better understand the atmospheric chemistry of the gas giant, and constrain the orbital characteristics. The researchers also continue to explore the system for possible secondary planets, which may have influenced the Kappa And b formation and orbital evolution. These follow-up studies will yield further clues to the formation of the super-Jupiter, and planet formation in general around massive stars.\nSource: University of Toronto\nImage Credits: NAOJ/Subaru/J.

Wiessinger","Alcyone, Eta Tauri (η Tau) is a multiple star system located in the constellation Taurus, the Bull. With an apparent magnitude of 2.87, Alcyone is the third brightest star in Taurus, after Aldebaran and Elnath, and the brightest star in the Pleiades cluster (Messier 45), one of the nearest open clusters to Earth. The star lies at an approximate distance of 440 light years from Earth.\nEta Tauri is listed as a multiple star system in the Washington Double Star Catalog (WDS) and the Catalog of Components of Double and Multiple Stars (CCDM). The latter catalog lists the primary component, formally named Alcyone, and three companions. Alcyone B (24 Tauri) is a white (A0) main sequence star with an apparent magnitude of 6.28, located at a separation of 117’’ from the primary component. Alcyone C has the variable star designation V647 Tauri and is classified as a Delta Scuti variable. Its brightness varies from magnitude 8.25 to 8.30 with a period of 1.13 hours. Alcyone D is a white (F3) main sequence star with a visual magnitude of 9.15.\nThe Washington Double Star Catalog lists Alcyone D as a double star with two similar components separated by only 0.3’’. The catalog lists four other fainter stars in the system, none of them brighter than magnitude 11.\nThe primary component in the system is a triple star. The brightest component is a bluish (class B7IIIe) giant star with a mass between 5.9 and 6.1 solar masses and a radius about 9.3 times that of the Sun. With an effective temperature of 12,258 K, the star is 2,030 times more luminous than the Sun, but most of its output is in the invisible ultraviolet part of the spectrum. Alcyone is a Be star and, like all the named Pleiades except Maia, it is a very fast spinner, with a projected rotational velocity of 149 km/s. As a result, it is surrounded by a disk of gas ejected around the equator.\nThe nearest companion is a low-mass star separated by less than 1 milliarcsecond from the primary. The two components orbit each other with a period of a little over four days. The other companion is located at a separation of 0.031 arcseconds (roughly the distance from the Sun to Jupiter). It is half as massive as the primary. The two have an orbital period of about 830 days.\nAlcyone is the brightest member of the Pleiades open cluster. The nine brightest stars in the cluster are named after the Pleiades, the Seven Sisters in Greek mythology – Alcyone (Eta Tauri), Asterope (21 Tauri), Celaeno (16 Tauri), Electra (17 Tauri), Maia (20 Tauri), Merope (23 Tauri) and Taygeta (19 Tauri) – and their parents Atlas (27 Tauri) and Pleione (28 Tauri).\nThe Pleiades open cluster contains more than 1,000 confirmed members and has a total mass of 800 solar masses. The brightest members are hot blue stars of the spectral type B with an estimated age of up to 100 million years. They lie at an average distance of 444 light years from Earth.\nCatalogued as Messier 45 by the French astronomer and comet hunter Charles Messier, the cluster is exceptionally bright and large, occupying an area of 110 arcminutes. It has an apparent magnitude of 1.6 and is the most recognizable star cluster visible to the naked eye. Up to 14 members are visible without binoculars in exceptionally good conditions, but observers normally see six to eight stars.\nThe members will likely keep travelling together through space for another 250 million years and then gradually disperse as a result of gravitational interaction with the interstellar medium.\nIn Greek mythology, the Pleiades caught the eye of Orion, the hunter. After their father Atlas was condemned to carry the heavens on his shoulders, Orion began to pursue the sisters. Zeus intervened, transforming the sisters first into doves and later into stars. The constellation Orion still appears to be pursuing the Pleiades across the sky.\nThe Pleiades have been a familiar feature of the night sky in cultures around the world. The earliest discovered depiction of the cluster is the Nebra sky disk, a Bronze Age artifact found in Germany that dates back to around 1600 BCE. The stars were notably mentioned in the Bible, the Greek poet Hesiod’s Works and Days, and Homer’s Iliad and Odyssey.\nThe first astronomer to observe the Pleiades through a telescope was Galileo Galilei, who discovered that the cluster contained many other stars too faint to be visible to the naked eye. Galilei published his notes along with a sketch in March 1610.\nIn 1782, the French astronomer Edme-Sébastien Jeaurat drew a map of 64 members of the cluster and published it in 1786.\nIn Japan, the cluster was mentioned as Mutsuraboshi, meaning “six stars,” in the 8th century Kojiki (“An Account of Ancient Matters”). Today, the Japanese know the Pleiades as Subaru. The automobile company Subaru uses an image of the six brightest stars in its logo.\nThe name Alcyone (pronunciation: /ælˈsaɪəniː/) comes from Greek mythology. Alcyone was one of the Pleiades, the seven daughters of the Titan Atlas and the sea-nymph Pleione. The seven sisters were nymphs and companions of the goddess Artemis. Alcyone had three children by Poseidon: Hyrieus, Hyperenor, and Aethusa. The name Alcyone (Greek: Ἁλκυόνη) was derived from the Greek αλκυων (alkyon), meaning “kingfisher.” The Pleiad Alcyone is not to be confused with the Thessalian princess Alcyone, who was transformed into a common kingfisher along with her husband Ceyx after he had died at sea.\nThe name was officially approved for the star by the International Astronomical Union’s (IAU) Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) on June 30, 2016. It formally applies only to the component Eta Tauri A.\nThe Chinese know Alcyone as 昴宿六 (Mǎo Xiù liù), meaning “the Sixth Star of Hairy Head.” Hairy Head is a Chinese asterism consisting of the Pleiades stars Asterope, Atlas, Electra, Maia, Merope, Taygeta, and Alcyone. The asterism is one of the seven mansions of the White Tiger.\nAlcyone is easy to find because it is a member of one of the most recognizable features of the night sky. The Pleiades can be found by following an imaginary line extended from the stars of Orion’s Belt – Alnitak, Alnilam and Mintaka – but most observers will likely spot the cluster without any help because it is exceptionally large and bright.\nThe cluster is conspicuous in the sky from October to April. It is invisible in May and June, when it is too close to the Sun.\nAlcyone is located in the constellation Taurus. Representing the celestial Bull, Taurus is one of the largest constellations in the sky, covering an area of 797 square degrees. It is best known for its brightest star, Aldebaran, the 14th brightest star in the sky, and the two bright, large open clusters, the Pleiades and the Hyades. Aldebaran marks the Bull’s eye and the V-shaped Hyades cluster outlines its head.\nTaurus is home to several other well-known deep sky objects: the historic supernova remnant Messier 1, also known as the Crab Nebula, the reflection nebula NGC 1555 (Hind’s Variable Nebula), the planetary nebula NGC 1514 (Crystal Ball Nebula), the colliding galaxies NGC 1409 and NGC 1410, and the open clusters NGC 1647 and NGC 1817.\nThe best time of year to observe the stars and deep sky objects of Taurus is during the month of January.\nThe 10 brightest stars in the constellation are Aldebaran (Alpha Tau, mag. 0.86), Elnath (Beta Tau, mag. 1.65), Alcyone (Eta Tau, mag. 2.87), Tianguan (Zeta Tau, mag. 2.97), Chamukuy (Theta2 Tauri, mag. 3.40), Lambda Tauri (mag. 3.47), Ain (Epsilon Tau, mag. 3.53), Omicron Tauri (mag. 3.61), Atlas (27 Tau, mag. 3.63), and Prima Hyadum (Gamma Tau, mag. 3.654).\nAlcyone – Eta Tauri\n|U-B colour index||−0.34|\n|B-V colour index||−0.09|\n|Distance||443.5 light years (136 parsecs)|\n|Parallax||8.09 ± 0.42 mas|\n|Radial velocity||5.40 km/s|\n|Proper motion||RA: 19.34 ± 0.39 mas/yr|\n|Dec.: -43.67 ± 0.33 mas/yr|\n|Mass||5.9 – 6.1 M☉|\n|Radius||9.3 ± 0.7 R☉|\n|Rotational velocity||149 km/s|\n|Surface gravity||3.047 cgs|\n|Right ascension||03h 47m 29.077s|\n|Declination||+24° 06′ 18.49″|\n|Designations||Alcyone, Eta Tauri, η Tau, 25 Tauri, HD 23630, HR 1165, HIP 17702, GC 4541, GCRV 2135, SAO 76199, FK5 139, PPM 92898, BD+23 541, BDS 1875, CCDM 03474+2407, ALS 15094, IRAS 03445+2357, 2MASS J03472908+2406184, TYC 1800-2202-1, WDS J03475+2406A, Gaia DR2 66714384141781760|"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a0ba884b-ec80-4cf0-8b8e-ef8fc18ffd8f>","<urn:uuid:46409ecf-331a-4c6e-937a-e03df3bca6a9>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do monoculars compare to night vision devices for daytime use, and what future applications of thermal imaging technology are emerging?","answer":"For daytime use, monoculars are more versatile than night vision devices. Night vision technology can be damaged if exposed to sunlight, as the internal Image Intensifier Tubes can be destroyed. While monoculars offer various magnification levels (from 6x and below for wide landscapes to 15x and higher for distant objects), thermal imaging provides additional capabilities during daylight hours. As for future applications, thermal imaging technology is expanding into diverse fields. It's becoming instrumental in medicine for detecting fevers and potentially predicting pregnancy, in building inspection for identifying moisture and insulation issues, and in search-and-rescue operations. As thermal devices become more sophisticated, small, and inexpensive, their applications will likely continue to expand across various industries.","context":["A great alternative to a conventional set of binoculars is a small scope designed to produce magnification like a binocular but only requires a single eye like a telescope, called a monocular. Like a telescope, a monocular has a single viewing lens and body. Like binoculars, a monocular utilizes lenses and prisms to reflect light and magnify an image. When choosing to purchase a monocular, make sure to consider the range of factors that fit your intended purpose, budget, and needs. Here are five things to consider before choosing the right monocular for you:\nPurpose of the Monocular\nWhatever your viewing requirements may be for your next professional and recreational activity, there is a monocular for you. If you plan to be around water during your sailing or canoeing adventures, then a waterproof and fogproof monocular will protect your unit from the natural environment. Will darkness be an issue? No problem. Choose a night vision monocular with a sophisticated Infrared illuminator to allow night vision capability for your hunting for camping trips.\nWhile magnification levels are generally higher in a telescope, and viewing depth is generally greater in binoculars, a monocular is suitable for situations that require a lightweight and compact device. The magnification of a monocular is how much larger the viewed image is enlarged over normal and is indicated by the first number of the optical specification, as in the 12 in “12×50.” (The second number is discussed below.) Lower magnifications ensure that the zoom on the object is minimized and field of view is maximized. As the magnification increases, the field of view becomes smaller. Here are the advantages to both lower and larger levels of magnification.\n- 6x and below – These lower magnifications will keep the object smaller and are suitable for viewing wide landscapes.\n- 7x to 14x – These mid-range magnifications are a good balance between a diminished field of view and increased object size.\n- 15x and higher – These higher magnifications with decreased field of view are excellent for viewing specific objects at quite a distance\nThe objective size of a monocular is the diameter of the front lens given in millimeters and is indicated by the second number of the optical specification, as in the 50 in “12×50”. In this case, the diameter of the objective lens is 50mm, or about the average length of an adult’s thumb. This number indicates the light gathering ability of the device. Although a larger lens does allow more light and thus enhanced clarity and sharpness of the image, increased size and weight does become a factor.\nEye relief is especially significant for people who wear glasses. Eye relief, measured in millimeters, is the furthest distance that the eye can be placed from the eyepiece while allowing the widest possible field of view. If your eye is further away from the given eye relief distance, you will loose the end of the sight picture. To accommodate the offset effect of various eyewear, it is recommended that you choose an eye relief distance in the range of 14mm – 16mm.\nMonocular coatings come in a variety of finishes such as fully multi-coated, multi-coated, fully coated, and coated. Each type of coating is associated with increased brightness, clarity and reduced glare of the viewed image. Expect to pay a bit more for fully multi-coated lenses than simply coated lenses. In general, multiple coatings increase light transmittance and definition.\nThe Best Monoculars on the Market Now\n- Polaris Explorer – 12X50 High Powered Monocular – Designed for any weather environment, this powerful monocular allows you to view objects at 12 times their original size. The 50mm lens allows for a clearer and brighter range of view. At about 50 yards, individual leaves on a tree may be easily seen. Use the focusing mechanism to make minor adjustments to clarity. The Polaris Explorer High Powered Monocular features fully multi-coated lenses and renders a high quality image under low lighting conditions. In addition, the waterproof and fogproof features secure it from dirt, dust, and debris. The durable external protective material makes this monocular capable of withstanding wear and tear.\n- HDE 15x – 55x Zoom 21mm Compact Monocular – At just 4 ounces, this monocular can easy fit into your pocket or bag while allowing for the same power that much larger units offer. You will value the wide range of magnification settings from 15x up to 55x zoom allowing you see up to five miles away. The 21mm lens is most suitable for bright conditions at a long distance. To compensate for vibrations associated with higher magnification levels, the HDE® Compact Monocular comes with a tripod screw for steady viewing.\n- Night Owl Optics 5-Power NOXM50 Night Vision Monocular – For your next campout or hunting trip, amplify light under the darkest conditions with this rugged high quality monocular designed with the latest optics technology. The 5x magnification and 50mm lens with activated infrared light will clearly illuminate a small area up to about 100 yards. The Night Owl Optics Night Vision Monocular comes with a sturdy protective finish, hand strap, and plastic focus ring for increased clarity. Requires a lithium battery that is not included.\nUltimately, monoculars are single-tubed optical devices used to view distant objects under a variety of conditions. Although the main advantage over binoculars and telescopes is portability and carrying convenience, the main disadvantage is lack of comfort, depth, and ease of continuous viewing. When purchasing the right monocular for you, make sure that the purpose, magnification, objective size, eye relief, and lens coating specifications align with your sightseeing goals for a fun, comfortable, and enjoyable experience.\nUsing Your New Monocular\nOnce you’ve selected the monocular that will fulfill your needs, check out the video below to learn how to properly and effectively use your new optic:","Thermal imaging technology has been around for almost 60 years, but only for the last 20-30 years has it been available to civilians.\nThermal imaging, unlike night vision, requires no light to work. Thermal imaging detects heat signals that the naked eye misses. Thermal imaging equipment can see anything that produces heat.\nWhile hunting is its most popular use, thermal imaging’s vast range of applications ensures that it will continue to dominate technology in various industries for many years.\nThermal imaging is instrumental in law enforcement situations, such as identifying whether a car has been driven lately or whether a discarded handgun has been discharged.\nThermal imaging has also shown to be quite helpful in search-and-rescue operations. Ranchers and farmers who need to keep track of their livestock herds on significant holdings now have it as a must-have.\nThermal technology has medicinal uses; it can be used to detect fevers in animals, including humans, and it may be able to predict pregnancy.\nThermal imaging may also be used to identify trapped moisture, water leaks, airflow, insulation, and electrical issues in homes and buildings.\nAs these devices become more sophisticated, small, and inexpensive, their wide variety of applications will likely expand. In a nutshell, thermal technology is the future.\nHow does a Thermal Monocular Work\nThermal monocular detects radiation in the electromagnetic spectrum’s long-wave infrared (IR) region (wavelengths of 8– 14 micrometers).\nRegular film and digital cameras, on the other hand, can only detect light in the visible spectrum (0.40 – 0.75 micrometers), which is the fraction of the electromagnetic spectrum visible to the human eye.\nBecause all things with a temperature over absolute zero (0 Kelvin = -459 ° Fahrenheit = -273 ° Celsius) produce infrared radiation, thermal cameras can see objects with and without visible light.\nMost thermal cameras can only detect things that are warmer than -122 degrees Fahrenheit.\nDuring daylight hours, thermal imaging gives hunters a vast edge. Night-vision technology is ineffective during the day because the internal Image Intensifier Tubes (IITs) might be destroyed if exposed to sunlight; therefore, utilizing it during the day is not recommended.\nEven daytime digital night vision riflescopes lack the detection range and heat signature information of a thermal instrument.\nSo, what are the benefits of wearing a thermal throughout the day for those willing to invest the extra money?\nThe ability to see through dense undergrowth and vegetation is one of the most impressive advantages of daylight thermal use.\nHunters frequently wait for hours in the hope of catching a glimpse of their target, only to see nothing.\nThis is aggravating. With a thermal device, all those small camouflaged birds, creatures, pigs, or anything hidden in the undergrowth will instantly become apparent.\nA deer’s antlers will also show up on a thermal device like fireworks on July 4th when they are engorged with blood.\nIncrease the brightness setting on the thermal optic slightly to acquire detailed profiles of prey animals during daylight hours because the Sun will be sending out heat, therefore increase the brightness settings barely to get detailed profiles of prey animals.\nAnother typical source of annoyance is killing an animal, generally a deer, and then hunting for the wounded animal for kilometers since the shot was not a dead shot.\nDeer are mighty creatures that will run for kilometers, generally over rugged, uneven terrain, unless shot in the head or heart.\nThis difficulty is quickly remedied with a thermal – a heated blood trail will pop out on a thermal device, making it instantly visible and readily trackable.\nCold-blooded animals like reptiles and fish, for example, do not generate heat signatures and hence are not immediately detectable with a thermal instrument.\nHowever, their shape will be visible — better than nothing, similar to what you’d see with a night vision gadget or regular, un-powered glasses.\nImproved target recognition is the next topic of emphasis for thermal devices. No hunter wants to kill their neighbor’s beloved dog, cattle, or, God forbid, someone.\nThermal imaging allows for rapid and accurate target identification, eliminating the possibility of a fatal instance of mistaken identity.\nBefore using thermal devices, verify with local regulations, game wardens, and park officials. Many states and nations do not allow thermal devices; thus, getting permission before a thermal-powered hunt is essential.\nReasons why Thermal Monocular are Important\nCondenser tubes collected and amplified ambient light to produce an image in the earliest generations of night vision equipment.\nHowever, it required some form of light to magnify, whether moonlight or stray rays from a faraway city.\nThus, the devices were ineffective primarily on a moonless, clear night. Thermal imaging, a relatively recent technique, has propelled night vision into the twenty-first century.\nIf you’re planning on upgrading your night vision equipment anytime soon, here are a few things to consider.\nFollowing are the reasons why thermal monocular are important-\nThermal imaging systems, unlike night vision, do not require any light to operate. On the other hand, Thermal imagers detect minute temperature variations and utilize them to create a picture.\nEverything generates heat energy, whether a deer or a rock, which the advanced sensors convert into a colorful image.\nA thermal imager’s sensors can detect changes as small as 0.01 degrees, allowing it to determine if a set of tracks is new. When following a newly shot deer, it may even pick up the tiniest blood drips.\nSee Trough Abilities\nThermal monocular can “see through” certain obstructions that would typically block your vision because they sense temperature variations.\nYou won’t be able to scan through concrete like a superhero with your new thermal device, but you will spot a coyote skulking through a patch of tall goldenrod.\nThermal units are unaffected by smoke or fog, so if you frequently sail a boat through foggy conditions, consider their visual aids.\nThough the US Army experimented with night vision technology as early as World War II, the “starlight scope” was supplied to snipers and perimeter guards during the Vietnam conflict, marking the first time night vision technology was used seriously.\nBecause they depended on a mechanical zero, which required moving the entire six-pound device to change the crosshairs, those scopes weren’t recognized for accuracy.\nThe accuracy has considerably increased, and it is now possible to sight-in several troops with only one shot. Modern appliances are much slimmer, and the thermal cores give significantly improved imaging.\nThermal monocular allow you to see in the dark during the day. You’ll receive the exact image whether you’re in the broad Sun or the most profound darkness since they use temperature instead of light.\nIf you want to go to the range or do some daylight predator calling, you won’t have to switch optics and risk losing your zero.\nQ1 Is Thermal Monocular & Night Vision a same thing?\nNo. The goal of thermal imaging and night vision is to improve sight in low-light situations, but the physics behind the two technologies is different.\nThermal imaging catches longer wavelengths of IR, whereas night vision collects and amplifies all available light (which includes some short-wavelength infrared radiation).\nNight vision employs near-infrared (NIR) radiation (0.75–1.40 micrometers) in addition to any residual visible light, whereas most thermal imaging uses long-wavelength (8–14 micrometers) infrared radiation.\nThermal imaging systems require more sensitive sensors to detect long-wave infrared, making them more costly than night vision equipment.\nWhile night vision technology enhances visibility in low-light situations by amplifying the quantity of light in the image, thermal imaging benefits high contrast images, making it simpler to spot a target against the background.\nThe video below goes over this new feature in greater detail and the distinctions between night vision and thermal imaging.\nQ2 Can we use the thermal monocular for catching poachers?\nYes, thermal imaging has numerous uses in anti-poaching. Poachers exploit the darkness to evade discovery by wildlife authorities and park guards.\nTherefore the bulk of poaching activities take place at night.\nPoaching of elephants and rhinos and the subsequent illegal trade in ivory and rhino horn has been linked to the funding of terrorist organizations.\nAs poaching becomes more militarised, conservationists and wildlife managers turn to thermal imaging to improve their wildlife protection.\nQ3 Can A Thermal Monocular See Through Sea Water?\nThermal imaging has recently been put to the test for researching marine life by researchers.\nWhile we aren’t aware of thermal camera applications underwater, they have been used to detect marine animals from research vessels.\nThe technology may be utilized to investigate whale, dolphin, and sea surface activity.\nResearchers used a ship-mounted thermal camera with a recognition algorithm to identify the thermal signature of whale blows to automatically evaluate the potential of thermal imaging to detect cetaceans.\nDuring the day, the number of whale sightings detected by thermal imaging was equivalent to that of human marine mammal observers. More significantly, unlike people, the thermal camera can identify marine animals at night.\nThis system might help decrease whale strikes by informing ships when to turn off their noisy airguns, sonars, and other instruments, reducing the detrimental effects on marine mammals.\nThe advantages of thermal imaging equipment are incredible. Thermal can assist you whether you are hunting during the day or at night.\nDuring the day, you’ll have better vision thanks to vegetation and concealment, be able to follow a blood trail, and identify targets more easily, particularly smaller animals and varmint.\nCold-blooded animals will be seen, but only as silhouettes. Overall, the sole disadvantage of thermal imaging is that it is more expensive than other professional optics; however, this cost is countered by the various hunting and scouting benefits that thermal imaging delivers."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8199d8b9-1bc3-4109-bd55-2146f80ba156>","<urn:uuid:bb6e594f-bc26-4040-b27c-a0497073ebe3>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What role do both glutathione and vitamin C play in supporting collagen production and skin health, and how do their mechanisms differ?","answer":"Both glutathione and vitamin C contribute to skin health but through different mechanisms. Vitamin C directly assists in the production of collagen, which is necessary for healthy skin, cartilage, tendons, ligaments, and blood vessels. Glutathione, on the other hand, works at the cellular level to fight inflammation and preserve cell health, which is crucial for healthy organs including the skin (which is considered an organ). Glutathione also helps slow the aging process and protects against wrinkles by defending cells against toxins, free radicals, and oxidative stress, then immediately working to repair any cellular damage. While both nutrients are important for skin health, glutathione provides broader cellular protection and repair functions beyond just collagen production.","context":["Experts in Prescription Drug Withdrawal\nA MEDICAL PERSPECTIVE\nGlutathione (GSH) is a peptide, composed of amino acid strings that are the basic building blocks of protein. This miraculous tripeptide (three amino acids) is probably the most important cellular defense that allows the body to prevent and fight infections and disease.\nThe immune system is an elegant and complex group of components that combine to fight disease, infections, and various pathogens. A healthy immune system differentiates organisms in the body as natural, which are untouched, or invaders that are rapidly destroyed. A healthy immune system is able to combat the attack, whereas a compromised immune system allows invading organisms to flourish.\nThe body's immune response relies on various white blood cells and natural barriers to block any attack any foreign invader. All cells normally produce damaged molecules called free radicals. These free radicals are highly unstable and steal components from cellular molecules, including fat, protein or DHA, that spreads the damage. Antioxidants are invaluable because they prevent widespread cellular destruction by willingly donating components to stabilize free radical damage. When there are not enough antioxidants to protect the cells, free radicals attack healthy cells and break down health. The 'Master Antioxidant' of the body that recharges all other antioxidants is Glutathione.\nGlutathione is manufactured by every one of our trillions of cells, and the level of Glutathione in our cells is predictive of how long we will live. Glutathione also plays a crucial role in the regulation of many body functions required to sustain life. No other antioxidant is as imperative to overall health as Glutathione.\nGlutathione boosts white blood cell production to fight infection, particularly the T-cells, which are called lymphocytes. T-cells are at the core of our immunity, and tailor the body's immune response to pathogens, viral and bacterial infections or anything the cells recognize as being invasive. T-cells directly attack and destroy infectious agents and guard the body against attack. T-cells are produced in the bone marrow and mature in the thymus, but are present in the blood and lymph nodes.\nStudies have shown that Glutathione is food for the immune cells, boosting the strength of lymphocytes. B-cell lymphocytes identify the unwanted pathogen that the T-cells then attack. T-cells also shut down the immune response when the job is done. An overactive immune system can make mistakes as in the case of allergies, when a harmless substance is identified as dangerous. Lupus, Multiple Sclerosis, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Lou Gehrig's disease, Crohn's disease, Grave's disease and chronic fatigue syndrome are examples of autoimmune diseases, or the immune system not shutting down properly and actually in turn attacking the body.\nIntracellular Glutathione fights inflammation and preserves cell health. It also works to improve cognitive function, improve circulation, increase energy, and improve heart and lung function. Glutathione has also shown to slow the aging process. Energy, healthy organs and skin (the skin is an organ) all require healthy cells. Glutathione is cell food.\nLow Glutathione levels are linked to health challenges and diseases such as Cancer, Multiple Sclerosis, AIDS, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, Atherosclerosis, Pregnancy Complications, Cataracts, Asthma, Autism, Bronchitis, Fibromyalgia, Insomnia, Male infertility, Migraines, Osteoporosis, Pain, Poor Eyesight, PMS, Psoriasis, Wrinkles, Low Sex Drive, Chronic Fatigue, Balding and Cirrhosis.\nGlutathione is not only important to the natural detoxification process within the body that eliminates toxins and carcinogens but is also essential to heal the damage within the cells. Every moment Glutathione is defending our body against disease, toxins, poisons, viruses, pollutants, radiation, drugs and oxidative stress, then immediately works to repair any damage from free radicals. Glutathione is essential for DNA synthesis and repair, protein and fat synthesis, the regulation of enzymes and amino acid transport. Each cell in the body is responsible for its own supply of Glutathione and needs the raw materials to produce it.\nOne of Glutathione's primary jobs is to alleviate oxidative stress, which is a chemical reaction that occurs when cells are injured. Viruses, bacteria, exposure to environmental toxins, medications, or heavy metal toxicity can damage cells, as does the normal aging process. If sufficient Glutathione is not present, toxins can overload the liver and lead to excessive fat-soluble toxins depositing within our fatty cells. The brain, nervous system, breasts and prostate are mostly fat and can become receptacles for pollutants. Many researchers theorize that the increase in brain diseases (Alzheimer's, MS and Parkinson's) and cancers, such as Prostate and Breast cancer, are linked to depleted Glutathione.\nAntioxidants are nutrients or substances that prevent or slow the oxidative damage to our body. Glutathione is referred to as the 'Master Antioxidant' because it recharges all other antioxidants in the body.\nFree radicals are highly reactive molecules that modify, disrupt and impair the stable structure within our body. The oxygen we breathe helps to burn sugar and fat inside our body cells to produce energy. But about 2% of the converted oxygen remains as free radicals. If these reactive elements are not neutralized, cell membranes breakdown and DNA is damaged, resulting in a compromised immune system, disease and rapid aging. Many environmental and ingested agents spur free radical production – air pollution, pesticides, radiation, alcohol, sugar, cigarette smoke, illegal drugs and prescription medications.\nTo combat the hostile effects of free radicals, our bodies use antioxidants (free radical scavengers), which help to extinguish the biochemical fire. Bruce Ames, Ph.D., at the University of California, Berkeley, estimates that every single one of our cells suffers from 10,000 hits by free radicals daily.\nGlutathione is used more than any other antioxidant in the body, and is the most abundant natural antioxidant that protects our vision, boosts the immune system, helps turn carbohydrates into energy and prevents the buildup of oxidized fats that contribute to heart disease. Glutathione supports us at the cellular level by protecting every cell of the body, but our levels decline dramatically with age. By age 20 we are losing Glutathione at 8-12% per decade. But compromised health and excessive use of medications can deplete the body stores more rapidly. Some scientists estimate that a 30% reduction of Glutathione is enough for cellular dysfunction to set in.\nThe brain consumes about 20% of the oxygen utilized by the body but constitutes only 2% of the body weight and is therefore particularly susceptible to free radical attacks. Glutathione acts to prevent and protect the brain from the damage of free radicals.\nOur bodies are constantly replacing and repairing free-radical damaged cells, but the demands of the modern age have created high levels of free radicals with limited supplies of intracellular Glutathione to correct the damage. Without Glutathione, other antioxidants such as vitamins C and E cannot perform their functions adequately to protect the body against disease.\nGlutathione even protects both the mother and the developing fetus from the damaging effects of free radicals, and minimizes the oxidative stress that occurs during labor and the birth process. The placenta contains a significant amount of glutathione to filter pollutants before they reach the baby.\nIn the last 75 years, clean and healthy food supplies have been replaced by sugar, processed food, chemicals, genetically altered fruit and vegetables, chemical and hormone laced dairy products, hormone and preservative laden meats, high saturated fats with sugar, thousands of medications and pesticides.\nThere are tens of thousands of confirmed toxic substances in our environment and as a result, obesity, heart disease, diabetes, allergies and mental health issues are rampant. The liver is our ultimate filter and has two critical functions: to process nutrients and eliminate toxins from the body. It does this by cleansing the blood at about two quarts a minute. Approximately 25% of all the blood in the body is filtered through the liver at any one time. Some glutathione is released directly by the liver into the bloodstream where it helps to maintain the strength of red blood cells while also protecting the white blood cells.\nLarge quantities of Glutathione are found in the eyes, lungs, kidneys and also the liver where a two-stage detoxification process takes place. Phase One begins the chemical conversion of harmful compounds that are mainly fat-soluble into intermediate forms. But Phase Two is where the final transformation takes place to help convert the intermediate toxins into water-soluble substances that can be excreted through the bowel or kidneys. Only water-soluble substances can be excreted. If there is not enough Glutathione to generate the Phase two enzymes, toxins will build to dangerous levels in the liver.\nUnlike unnatural detoxification supplements, the use of Glutathione is a natural process that allows our body to perform its filtering capability organically and comfortably. Many herbs that detoxify will also deplete valuable minerals and vitamins. Glutathione inherently builds and nourishes.\nGlutathione is a critical element for good health, strong immune function, cancer prevention and the slowing of the aging process. Glutathione is necessary to neutralize free radicals, repair cell damage, detoxify toxins and to recharge all other antioxidants. Basically, increasing Glutathione levels enhances life.\n*While great care has been taken in organizing and presenting the material throughout this website, please note that it is provided for informational purposes only and should not be taken as Medical Advice.

MORE...\nApproximately 50% of the body’s Glutathione production is achieved through the consumption of fruits and vegetables. Prior to the modern age, our food sources used to be sufficient to handle the demands placed on our bodies. But eating enough glutathione-rich foods only works in an idealized world where medications, stress, toxins and fast food are not factors. The depleting elements have grown exponentially in our environment while our food sources have become compromised with pesticides, genetically modified foods and limited availability of organic fruits and vegetables. Only a small amount of reduced Glutathione from foods can reach the bloodstream, while most is lost in the digestive tract. So the need for Glutathione production has risen dramatically while our ability to produce it naturally has diminished.\nMany synthetic medications and supplements claim to raise Glutathione, but some can cause toxicity, troublesome side effects and many can interact with various medications. Bioactive microfiltered undenatured whey Protein isolates can be an efficient and cost-effective manner to raise this critical antioxidant.\nBelow are the most frequently used methods to raise Glutathione:\nWhey Protein Isolates\nMilk is inherent to all mammals, including humans, and Whey Protein is an element of milk. All mammalian breast milk contains naturally high amounts of Glutathione to protect the infant. Human breast milk is no exception, and also contains high levels of healthy bacteria to colonize the baby's gut region with Probiotics, the healthy bacteria that helps sustain life.\nCows milk contains 5-10% protein - 20% whey and 80% lactose and cheese fat (caseine). Most allergies to milk are from the lactose and cheese caseine. Only a tiny percentage of the public has a true allergy to whey.\nIn the 1930s, the compulsory pasteurization of milk caused high temperature processing that denatured (damaged) the protein structures. Denaturation causes less bioactive availability of the critical active components to the cells. All commercial milk today is pasteurized and as a result, the potent Glutathione precursors have been rendered ineffective.\nMost whey protein that is found in natural food or sports nutrition will not increase Glutathione levels. Whey proteins can contain anywhere from 20%-90% whey, a few are bioactive while most are not. Many use high temperature processing to extract the whey, which damages the delicate protein structure.\nOnly specialized Undenatured (intact) whey protein isolates that employ unique filtering and processing methods to extract the whey from the protein can generate intracellular Glutathione. This microfiltering process ensures the two Cysteine molecules remain linked together and can sustain the trip through the digestive system to convert to Glutathione. For a detailed explanation of the difference in whey proteins, click here.\nUsing bioactive whey protein isolate is a safe, comfortable and effective way to generate Glutathione without side effects.\nThe famous Louis Pasteur Institute for Research issues a book every year that goes to all the major medical schools in the U.S.A., Europe and Canada. The book, entitled “Oxidative Stress in Cancer, Aids and Neurodegenerative Diseases,” was co-authored by Luc Montagnier, co-discoverer of the AIDS virus. Chapter 42 is entirely devoted to a discussion of the Immune Enhancing Whey Protein. It states, “Nutraceutical Modulation of Glutathione with a Humanized Native Milk Serum Protein Isolate, Bioactive Whey Protein: Application in Cancer and AIDS.”\nIngesting direct Glutathione does not raise Glutathione levels since it is poorly absorbed through the digestive system. The fragile tripeptide (3-amino acid) structure of Glutathione makes surviving the digestive tract a near impossibility. Additionally, your cells must generate their own Glutathione to be effective.\nGlutathione must breakdown to its reduced form to work properly within the cells. But introducing the reduced form directly to the body is much like taking oral Glutathione – the effectiveness is lost. Supplementation with reduced Glutathione does not raise tissue levels of this critical antioxidant. Reduced Glutathione is also expensive and not metabolically active. Many doctors report that the clinical benefits achieved with intravenous reduced glutathione are not reproduced when it is taken orally.\nCysteine or L-Cysteine\nGlutathione is a tripeptide (3-amino acid) comprised of Cysteine, Glutamic Acid and Glycine. Consuming these three amino acids independently does not ensure Glutathione production and can actually be harmful. Cysteine is the precursor to Glutathione and extremely important to Glutathione production, yet taking Cysteine is ineffective since it is potentially toxic. Cysteine is spontaneously oxidized in the gastrointestinal tract and the bloodstream and cannot reach the cells. Cysteine that does make it into the bloodstream can be further oxidized and do more damage than good. Cysteine may be one of the building blocks of Glutathione, but alone has a negligible impact on raising Glutathione levels.\nN-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) is a synthetic version of Cysteine that is rapidly converted to the amino acid Cysteine. NAC supplements are moderately effective, but dosing is limited due to the toxic side effects (such as headaches, dizziness, blurred vision) associated with Cysteine Supplementation. NAC decreases Zinc, so supplementing with additional zinc and copper is recommended along with Vitamin C to help prevent the Cysteine from converting to Cystine, which can form kidney and bladder stones.\nRecent Study on NAC:\nAccording to recent research at The University of Virginia, N-Acetyl-Cysteine forms a red blood cell derived molecule that makes blood vessels think they are not getting enough oxygen. This leads to pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), a serious condition characterized by high blood pressure in the arteries that carry blood to the lungs. The results appeared in the September 2009 issue of the Journal of Clinical Investigation.\nMany supplements include N-Acetyl-Cysteine:\nMax GXL uses N-Acetyl-Cysteine (see N-Acetyl-Cysteine), but also has Alpha Lipoic Acid, Vitamin C, Quercetin, L-Glutathione (see oral Glutathione), N-Acetyl-d-Glucosamine, Milk Thistle and N-Acetyl Cysteine (see Cysteine).\nAlong with the danger of toxicity from direct Cysteine (see Cysteine), people with diabetes mellitus and allergies to eggs, milk or wheat should not supplement with Cysteine. Anyone with kidney or liver disease should consult their physician before taking Cysteine supplements due to the risk of bladder and kidney stones. Additionally, several items in Max GXL may interact with some medications.\nFor example, Milk Thistle may interact with antipsychotics, Phenytoin (seizure medication), Halothane (used during general anesthesia), Allergy medications, Statins (cholesterol), Anti-Anxiety medications, Antiplatelet and Anticoagulant drugs (blood thinners) and some cancer drugs.\nQuercetin interacts with Cyclosporine (immunosuppressant), Antibiotics, and medications that are broken down by the CYP2C8 liver enzymes. This includes some diabetes medications, hormones, anticonvulsants, Antidepressants, Antifungal, Ibuprofen, Potassium Channel Blockers and High Blood Pressure Medications, to name a few.\nDelivering Glutathione through an IV is effective but expensive and uncomfortable, and requires infusions two times per week using an Intravenous (IV) line. Glutathione precursors are a better solution.\nTopical Glutathione Creams / Gels\nUsing a cream or Glutathione gel to raise Glutathione levels is ineffective and can have significant side effects. Glutathione is a highly sensitive molecule that must be created within the cells. Absorbing direct Glutathione to the skin does not allow the cells to produce this critical antioxidant.\nThe small benefit is lost when the active ingredients, such as direct Glutathione, decompose when it is added to creams or gels. Evaluation of topical Glutathione applications does not show any significant effect on Glutathione production.\n- Oral GSH\n- Milk Thistle\n- Pub Med - Metabolism and functions of glutathione in brain.\n- Pub Med - clinical trial of glutathione in cases of hepatic cirrhosis.\n- Nutritional Advisor – glutathione\n- Free-RadicalsAntioxidants – Your Defense Against Them\n- The importance of glutathione in human disease\n- Importance of Glutathione for Growth and Survival of Escherichia coli Cells: Detoxification of Methylglyoxal and Maintenance of Intracellular K+\n- Topical GSH\n- GSH, Your Body's Most Powerful Protector by Dr. Jimmy Gutman (book) not a link","Vitamin C is an antioxidant present in many fruits and vegetables. Also known as L-ascorbic acid, vitamin C has a wide variety of uses in the body. It supports normal growth and development and helps the body repair damaged tissue.[2, 3] Vitamin C also assists in the production of collagen, a protein that’s necessary for healthy skin, cartilage, tendons, ligaments, and blood vessels.\nTo say that vitamin C is beneficial would be an understatement. It influences iron absorption and helps fight cell-damaging free radicals. A 16-year study found that regular vitamin C supplementation promoted heart health. Additionally, people who consume foods rich in vitamin C or other antioxidants may lower their risk of high blood pressure.[7, 8, 9]\nHigh Doses of Vitamin C\nIn the 1970s, chemist and Nobel Peace laureate, Linus Pauling, proposed that high doses of vitamin C could help prevent the common cold. Many people swear by Pauling's claim that vitamin C can boost the immune system naturally, but the research is still inconclusive.\nA number of studies have examined whether high-dose vitamin C can provide extraordinary therapeutic results. Results thus far are inconclusive. However, animal studies have found that vitamin C may make traditional therapies more effective.\nNatural Dietary Sources of Vitamin C\nMany types of food are fortified with vitamins and vitamin C is usually in the mix. However, like all vitamins, it’s best to get your daily intake from organic, natural sources and the best, natural sources of vitamin C are fruits and vegetables. Below are some of the best foods for vitamin C.\n|Sources of Vitamin C|\n|Food and Serving Size||Vitamin C (mg/serving)|\n|Red or Yellow Bell Pepper, Raw, 1/2 cup||95|\n|Orange Juice, 3/4 cup||93|\n|Orange, 1 medium||70|\n|Grapefruit Juice, 3/4 cup||70|\n|Kiwifruit, 1 medium||64|\n|Green Bell Pepper, raw, 1/2 cup||60|\n|Broccoli, cooked, 1/2 cup||51|\n|Strawberries, fresh, sliced 1/2 cup||49|\n|Brussels sprouts, cooked, ½ cup||48|\n|Grapefruit, ½ medium||39|\n|Broccoli, raw, ½ cup||39|\n|Tomato juice, ¾ cup||33|\n|Cantaloupe, ½ cup||29|\n|Cabbage, cooked, ½ cup||28|\n|Cauliflower, raw, ½ cup||26|\n|1 Lemon Yield, 48g||18.6|\n|Potato, baked, 1 medium||17|\n|Tomato, raw, 1 Medium||17|\n|Spinach, cooked, 1/2 cup||9|\n|Green peas, frozen, cooked, 1/2 cup||8|\nDaily Intake of Vitamin C\nThe amount of vitamin C that a person needs may vary with factors like age or whether a person is smoking, pregnant, or even breastfeeding. These are the guidelines provided by the U.S. Office of Dietary Supplements:\n|Recommended Daily Allowances of Vitamin C|\n|Age||Female||Male||Pregnant female||Breastfeeding female|\n|0-6 months||40 mg||40 mg||N/A||N/A|\n|7-12 months||50 mg||50 mg||N/A||N/A|\n|1-3 years||15 mg||15 mg||N/A||N/A|\n|4-8 years||25 mg||25 mg||N/A||N/A|\n|9-13 years||45 mg||45 mg||N/A||N/A|\n|14-18 years||65 mg||75 mg||80 mg||115 mg|\n|19+ years||75 mg||90 mg||85 mg||120 mg|\nDangers of Vitamin C Deficiency\nA lot of people might think “scurvy” is just pirate lingo, but it’s actually a disease caused by a lack of vitamin C. Symptoms of scurvy include fatigue, gum disease, anemia, scaly skin, and easy bruising. Vitamin C deficiency is uncommon in the United States these days but some people remain at risk.\nPeople who get too little variety in their food may not receive adequate nutrition. Normally, when we hear \"malnourished\" many of us think \"starving\", but what it's more likely to mean is that a person is deficient in specific nutrients and it's affecting their health. Those who rely on a carnivorous diet might miss their daily quota for vitamin C as meat and dairy don’t contain much of this critical nutrient. Infants fed evaporated or boiled cow's milk may not get enough vitamin C, especially since cow’s milk is low in vitamin C to begin with. Breast milk and infant formula are both better sources of vitamin C.\nSome medical conditions can cause vitamin C deficiency. Digestive tract injuries or inefficiencies, genetic diseases, and other issues can negatively affect not just vitamin C absorption, but nutrient absorption as a whole. Kidney disease and some types of cancer can also cause vitamin C deficiency.\nSmoking cigarettes is a bad idea for many reasons. One of the effects of the tissue damage it causes is the body using up vitamin C at a faster rate than normal. As a result, smokers and people exposed to second-hand smoke may need an extra 35 mg of vitamin C a day.\nVitamin C Supplementation\nUsually, if you follow a balanced diet with a foundation of organic fruits and vegetables, you’ll get all the vitamin C you need. If you don’t, vitamin C supplementation might be something to consider and discuss with your healthcare provider.\nBe aware of the difference between synthetic and natural vitamins. Synthetic supplements are manufactured with unnatural ingredients and chemicals. They are made to mimic natural vitamins but not everyone is convinced of their efficacy. Conversely, natural supplements are made using ingredients drawn straight from their natural sources.\nVitamin C supplements are usually available as ascorbic acid, sodium ascorbate, or calcium ascorbate. Synthetic and natural ascorbic acid have similar properties, but I always recommend a natural, plant-based source.[15, 16]\nIf your diet isn’t providing you with enough vitamin C, you should consider that it's not providing you with all the other nutrients your body requires, either. In such a case, you may want to skip the vitamin C supplement and look for a solid multivitamin. I recommend IntraMAX® and believe, without a doubt, that it’s the best multivitamin available anywhere. It’s an organic, liquid formula loaded with all the nutrients you need, as well as powerful antioxidant and immune system stimulators. It's as complete as it gets.\nWhere do you get your vitamin C?

{"question":"What significant historical impact did the 8th century Buddhist-Hindu tensions have on religious institutions, and how does this compare to the organizational structure of early Buddhist councils?","answer":"During the 8th century, Buddhist-Hindu tensions were significant as Buddhism gained popularity, especially among lower castes, while Hindu institutions felt threatened under the Buddhist Pala kings' rule. This conflict manifested in debates over temple access and armed resistance. In contrast, Buddhism had a well-organized structure through its councils, with four major ones held between 483 BC and 78 AD. These councils systematically compiled Buddhist literature and doctrine, including the Vinaya, Sutta Pitaka, and Abhidhamma Pitaka, ultimately leading to the division between Hinayana and Mahayana during the fourth council under King Kanishka.","context":["Grant Period: over four months\nAbhishek Majumdar is a playwright, teacher, actor and the Artistic Director of the theatre group Indian Ensemble in Bangalore. Abhishek is a graduate from LISPA (London International School of Performing Arts) and has trained at Yatrik, Mahesh Dattani’s Studio and the Adishakti Theatre Lab. He has received various fellowships and grants including the Charles Wallace and the Inlaks scholarships. He is a member of the Young Vic Director’s Network, London and the Lincoln Center Director’s Lab 2011, New York. He is the recipient of the first Shankar Nag Rangakarmi Award given by Ranga Shankara, Bangalore for his contribution to theatre. His notable plays include An arrangement of shoes, The Djinns of Idgah, Afterlife of Birds, Rizwan, Kaumudi and Dweepa to name a few. Last year IFA had supported a series of workshops for his group Indian Ensemble to explore and create a methodology for physical alphabets for theatre. He approached IFA for support for his new play Muktidham.\nThe Hindi play written by him is set in 8th century in the fictional town of Beerpur. This is the period in India’s history when Pala kings are ruling over large parts of northern India and are followers of Buddhism. Buddhism is gaining popularity and people especially from the lower castes are converting to embrace it. Buddhism is at its peak while Hindu institutions in the kingdom are feeling threatened. The fictional town of Beerpur is surrounded by Buddhists and the surviving Hindu matha is subject to a crucial internal and external struggle. Nath Nand, the head of the matha, has decided to retire to Muktidham to die in peace and must choose his successor. He has always separated politics from religion and now has to choose between two of his disciples and scholars of the matha – Yuyutsu and Agnivesh. Yuyutsu is in favour of opening the doors of the temple to the lower caste to stop them from converting to Buddhism. Agnivesh believes in an armed resistance against the Buddhists. There are also questions of caste-identity, power and patriarchy in their personal lives that each character must deal with. The play is based on detailed research of the period and often takes clues from historical events. Abhishek has submitted a detailed bibliography of materials that he has consulted for research towards this play.\nAbhishek wrote the play over the last two years as a response to the current political scenario in India with the rise of right wing Hindutva. The election of the current Government came as a shock to him like many. He tried to make sense of the insecurities and aspirations of people in the country that pushed them to make their choice. For him, “...this play is about believers. It is not an argument between believers and non-believers since that has been done to death. The question is what the various positions within belief are and how a believer needs to have a certain responsibility and wisdom to know when something is cosmic and when it’s just power play. To write Muktidham as a believer has been my greatest challenge and I am not sure if I am achieving that.” The play aims to examine the roots of Hindu philosophy and how the communal right wing that originated from intellectual thought, turned increasingly dogmatic and anti-intellectual. It also raises complex questions about caste, patriarchy and personal faith that are often intertwined in a complex web.\nBoth the external evaluators have recommended making this grant and think it is an extremely relevant play in these times. They have suggested that Abhishek pay more attention to the production process and audience engagement. They think it is ambitious, complex and courageous. Working with Abhishek earlier, one knows that he starts his process not knowing all the answers but engages in deep enquiries as his work progresses. Given his reputation in the field as one of India’s most promising theatre directors one also trusts his ability to create a play that would raise questions that engage the common audience while earning critical acclaim.\nThere are obvious challenges of supporting this work. In the recent years many works of art have been subjected to censorship, vandalised and banned by the extreme right wing forces. Abhishek himself has received threats for his last play Dweepa and been questioned by authorities for his public opinions on social media. Many of the funders who promised to support this work have backed out after reading drafts of the play. This play is obviously raising uncomfortable questions about religion, politics, caste and patriarchy. Given IFA’s core value of supporting works that raise critical enquiries these are risks worth taking. While the results of the workshops that IFA supported earlier for Indian Ensemble will manifest over a long period of time in their work, some of it will find its way in this play.\nThe play is slated to open at Ranga Shankara in January 2017 and will tour some of the renowned theatre festivals in the country in the next few months. Various drafts of the script, research material, draft designs, photographs and audio-video recording of the shows will be deposited as deliverables at the end of the grant period.","Here, we are giving the complete study material of ‘Buddhism & Jainism’ that will ease the journey of aspirants to crack the competitive examinations like BPSC and other state-level examinations.\nBuddhism and Jainism\nCauses of Origin\n- The Kshatriya reaction against the domination of the priestly class called Brahmanas. Mahavira and Gautama Buddha, both belonged to the Kshatriya clan.\n- Indiscriminate killing of cattle for Vedic sacrifices and for food had led to the destabilization of the new agricultural economy which was dependent on cattle for ploughing the fields. Both Buddhism and Jainism stood against this killing.\n- The growth of cities with the increase in the circulation of Punch Marked coins and trade and commerce had added to the importance of Vaishyas who looked for a new religion to improve their position. Jainism and Buddhism facilitated their needs\n- The new forms of property created social inequalities and the common people wanted to get back to their primitive form of life\n- Growing complexity and degeneration of Vedic religion.\nDifference between Jainism and Buddhism and Vedic Religion\n- They did not attach any importance to the existing Varna system\n- They preached the Gospel of non-violence\n- They accepted Vaishyas, including the Moneylenders who were condemned by Brahmanas\n- They preferred simple, puritan and ascetic living\nGautama Buddha and Buddhism\nGautama Buddha was born in 563 BC in the Republican clan of Shakyas in Lumbini near Kapilavastu.

{"question":"How do the travel accommodations differ between the Volterra workshop and the Sicilian cycling tour?","answer":"The Volterra workshop provides accommodation at the Volterra International Residential College with shared or private bath options at $1875-$2325, including a communal kitchen and optional meal plan at local restaurants for $1125. In contrast, the Sicilian cycling tour offers stays in small hotels and agriturismi (farm stays) along the route, with breakfast included in the base price of £1525-£1785, depending on the season.","context":["In October, 2016, a small team of researchers and professionals embarked upon a journey to digitally reconstruct and preserve many of the historically significant architectural, archeological and artistic treasures of the ancient city of Volterra, Italy. The results of this and subsequent workshops (in June, 2017; April, 2018; April 2019 and October 2022) have had great value to the team and the City of Volterra and have been recognized by nearly 40 international publications. We are very proud that our work was one of four projects to be recognized by the prestigious American Institute of Architects Technology in Architectural Practice Innovation Awards program and has most recently been featured by National Geographic in their documentary series “Lost Treasures of Rome” in the “Secrets of the Colosseum” episode.\nIn addition to having produced spectacular photo-realistic virtual replicas which may be used to share the experience of the city to anyone in the world, and for the city to have precise documentation for potential future reconstruction, the data has been used for research on ancient architecture which has resulted in significant discoveries and have been presented at several prestigious international archeological conferences.\nThere is still much work to be done and many more exciting discoveries to be made. We are therefore very pleased to offer you the extraordinary opportunity to join our team for our next workshop.\nThis workshop will provide an international educational and cultural experience in which participants will actively participate in digitally preserving and communicating the history of sites within the ancient City of Volterra, its archaeological remains and some of its treasured artwork. Participants will have hands-on experience using handheld cameras through photogrammetric technologies, and laser scanners to capture historically significant sites in the city and some of its treasured artworks. You will then learn how to utilize the capture data to produce various digital models, virtual reality experiences and other documentation to be able to digitally preserve and communicate the history of the sites.\nWe also hope to provide the participants with exposure to reality capture processes utilizing Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV/Drones), but are currently working through changing regulations which may prohibit us from doing so.\nThe workshop will be led by subject matter specialists and will take place at the Volterra International Residential College. It will provide an unparalleled opportunity for participants to learn hands-on about these emerging and innovative technologies while collaboratively producing digital replicas of one of the most beautiful cities in the world; all while living and working there for two weeks!\nThe workshop will be held in Volterra, Italy, an ancient Etruscan town in the middle of Tuscany. The hill upon which the city is located has been inhabited continuously for over 3000 years, and bears witness to all periods of its development, through architecture, material culture and tradition. Please see the Volterra-Detroit Foundation website for more information about the city (www.volterra-detroit.org)\nProcesses and Technologies\nThe workshop will provide all participants the opportunity to learn and participate hands on with the following technologies and processes:\nWe will utilize hand-held cameras to photographically capture artefacts, sculptures and small sites within the city and in museums. We also hope to utilize Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV’s) or drones to photographically capture larger areas and sites outside of the city (depending on us successfully working through changing regulations).\nTextured mesh models and point cloud models will be produced from the photos using Autodesk ReCap Photo software with cloud services and potentially other software. On the left – a 3D model of a Corinthian column from the Roman theater in Volterra now installed in a wall of a XII century chapel.\n|2. Laser Scanning\nBuilding exteriors and interiors will be captured into detailed point clouds using laser scanning technology. The point clouds will be registered and processed into models using Leica and Autodesk ReCap software. Textured mesh-models will be created from ReCap and Cintoo applications for visualization uses. Point clouds will also by linked into Autodesk Revit software to be used to construct detailed Historic Building Information Models (HBIM). On the left – a laser scanning of the Roman Theater in Volterra.\n|3. Scan to BIM\nPoint clouds will also by linked into Autodesk Revit software to be used to construct detailed Historic Building Information Models (HBIM) and AutoCAD to produce precise two dimensional documentation as well. On the left – Revit model/scan data composite of the Volterra Baptistery.\n|4. Interactive Model Display\nModels created will be prepared and optimized for experiencing through Epic Games Twinmotion and Unreal Engine software where interactive experiences may be developed to tell stories of their historical significance. On the left – VR model of the Etruscan Gate in Volterra.\n|5. Managing and Sharing Scan and BIM Data via the Cloud\nWe will utilize the Cintoo webservice to share and view large scan datasets in the cloud including in VR. This platform will also be used to combine and compare BIM and scan data as well as convert and download point clouds to textured mesh models for use in other visualization applications and VR.\nSubject Matter and Workshop Focus\nIn past workshops our primary focus has been on capturing the many amazing sites in the city. This year, although we will still be doing some capture, we are going to focus more on producing digital models, virtual experiences and documentation from the capture data. Therefore, we are going to encourage each participant to select and focus on one site, using either capture data we already have or will capture during the workshop to do so. This will include researching the history of the site and explaining that in the documentation and virtual experiences you will be creating.\nWe will conduct regular conference calls with the team leading up to the workshop to discuss these opportunities and to discover your own areas of interest to assist in site selection and to establish the final program.\nWho Should Attend?\nProfessionals and students who have an interest in extending their knowledge through hands-on educational application of emerging reality capture technologies for any or all the following applications:\n- Architecture – Efficiently creating Building Information Models of existing structures for use in as-built documentation, facilities management and design retrofits from laser scans.\n- Urban Design and Planning – Efficiently creating digital models of large, complex urban environments captured using photogrammetric technology via drones and combined with other site features using GIS data.\n- Historical Preservation – Creation of photo-realistic digital models of historic structures and artifacts captured using photogrammetric technology via drones and laser scans that may be used to better document important works and for potential use in reconstruction.\n- Archeology – Efficiently creating accurate digital representations of archeological sites such as the Roman Theater captured using photogrammetric technology via drones and laser scans. Also, combining known but buried archeological sites in a digital city model to better communicate the important history of cities.\n- Art History – Creation of photo-realistic digital models of important historical works of art via photogrammetric technology and laser scans to better document, study and share the works of art. Also, digital models could be used to create physical replicas of the art that may be experienced by touch.\n- Public Relations, Marketing, Tourism – Using all of these technological processes to better communicate the experience and rich history of a city.\nTechnology Skills Required\nWhile we would prefer to have participants who have at least some basic familiarity with reality capture and modeling processes, novices are welcome as the length of the workshop permits adequate time to learn the technologies. We will also provide selected participants with introductory learning material on the software we will be using before the beginning of the workshop so that you may have time to familiarize yourself. So, all are welcome to join us to participate and learn. Most importantly, we encourage all participants to share their knowledge with each other in an open, collaborative environment which we strive to maintain and expect from all participants.\nWorkshop Length and Format\nThe workshop will take place over a 12-day period which will allow adequate time to produce the outlined subject matter and to provide the participants with hands-on training and experience with all of the reality capture technologies and modeling software. Workshop facilitators will lead groups of participants who will focus on different subject matter and/or capture and modeling processes.

The town was rebuilt in 1693, and offers the perfect start to your tour of Baroque Sicily. After your briefing with our Sicilian rep, going through the route notes and providing you with useful tips;,the remainder of the day can be spent visiting the town of Palazzolo Acreide on foot, exploring the winding lanes of the medieval part of town. Famed for its Baroque architecture, the town is jam-packed with unmissable sights, like its Basilica of San Paolo and the Basilica of San Sebastiano, both of which are UNESCO World Heritage Sites.\n- Meals: Breakfast\n- Ascent: 515 Metres Approx.\nGrabbing your bikes, you’ll say ciao to Palazzolo Acreide. You have the option to first cycle to the Greek archaeological site of Akrai. Here take the opportunity to discover the ancient ruins, where you’ll find a Greek Theatre and the Temple of Aphrodite. The surrounding view of the Hybleaen mountains is stunning!\nGetting back on your bikes, you’ll cycle through Hyblaean territory to the hill-top city of Ragusa Ibla, making your way past ancient dry stone walls, through valleys with lush Mediterranean vegetation. Ragusa Ibla is not only another Baroque jem, but it was part of the film setting in the popular Inspector Montalbano’s TV series.\nThe last section of your ride will offer up an awe-inspiring descent into Modica, your destination for the evening. Modica, a UNESCO-listed city, sits majestically in a valley and is famed for its Duomo of St Giorgio which is well worth a visit.\n- Meals: Breakfast\n- Ascent: 260 Metres Approx.\nBefore heading away from Modica, we recommend a visit to the town’s famous Cioccolateria, to sample the famous chocoloate (Cioccolato di Modica), often described as the best Italian chocolate. Your ride will begin with a downhill stretch as you make your way to the charming town of Scicli. You’ll cycle through a fertile valley, with small quaint farm holds, carob and pomegranate plantations and small reservoirs, all with a back drop of terraced hills. In Scicili, take some time to explore the town and the enchanting Saint Bartholomew’s Church, which looks out over a rocky landscape of ever-changing colours. Wander its atmospheric streets, including Via Mormino Penna. It’s also worth visiting the town’s main square, Piazza Italia, which offer the perfect place to stop for a coffee and watch the world go by.\nJumping back on your bikes, you’ll pedal towards the Sicilian coast, riding past agricultural plots and scattered houses as you head to your destination for the evening; Pozzallo. Once on the coast, you’ll ride past long sandy beaches and the picturesque fishing hamlet of Sampieri (another Montalbano filming location). Your destination for the day, Pozzallo, is a town that’s famed for its clean beaches and crystal-clear water, offering the perfect end to a day of cycling.\n- Meals: Breakfast\n- Ascent: 250 Metres Approx.\nYour ride this morning will see you enjoying the Mediterranean coastal road to Capo Passero. The road will take you past vibrant waters and sandy beaches. As sections lead you inland, the riding will take you past marshland and lagoons, with a wide variety of bird life, such as herons, flamingos and storks. As you get closer to Capo Passero, the route will take you along tomato farm land, (now you know where your delicious sun ripened Sicilian tomatoes come from!)\nReaching the most southern point, facing the Isola delle Correnti, is going to be the highlight of the day. This is where the two seas, Ionian and Tyrrhenian meet, hence the name, island of currents.\nNestled between the turquoise waters of the Ionian Sea and the Mediterranean, the island is considered to have one of the most beautiful beaches in Sicily, as well as an impressive lighthouse. Cycling further along the coastal route, scattered with rustic Sicilian houses, you’ll ride through Portopalo di Capo Passero. Following the coast northwards, you’ll reach the quaint Marzamemi fishing hamlet with its colourful fishing boats moored up near the old fishermen’s houses. Marzamemi has an ancient tradition of Tuna fishing, still alive, and it’s here that you can taste some delicious products from the sea, such as Tuna Roe, smoked swordfish and marinated anchovies.\n- Meals: Breakfast\n- Ascent: 310 Metres Approx.\nLeaving Marzamemi, you’ll ride past the untouched Vendicari Natural Oasis, an area of great historical and scientific interest, that’s bursting with flora and fauna. Leaving your bikes secured at the park entrance, you’ll discover the reserve on foot, walking past lagoons filled with bird life.\nLeaving Vendicari, the riding picks up a little as you head for the characterful hill-top town of Noto, universally recognised as the Baroque capital city. Noto was completely rebuilt in the 17th Century, following an earthquake, taking on a whole new facade. Noto is a heady mix of opulent palaces and churches, juxtaposed with cosy courtyards. You’ll have the opportunity to explore this gorgeous town this evening, strolling down Corso Vittorio Emanuele with its imposing Cathedral, meandering the back streets lined with little restaurants and Pasticcerie. Enjoy indulging in some Sicilian specialties!\n- Meals: Breakfast\n- Ascent: 150 or 600 Metres Approx.\nLeaving Noto behind, you’ll begin your final day’s riding heading towards the coast through the wine region of Nero d‘Avola. The first section of the route will take you along quiet roads through cultivated orange groves and olive trees with the smells of Sicilian produce filling your senses.\nIn Avola you’ll be back on the coast, (how early is too early for a local wine tasting?)\nMoving on, keeping the coast on your left, you’ll ride through scattered summer-holiday residences alternating with sections of rocky coastline and cultivated fertile fields. After reaching Capo Murro at the far end of a promontory, you’ll loop back, with views opening up to the imposing Siracusa and Ortigia coastal town across the bay.\nYou’ll soon arrive at your final stop, Siracusa, the capital of Magna Grecia. Leaving your bikes at your accommodation, you can discover Siracusa’s centre; Ortigia where you can lose yourself in the winding, narrow streets as you dip in and out of craft shops. There’s also a good selection of bars and restaurants, offering the perfect opportunity to enjoy some tasty local fayre!\n- Meals: Breakfast\nToday you’ll be free to explore Siracusa at your leisure. It’s a city that has something for everyone, with lush citrus orchards, dazzling blue sea, classic Italian coffee shops and ancient Greek ruins! We recommend discovering the city’s rich past, which began when Corinthian colonists arrived in Sicily in 734 BC.\nMust-see sights include the ruins of the Temple of Apollo, the Duomo (built on what was the Greek temple to Athena), and the Fountain of Arethusa. If you fancy a spot of shopping, you can head to the traditional Ortigia Market, held every morning (excl.Sunday) where you can sample delicious Sicilian citrus fruits, limoncello and fresh fish.\nThe tour alternates between countryside and coastal views. You’ll be riding primarily on well-paved roads, except for a few short sections of dirt road. You’ll initially be riding in the Hybleaen mountains, with a bias of gentle downwards cycling through beautiful valleys, except for short sections leading to towns or to visit monuments.\nOnce on the coast you will be riding in a region which combines long flat stretches with very gentle hills, passing promontories, lagoons, tomato farms and orange groves. Coastal roads will overlook long stretches of sandy beaches and remote coves, as well as riding through stretches of towns and coastal villages.\nThe roads generally have little traffic, except for short sections of the route where you’ll ride on main roads to link up minor routes, and when entering and exiting bigger towns.\nWe recommend a hybrid bike for this tour.\nYou may notice more rubbish / litter than in other regions in Italy. This unfortunately is a governmental, political issue and the tourism sector are working with the government to find a solution to get this tidied up. That being said, you may find some sections of the route are littered a little more than others.\nLeisure Cycling Grade\nDistances generally between 15-30 miles / 24-48 kms per day\nFor those looking for an easy-going route\nMainly on the flat\nSome undulations and the odd cheeky challenge\nOur grading guidelines have been carefully created based on our many years of cycling experience, as well as customer feedback from our trips. Of course, if you're still struggling to figure out where you fit on the scale, do feel free to give us a quick call and we'll be more than happy to help!\nFor more information about our grading system click here.\nIs this suitable for you?\nMaybe you have recently got into cycling and would like to do more over consecutive days, or maybe you‘re looking for a more energetic alternative to your usual holiday? If you‘re looking for an opportunity to try some quiet roads, cycle paths or some accessible, cycle friendly routes these holidays might be for you. You’ll come across some gently undulating terrain and the odd cheeky challenge, so we’d generally expect those on a Grade 2 holiday to ride their bikes relatively frequently at home, perhaps commuting to work or heading out for some leisurely rides at the weekend.\nDates & Prices\nDaily departures available.

His Breeders’ Cup Juvenile (G1) scorer Texas Red is out of a mare by Jeune Homme, a Nureyev-line horse closely related to Storm Cat and Royal Academy, both also broodmare sires of Afleet Alex stakes winners. Afleet Alex sired 2-year-old Grade 1 winner Dublin out of a mare by Storm Bird, the sire of Storm Cat. From mares by other sons of Nijinsky II (sire of Royal Academy), Afleet Alex has stakes winners from daughters of Sky Classic and Strawberry Road.\nAfleet Alex has sired two stakes winners out of Danzig line mares, including Florida Derby (G1) victor Materiality out of a mare by Langfuhr. From the Dixieland Band branch of Northern Dancer, Afleet Alex has two stakes winners, including Grade 2 scorer Dancing Afleet, from mares by Citidancer (a clever cross here), suggesting daughters of Dixie Union might work well. Icecapade, a three-quarter relative to Northern Dancer, appears frequently in Afleet Alex’s good winners via either Wild Again or Clever Trick and his son Phone Trick.\nCrossing Afleet Alex back over Mr. Prospector has generally met with considerable success, with examples including the Travers Stakes (G1) hero Afleet Express out of a mare by Distant View and Grade 1 winner Sharla Rae out of a mare by Gold Fever, a son Forty Niner who appeals through Distorted Humor. Mr. Greeley, a son of Gone West, is the broodmare sire of Afleet Alex’s three-time Grade 1 winner Iotapa. Afleet Alex has two stakes winners out of mares by Kingmambo, a horse bred on a similar cross as Afleet Alex’s sire and himself sire of Lemon Drop Kid. From Mr. Prospector’s Fappiano branch, Afleet Alex has two stakes winners—including Grade 2 captress Afleeting Lady—out of Unbridled mares. From another branch of Raise a Native (the sire of Mr. Prospector) comes graded stakes winner La Gran Bailadora from a daughter of Affirmed.\nAfleet Alex’s dam is from the Roberto branch of the Hail to Reason line. Crossed back over a mare from that line, Afleet Alex sired graded stakes winner Called to Serve from a daughter of Kris S. (sire of Arch and grandsire of Blame, both of whom would be intriguing here). Afleet Alex already has two stakes winners, including graded scorer Bizzy Caroline, out of mares by Saint Ballado (brother to Devil’s Bag). We can note a stakes winner by Afleet Alex from a daughter of Rahy, whose dam, Glorious Song, is a sister to Saint Ballado.\nAfleet Alex also sired Grade 2 winner Harissa out of a daughter of Time for a Change and a stakes winner out of a mare by the similarly bred Gilded Time, both from the Damascus line.\nOur breeding shed will open Feb. 10, 2020.

Until 1920 that was a moot point, with a case to be reasonably made for several outstanding performers who had dominated their rivals in years gone by.\nBut the emergence of Man o’ War ended all debate. His almost flawless record and the manner of his accomplishments clearly marked him as the champion of champions. Nearly a century later there remains a body of opinion that still ranks him as best of the bests.\nThe creator of this paragon was August Belmont II, a fabulously wealthy New York financier who occupied a prominent – if not quite entirely dominant – position in racing and breeding circles over many years. He bred and raced both Fair Play, second-best in Colin’s generation, and Mahubah, just a maiden winner from five starts; he had imported Fair Play’s dam, Fairy Gold, and Mahubah’s dam, Merry Token, from England; and Mahubah was by England’s 1903 Triple Crown winner, Rock Sand, bought by Belmont for £25,000 to stand at his Nursery Stud in Kentucky.\nPick of the group from day one\nIn the normal course of events, the chestnut son of Fair Play and Mahubah who was born on 29 March 1917 would have raced in the colours of his breeder, but Belmont had a role to play for his nation after America’s entry into the Great War. He resolved to sell all his yearlings of 1918, albeit with some misgivings over the colt who had impressed as the pick of the group from day one. It would have looked bad to hold one back. The gangly youngster, who had already been named Man o’ War by Mrs Eleanor Belmont, would have to go to Saratoga with the others.\nThere were 21 in the Nursery Stud consignment, which sold for a highly satisfactory average of $2,450, more than double that for the sale as a whole. Although others were preferred by the market, Man o’ War made just over double the average for Belmont’s draft, knocked down for $5,000 to Ed Buhler, acting on behalf of (then) small-time operator Sam Riddle, who had hitherto been more conspicuous in the world of hunting and showing, but who had lately decided he wanted to establish a major flat racing stable.\nRiddle headed for Saratoga, aiming to collect up to a dozen yearlings, and he fancied himself as something of a judge. As it turned out, he did buy 11, and ten of them proved to be duds. He bid unsuccessfully well into five figures for two of the Nursery Stud lots, yet the acquisition who would ensure his life would never be the same again came at a significant discount.\nThere seems no doubt that Riddle bought Man o’ War at the insistence of noted horseman Louis Feustel, who had trained Mahubah and was currently training her Fair Play daughter Masda. Feustel accentuated all the positives he could summon to persuade Riddle to make the purchase. He was determined to add that tall, ungainly red chestnut colt to his string.\nMan o’ War wintered in Maryland before switching to New York in the spring of 1919. Feustel was in no hurry to introduce him to competition, but he soon recognised that there was something special about the long-striding colt.\nHe was not the only one to notice, and when Fair Play’s son went to post for his debut at Belmont on June 6, he was an odds-on chance against six rivals for a five-furlong maiden. Although jockey Johnny Loftus was easing him down towards the finish, the winning margin was six lengths. And Man o’ War would never start at odds against.\nAn opportunity to buy money\nBefore June was out, he was a four-time winner with three stakes victories to his name. The Keene Memorial (5½ furlongs, Belmont), the Youthful (5½ furlongs, Jamaica) and the Hudson (5 furlongs, Aqueduct) were collected with the minimum of fuss. In the last-named contest, he gave 21lb to his runner-up.\nMan o’ War remained at Aqueduct for a single start in July, when only two opposed him in the six-furlong Tremont Stakes. If concessions of 15lb to one and 18lb to the other were supposed to even things up a bit, the bettors did not take that view, sending him off at odds of 1-10, and he duly won with any amount in hand.\nFive easy wins from as many starts could hardly be faulted, but all New York recognised that Man o’ War had yet to contend with a worthy rival. The first serious tests would come in August at Saratoga, starting with the U S Hotel Stakes (six furlongs) on the second of the month.\nA field of ten went to post, the conditions stipulating that Man o’ War again had to give weight all round, and such was the apparent strength of the opposition that he started at 9-10, just a shade of odds-on. It proved an excellent opportunity to buy money, as the favourite held sway throughout and Loftus could afford to take things easily in the last half-furlong. Whisk Broom’s son, Upset, could make no impression as modest second-best, despite his 15lb weight concession.\nThe Thoroughbred Record’s reporter, while acknowledging that other promising youngsters may yet come along, was already prepared to award Man o’ War the 2-year-old title. He delivered a eulogy that acclaimed the colt’s superiority in pedigree, speed, stamina, size and class. There was none, he opined, who could threaten his dominance.\nHow many would have regarded such enthusiasm as a temptation to providence? Not many at Saratoga 11 days later, when Man o’ War went off at odds of 11-20 for the Sanford Memorial Stakes, in which he met Upset on the same terms and at the same distance as before.\nMan o’ War did not win the Sanford Memorial. He found himself hemmed in on the rail and got out just too late. His strong late charge testified to his gameness, but the aptly named Upset kept going stoutly to score by half a length. A crowd estimated at 20,000 saw it happen, but few accepted the result as a true representation of the principals’ merits. The Thoroughbred Record had little to say about Upset’s qualities; it referred to the runner-up as a ‘truly great racer’.\nOf course, no 2-year-old can ever be truly described as ‘great’, but Man o’ War would earn that designation in 1920, when he was required to prove that he was more than just a precocious sprinter, and he did so in a campaign of unparallelled brilliance.\nMeanwhile, he confirmed his dominance of the 1919 juvenile ranks, collecting easy victories in two more Saratoga stakes, the Grand Union Hotel and the Hopeful, and another back at Belmont in the Futurity. Upset was a well-beaten rival on all three occasions.\n‘No’ to the Kentucky Derby\nAlthough no official classification of 2-year-old performance would be published until 1933, a Daily Racing Form handicapper ranked Man o’ War an unprecedented 16 pounds above the best of his contemporaries.\nSam Riddle never doubted Man o’ War’s stamina, but he felt that early May was too soon for any 3-year-old to go a mile and a quarter, so he instructed Feustel not to aim his champion at the Kentucky Derby. Paul Jones beat Upset by a head in the Run for the Roses while Man o’ War waited for the Preakness, contested ten days later over nine furlongs.\nA 4-5 shot at Pimlico, with a new rider in Clarence Kummer, ‘Big Red’ won as he liked, conceding four pounds to Upset and defeating him by a length and a half, with Wildair (who received 12lb) a well-beaten third.\nBack at Belmont 11 days later for the Withers, Wildair faced a daunting task at level weights with Man o’ War, who trounced him by two lengths while setting an American record for the mile.\nThe 11 furlongs of the Belmont Stakes represented a new test for Man o’ War, but he had only one obviously inferior opponent and duly notched his second American record in a 20-length romp. It was all too easy again in the Stuyvesant Handicap at Jamaica, in which solitary rival Yellow Hand had the advantage of a 32-pound pull in the weights; Man o’ War toyed with the challenger, romping home by eight lengths at odds of 100-1 on.\nMan o’ War had his first serious test as a 3-year-old in the Dwyer Stakes at Aqueduct, for while he once more had only a single rival, that was a proper racehorse in the accomplished John P. Grier, whose trainer Jim Rowe held him in high esteem. His colt was to receive 18lb, which surely gave him a sporting chance.\nJohn P. Grier delivered an outstanding performance, matching Man o’ War stride for stride for more than a mile, even claiming a narrow lead at one point, but the last of the nine furlongs found him out, and he was a length and a half down at the finish. His gallant attempt forced the champion to set another American record in order to prevail.\nMan o’ War had two engagements at Saratoga, the first resulting in a facile triumph over Donnaconna in the Miller Stakes, when he was ridden by Earl Sande, replacing the injured Kummer. But, in the Travers, the colt needed another change of jockey, as Kummer remained out of action and Sande was unavailable, and both Upset (receiving six pounds) and John P. Grier (getting 14) could be considered worthy rivals. Jim Rowe, who handled both challengers, was bullish again.\nRowe soon realised that his optimism was misplaced. Man o’ War was away in a flash, remained on top throughout, and Andy Schuttinger, enjoying the luckiest spare ride of his career, was pulling him up as he passed the post in track record-equalling time.\nDerby hero no match\nNew York fans had only two more opportunities to see Man o’ War in action, and both produced bloodless victories. He started at 100-1 on in both the Lawrence Realization (13 furlongs) and the Jockey Club Stakes (12 furlongs), setting American records at both distances. His winning margins were recorded as 100 lengths and 15 lengths respectively.\nMan o’ War’s first serious training had been at Havre de Grace in Maryland, and it was there that he had his penultimate start in the Potomac Handicap over eight and a half furlongs. Hefty weight concessions to three rivals, including 24lb to Kentucky Derby hero Paul Jones, proved insufficient to create a meaningful race. The champion won in track record time.\nWhat was left for Man o’ War to prove? The one glaring omission from his record was a test against an older horse, and for some time Riddle had been under pressure to commit him to a match race against 4-year-old Sir Barton, the winner in 1919 of all the races that would later become bracketed together as the Triple Crown. Kenilworth Park, in Windsor, Canada, secured the honour of staging the event, putting up $75,000 and a $5,000 Gold Cup as prize for the winner.\nIt was a strange match with the favourite at 20-1 on, and it duly turned out to be an uncompetitive affair. Man o’ War soon bounded clear, always had matters all his own way, and won by seven lengths, knocking more than six seconds off the ten-furlong track record.\nMan o’ War remained sound and could have raced on at four, but he would have been assigned enormous weights in handicaps, so he retired as winner of 20 out of 21 starts, universally accepted as the greatest equine athlete in American history.\nWhat could he now contribute to the American thoroughbred through his genes?\nMan o’ War had 22 seasons at stud, all but the first two at Faraway Farm, near Lexington, and never covered a book greater than 25. He headed the North American sire list in 1926, when his oldest crop were only 4-year-olds, allowing the hope that there would be many more titles to come, but that proved to be his only season at the top. However, he ranked second three times and figured in the top ten on five other occasions.\nThat record might seem disappointing, but a tally of 17 per cent stakes-winners to foals – unheard of in the 21st century – tells a different story.\nMates of modest distinction\nIn truth, Man o’ War was a remarkably successful sire, particularly as the quality of his mates generally left a lot to to be desired. Riddle, friends and family did not own outstanding broodmare bands, but they routinely featured prominently among breeders with access to the horse. Commercial breeders who managed to buy nominations did rather well with the yearlings they marketed in the early years, but that did not last for obvious reasons. Between 1924 and 1943 a total of 45 yearlings went to auction, and only three contrived to win at stakes level.\nAs with Secretariat half a century later, too much was expected of Man o’ War at the outset of his stud career. It is widely recognised now that no truly exceptional racehorse can get a runner as good as himself, a fact explained by regression to the mean. Mates of modest distinction do not help.\nThere were winners of the Belmont Stakes in American Flag and Crusader from each of Man o’ War’s first two crops, but the sons who ultimately mattered most were products of his 13th and 17th crops – War Admiral and War Relic.\nWar Admiral famously won the 1937 Triple Crown and ingloriously turned in a feeble effort in his 1938 match against Seabiscuit, who was on all known form clearly his inferior.\nIn our book A Century of Champions, John Randall and I rated War Admiral only 5lb lower than his sire. He became an accomplished sire as well, and earned further celebrity as maternal grandsire of Buckpasser.\nWas he America’s greatest runner?\nWar Relic, the best of three stakes-winning full siblings, scored his biggest victory in the Massachusetts Handicap as a 3-year-old. His stud career proved inconsistent, but there were notable highlights in such as Battlefield, Intent and Relic, the last-named an important stud influence on both sides of the Atlantic.\nMan o’ War covered his last mares in 1942 and afterwards was a much-visited pensioner at Faraway Farm, where he died on 1 November 1947.\nSuch was Man o’ War’s enduring reputation that in 1999 a panel of authorities brought together by The Blood-Horse added to his legend by honouring him as America’s all-time best runner.\nJohn Randall and I took a different view. While recognising him as a performer who had plainly surpassed the achievements of all his predecessors, we believed that the American Thoroughbred had made significant progress since the 1920s, and in our book Secretariat ranked clear best.\nAlso in this series"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1bc3bb20-922b-4d88-82fd-89b7dcb7713e>","<urn:uuid:26b977b7-0b56-4150-9b29-a9bd17886b85>"],"error":null}

But it’s not that difficult if you have the right tools and materials, as well as knowledge of the proper techniques. And the best place to find everything you need for your project, as well as the necessary know-how, is at your local independent home improvement retailer.\nToday, I’m going to show you how to fix holes in your wall, whether they are small, medium or large in size. First, we’ll show you how to assess the situation and determine what type of patch you’ll need. Then we’ll teach you the proper techniques to make it look like nothing ever happened in the first place. So let’s get started.\nTo fix a hole in your wall generally requires some type of patch to cover the hole, whether it is a metal patch like the one I’m holding here, or another piece of drywall like this. In addition to the patch, you need drywall patching compound to smooth out the patch and a putty knife to spread the drywall compound over the patch. Be sure to check out the Tools and Materials Checklist for everything you’ll need. You may also want to pull up our list of Frequently Asked Questions for this project before you get started.\nThe most common type of drywall repair actually doesn’t require a patch. It involves fixing a small hole. For this type of repair, you first need to clean out the hole with a blade knife, angling your cut to make the front of the hole larger than the back. This will give the compound more surface to adhere to.\nNext, fill the hole with drywall compound or painter’s putty using a putty knife to smooth it out, and make it level with the wall surface. Let it dry and sand it smooth. In this step we’re using a lightweight spackling that goes on pink and turns white when it’s dry, which lets you know it’s ready for sanding. Whether you’re using drywall compound, spackling or painters’ putty, they all have a tendency to shrink as they dry, so you will need to repeat the process several times before the hole is properly filled.\nThe easiest way to repair a medium-size hole in drywall is to use an adhesive-backed metal patch. These come in various sizes depending on the size of the hole you’re trying to fix. To start this repair, first sand the surface smooth around the hole so the adhesive mesh will easily stick to the surface of the wall. After you’re finished sanding, wipe off any dust.\nNext, peel the paper backing off the back of the patch and place it over the hole so that the mesh surface faces outward. Firmly press the patch in place around the edges of the hole.\nUsing a putty knife, spread drywall compound over the entire patch, feathering out the edges beyond the patch onto the wall. Allow the compound to dry and sand it smooth. Then repeat the process, each time spreading it a little further out from the edges of the patch.\nSmoothing out the edges of the drywall compound flush with the surface of the wall is called feathering. The wider you feather out the edges from the edge of the patch, the smoother the end result will be.\nKeep in mind that to get a smooth finish, it takes repeating the process two or maybe even three times, letting it dry and sanding it smooth between each step. The key is to be patient. You don’t want to apply too much compound, or sand too much away, in any one step. The patching process is complete when you have a smooth finish, and when the patch can’t be detected.\nLarger holes in a wall require a patch made of drywall, which is also commonly referred to as wall board or gypsum board. The key to this type of repair is to make sure your drywall patch is the same thickness as the drywall used in your wall. The drywall in most homes is ½-inch thick. But double check the thickness of your existing drywall before heading to your local independent home improvement retailer. This is one time when it’s handy to have a hole in the wall.\nNow it’s time to cut a patch. First, cut a piece of drywall that is slightly larger than the hole you are trying to repair. Even a piece of scrap drywall will work, as long as it has straight edges. To cut the drywall, you can either cut it with the drywall saw or use a blade knife to score and snap it, scoring the front using the blade knife and a straight edge, then snapping it in two pieces. You’ll also need to score the back along the snap line.\nNext, place the drywall patch over the hole in the wall and trace the shape on the wall with a pencil. Be sure to check for any electrical wires or plumbing lines that might be located behind the wall where you will be cutting. If there are no electrical or plumbing lines present, use a drywall saw to punch a hole through the drywall along your line. Then cut out the shape you traced. If electrical wires or plumbing lines are present, you may want to call an electrician or a plumber as a precautionary measure.\nThe trick to this repair is screwing wooden cleats, like these, inside the hole along the edges. They need to be longer than the width of the hole. Place some construction adhesive on the ends of the cleats before screwing them to the hole using drywall screws. Be careful that the screws don’t break the paper surface of the drywall. You only want the screw to dimple the drywall like you see here.\nNow, screw your drywall patch to the wooden cleats, again being careful not to break the drywall’s paper coating.\nApply a thin layer of drywall compound to the seams and cover with mesh tape, bedding the tape in the drywall compound. Then apply some more drywall compound to completely cover the tape. Let it dry, then apply more drywall compound, feathering the edges as you go. Like we did for the patches we discussed earlier, it will take several coats, as well as a light sanding, between each coat. This is how to achieve a smooth finish that is virtually undetectable.\nAll you have to do now is prime the patch using a drywall primer then paint the patch to match the existing wall color. If you don’t have paint to match, be sure to watch our video on selecting the right type of paint. There you have it. That’s how to make an unsightly hole in your wall disappear before your very eyes.\nIf you have questions about this or any other home improvement project, be sure to read our list of Frequently Asked Questions for this video. And be sure to print out our Project Instructions, which includes a Tools and Materials checklist, before visiting your local independent home improvement retailer.

{"question":"How did ancient civilizations develop dome architecture when they lacked wood for construction?","answer":"In regions lacking wood, such as Assyria, or in areas where people lacked tools to work wood, builders were compelled to construct using stone, brick, or mud. In these circumstances, they had to devise dome or tunnel vault structures for shelter. This primitive form of dome and barrel vault construction is of great antiquity, developed out of necessity for creating covered structures without wooden materials.","context":["Dome (Lat. domus, a house), an architectural term often used synonymously with cupola. Strictly speaking it signifies the external part of a spherical or polygonal covering of a building, of which the Cupola (q.v.) is the inner structure, but in general usage dome means the entire covering. It is also loosely used, as in the German Dom and Italian Duomo, to designate a cathedral, or, at times, to signify some other building of importance. A dome may be of any material, wood, stone, metal, earthenware, or it may be built of a single mass or of a double or even triple series of concentric coverings. The dome is a roof, the base of which is a circle, an ellipsis, or a polygon, and its vertical section a curved line, concave towards the interior. Hence domes are called circular, elliptical or polygonal, according to the figure of the base. The most usual form is the spherical, in which case its plan is a circle, the section a segment of a circle. Domes are sometimes semi-elliptical, pointed, often in curves of contrary flexure, bell-shaped, etc. Except in the earlier period of the development of the dome, the interior and exterior forms were not often alike, and, in the space between, a staircase to the lantern was generally made.\nDomes are of two kinds, simple and compound. In the simple dome, the dome and the pendentives are in one, and the height is only a little greater than that of an intersecting vault formed by semicircular arches. The dome over the central part of the tomb of Galla Placidia, at Ravenna, and those over some of the aisles of Saint Sophia, Constantinople, are of this description. In the compound dome two methods were followed. In both methods greater height is obtained, and the compound dome was consequently the one used on all important buildings of the later period. In one, the dome starts directly from the top of the circle formed by the pendentives; in the other, a cylindrical wall or “drum” intervenes between the pendentives and the dome, thus raising the latter considerably. In churches with domes without drums, the windows are in the dome itself immediately above the springing; otherwise, they are in the drum, and the surface of the dome is generally unbroken. At the monastery of St. Luke, Phocis, Greece, are two churches of the eleventh century, side by side, the smaller of which has a drum with windows in it, whereas the larger church has no drum, and the windows are in the dome. The drum is universal in all domed churches of the Renaissance, at which time it received special treatment and became a most important feature. Many of these drums are not circular in plan externally, but are many-sided, and the angles are often enriched by marble shafts, etc. The carrying-up of the walls vertically is a good expedient constructionally, as it provides weight above the haunches of the dome and helps to neutralize its thrusts. In the churches of the second period, at Constantinople, Salonica, Athens, and other parts of Greece, in which the true drum occurs, it is of considerable height and is generally eight-sided. Windows come at each side, and over the windows are arches which cut into the dome itself.\nA primitive form of the dome and the barrel vault is of great antiquity. In some districts men were compelled to build in stone or brick or mud, because there was no wood, as in Assyria; in other districts because they had not the tools to work wood. In all such cases some form of dome or tunnel vault had to be devised for shelter. In tracing the growth of the dome in historical times, it has been regarded as an outcome of the architecture of the Eastern Empire, because it was at Constantinople and in the Byzantine provinces that it was first employed in ecclesiastical structures. But it was the Romans who in reality developed the use of the dome, as of all other applications of the semicircular arch. From Rome it was carried to Constantinople and from the same source to different parts of the Western Empire. In Eastern Christendom the dome became the dominant factor in church design; whether a single dome, as at Saint Sophia, Constantinople (built, 532-537), or a central dome encircled by other domes, as at St. Mark’s, Venice, or a row of domes, as at Angouleme. The plan and domes of Angouleme are reproduced in the new Catholic cathedral at Westminster. The Roman dome was a hemisphere supported by a circular wall. Its finest example was the Pantheon, Rome. Equally characteristic, though smaller, examples abound, e.g. at Rome, the temple of Minerva Medica, the tomb of Constantia, now the church of Santa Costanza, etc. Viollet-le-Duc in writing of the dome of the Pantheon says, “This majestic cupola is the widest, the most beautiful, the best constructed, and most stable of all the great domes of the world”. The inside diameter of the dome is 1421 feet. Previous to the building of the Pantheon in its present domical form, during the reign of Hadrian about A.D. 123, the history of the dome is for the most part a blank.\nThe primitive Eastern dome seems to have been on a very small scale, and to have been used for subordinate purposes only. It was a common architectural feature in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. In later times the dome was largely employed in architecture by the Persian Sassanids, Mohammedans, and the Byzantines. From the first domed churches built for Christian worship sprang Byzantine architecture and its offshoots. The builder of the earliest domed church of any magnitude was Constantine; its locality the famous city of Antioch in Syria. The problem of the Christian domed church, so far at least as its interior is concerned, received in Saint Sophia its full solution. The dome is the prevailing conception of Byzantine architecture, and M. Choisy, in his “Art de batir chez lea Byzantins” traces the influence of this domical construction on Greek architecture to show how from their fusion the architecture of the Eastern Empire became possible. Domes were now, from the time of the construction of Saint Sophia, placed over square apartments, their bases being brought to a circle by means of pendentives, whereas, in Roman architecture, domes as a rule were placed over a circular apartment. The grouping of small domes round a large central one was very effective, and one of the peculiarities of Byzantine churches was that the dome had no additional outer covering. The dome was rarely used by medieval builders except when under oriental influence, hence it was practically confined to Spain and Italy. The dome of the cathedral at Pisa, the first model of the Tuscan style of architecture, was begun in the eleventh century, and in the thirteenth was founded the cathedral at Florence. Its dome equals in size that of St. Peter’s at Rome, and was its model. During the Italian Renaissance, domed construction became again of the first importance, possibly on account of its classical precedent, and it is interesting to note that the Pantheon became once more the starting-point of a new development which culminated in the domes of St. Peter’s, Rome, and St. Paul’s, London.\nThe substructure of the dome of St. Peter’s is a round drum, which serves as a stylobate and lifts it above the surrounding roofs. On this stands the ringwall of the drum, decorated with a Corinthian order and carrying an attic; on this sits the oval mass of the noblest dome in the world. The drum, fifty feet high, is pierced by sixteen square-headed windows. The enormous thickness of the stylobate allows an outside offset to receive the buttresses which are set between the windows, in the shape of spur-walls with engaged columns at the corners, over which the entablature is broken. The curve of the dome is of extraordinary beauty. Between its ribs, corresponding to the buttresses below, are three diminishing tiers of small dormer windows. The lantern above, with an Ionic order, repeats the arrangement of windows and buttresses in the drum below, and is surmounted by a Latin cross rising 448 feet above the pavement. The foremost Renaissance church in Florence is the church of the Annunziata, and is remarkable for a fine dome carried on a drum resting directly on the ground. To the latest time of the Renaissance in Venice belongs the picturesque domed church of Santa Maria della Salute. The two finest domes in France are those of the Hotel des Invalides and the Pantheon (formerly the church of Sainte-Genevieve) at Paris. Domes built in the early part of the twelfth century are to be found at Valencia, Zamora, Salamanca, Clermont, Le Puy, Cahors.\nThey are also found in Poitou, Perigord, and Auvergne; at Aachen, Cologne, Antwerp, and along the banks of the Rhine; at Aosta, Pavia, Como, Parma, Piacenza, Verona, Milan, etc. There are, besides, the bulbous domes of Russia and the flattened cupolas of the Saracens. The dome became the lantern in English Gothic, and the octagon of Ely cathedral is said to be the only true Gothic dome in existence. The central octagon of the Houses of Parliament, London, is the best specimen of a modern Gothic dome. Arab domes are mostly of the pointed form such as are derived from the rotation of the Gothic arch or bulbous, the section being a horse-shoe arch. Very beautiful examples are seen in the buildings known as the tombs of the caliphs at Cairo. Among the finest examples of domed buildings in the East are the Tombs of Mohammedan sultans in the south of India and at Agra. The largest dome in America is that of the Capitol at Washington. It is built of iron.\nTHOMAS H.

{"question":"What's the difference between cleavage and fracture when examining minerals and gemstones?","answer":"Cleavage occurs only in certain directions where atoms are more loosely bound, resulting in smooth, clean breaks that can appear polished. In contrast, fracture can occur in any direction and represents breaks that don't follow cleavage planes. For example, tourmalines, sapphires, and garnets do not show cleavage, while minerals like fluorite show perfect cleavage in four directions. When it comes to fracture patterns, they can vary - turquoise shows granular fracture while coral shows uneven fracture.","context":["In the Name of Allahwho is the Master of life and death\nIntroduction to Gemology andPhysical Properties of Gemstone\nIntroduction to Gemology• Gemology (gemmology) is the science, art and profession of identifying and evaluating gemstones. It is considered a geoscienc and a branch of mineralogy.• Gemology is the study of gemstones. Some dictionaries define it as the “scientific study of gemstones,” but it is almost impossible to remove the scientific element. There are many categories of gemologists. For the jeweler it is a key element of their business. They need to be able to answer their customer’s questions and identify the gems brought into them.• Some jewelers are academically trained gemologists and are qualified to identify and evaluate gems.\nGemstone• A gem is a natural, mineral or organic substance, that has substantial beauty, rarity, and durability .\nNatural Gemstone• Natural means that the material was not made, or assisted in its making, by human effort.\nMineral Gemstone• A mineral can be defined as a crystalline solid with a specific chemical formula, and a regular three dimensional arrangement of atoms. for example, opal and natural types of glass. [Faceted iolite, uncut emerald crystal]\nOrganic Gemstone• An organic gem is one that was made by living things, present or past. Examples include pearls, coral, jet, ivory, shell and amber. Such gems consist of the molecules formed by the organism, although these molecules may have been altered somewhat due to compression or other geological or chemical forces. [Organic gems: coral and freshwater cultured pearl earrings, faceted amber (enlargement showing fossilized insect within the gem]\nPhysical Properties of Gemstones• Properties of Gemstones: There are two sets of characteristics possessed by every gemstone, and by which they are studied, identified and evaluated: – 1) physical properties – 2) optical properties.\nPhysical Properties• Although there are a dozen or more physical properties which can be measured, in this course we will concentrate on just a few. In particular, our focus will be on those which are either visible directly, or measurable with minimal equipment, and those which are most important as indicators of a gems identity, and/or its suitability for particular uses:\nPhysical Properties• 1 Cleavage: In the three dimensional structure of certain crystals, atoms are bound more tightly to each other in some directions and more loosely in others. As a consequence, when strong forces are applied, relatively clean breaks may occur in these \"weakest link\" directions. These breaks, which can sometimes be so smooth as to appear to have been polished, are called cleavages.\nPhysical Properties• Not all gems show cleavage however, for example tourmalines, sapphires, and garnets do not. [Apatite: two, imperfect (note that cleaved surfaces are somewhat rounded and irregular); spodumene: two, perfect (note extremely flat, smooth breaks), fluorite: four, perfect]\nPhysical Properties• 2 Fracture: Whereas cleavages occur only in some gems, and within those, only in certain directions, fractures can, and do, occur in all gems, and in any direction. A fracture is a break which is not along a cleavage plane [Turquoise: granular, coral: uneven]\nPhysical Properties• 3 Hardness: The tendency to resist scratching in a gem is known as its hardnessMoh’s Scale of Hardness: Hardness Mineral Absolute Hardness 1 Talc (Mg3Si4O10(OH)2) 1 2 Gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O) 2 3 Calcite (CaCO3) 9 4 Fluorite (CaF2) 21 5 Apatite (Ca5(PO4)3(OH-,Cl-,F-) 48 6 Orthoclase Feldspar (KAlSi3O8) 72 7 Quartz (SiO2) 100 8 Topaz (Al2SiO4(OH-,F-)2) 200 9 Corundum (Al2O3) 400 10 Diamond (C) 1500\nPhysical Properties[Talc, the softest on the Mohs scale, diamond, the hardest]\nPhysical Properties• 4 Toughness: The tendency to resist breaking and chipping is known as a gems toughness.• This property is controlled primarily by two factors: the readiness of a material to cleave in single crystal gems, and the presence or absence of certain structural characteristics in aggregate\nPhysical Properties• 5 Stability: Stability in a gem is a measure of its ability to resist changes due to exposure to light, heat and/or chemicals.• 6 Dehydration: Heat is a factor that can create problems with certain gems. In some cases, the mineral comprising the gem is \"hydrated\", that is, it contains water molecules which adhere chemically with varying degrees of tenacity.\nPhysical Properties• 7 Light: Some gems can fade or change color when exposed to light. An extreme example of this phenomenon is seen in the rare mineral pyrargyrite which must be kept constantly under opaque covers or else light exposure quickly renders its originally red color completely black.\nPhysical Properties• 8 Specific Gravity: Specific gravity, also known as relative density, differs widely among gemstones, and is one of their most important physical characteristics from the viewpoint of gem identification. Specific gravity (SG) is the ratio of the weight of one unit volume of the gem to the weight of the same unit of water. For example, to say sapphire (corundum) has SG = 4.0, means precisely that a cubic inch of sapphire weighs four times as much as a cubic inch of water","EARTH SCIENCE LAB\nMineral Physical Properties and Identification\nMinerals are defined as naturally occurring, inorganic, solids with a definite chemical composition and a regular, internal crystalline structure. The keys to this definition are the chemical composition and the crystalline structure. Different chemical compositions result in different minerals. A good example is the mineral plagioclase. Plagioclase is a member of the feldspar group, but there is more than one type of plagioclase. Albite and anorthite are two examples. Albite has a chemical composition of NaAlSi3O8, while anorthite's chemical composition is CaAl2Si2O8. Very similar, but different - therefore two different minerals.\nDifferent crystalline structures, or how the atoms and molecules are arranged, result in different minerals. A good example is diamond and graphite. Both minerals are composed of carbon (C). The same chemical composition, but two different crystalline structures - therefore, two different minerals.\nDetermination of the actual chemical composition and crystalline structure of a mineral is difficult without the proper equipment. In an introductory level lab it is impossible for us to determine these two aspects of a mineral. Fortunately, these two aspects determine a mineral's physical properties. How the atoms and molecules are arranged and the strength of the bonding between the atoms result in different physical properties for different minerals. While many minerals share common physical properties, when all of a mineral's physical properties are examined, it often results in a unique set of physical properties which can be used to identify the mineral.\nBelow you will find a chart which defines the physical properties and provides the means for determining the physical property of a mineral sample. These definitions and methods are simplified. Consult your lab manual for detailed discussion.\n|Mineral Physical Properties Chart|\n|Cleavage||Breakage of a mineral along planes of weakness in the crystal structure.||Examine the mineral for areas where the mineral is broken. Look for areas where the light reflects from planar surfaces. This can be easily confused with a crystal face and is the most difficult properties for students to master.|\n|Color||Visible light spectrum radiation reflected from a mineral.||Look at the sample and determine its color - white, black, green, clear, etc.|\n|Crystal Form||Geometric shape of a crystal or mineral.||Examine and describe the geometric shape of the mineral - cubic, hexagonal, etc. Not commonly seen in most introductory lab samples.|\n|Fracture||Breakage of a mineral, not along planes of weakness in the crystral structure.||Examine the mineral for areas where the mineral is broken. Describe the breakage as either irregular or conchoidal (has the appearance of broken glass)|\n|Hardness||Resistance to scratching or abrasion.||Use minerals of known hardness from the Mohs Hardness Kits. Scratch the unknown mineral with a known hardness to determine which mineral is harder. Continue doing this with harder or softer minerals from the kit until the hardness is determined.|\n|Luster||Character of the light reflected by a mineral.||Look at the sample to determine if the mineral is metallic in appearance (looks like a chunk of metal) or non-metallic (doesn't look like a chunk of metal).|\n|Magnetism||Electromagnetic force generated by an object or electrical field.||Use a magnet to determine if the magnet is attracted to the sample.|\n|Reaction to HCl||Chemical interaction of hydrochloric acid and calcium carbonate (CaCO3).||Place one small drop of HCl on a sample a watch for a reaction - effervesces (bubbles).\nClick here to see an short animation (351 Kb)\n|Specific Gravity||Ratio of the mass of a mineral to the mass of an equal volume of water.||Generally not determined in an introductory lab.

These are not commonly tested for in an introductory lab.|\nBelow is a table listing some of the aspects of the common lab minerals. This table is not a complete listing of all of the physical properties for each mineral. It is designed to highlight those physical properties that are unique to that mineral or assist in identification of that mineral. Be aware that not all mineral samples will necessarily show these physical properties. For example, all plagioclase has cleavage. The sample you examine may or may not show that cleavage. All minerals have a crystal form. However, rarely do introductory mineral samples show a good crystal form. Some types of minerals rarely show a crystal form and even museum collections may not contain good examples of a mineral's crystal form.\n|Mineral Identification - Diagnostic Physical Properties|\n|Apatite||Green color, H=5, may show hexagonal crystal form|\n|Augite||Dark or dull green color, 2 cleavages at ~90 degrees, similar properties to Hornblende|\n|Biotite||Black color, one perfect direction of cleavage resulting in the mineral pealing into thin, flexible sheets, similar properties to Muscovite|\n|Calcite||H=3, reacts with HCl, 3 directions of cleavage (rhombic cleavage)|\n|Corundum||H=9, often shows hexagonal crystal form|\n|Dolomite||Reacts to HCL in its powdered form, similar properties to calcite|\n|Fluorite||H=4, 4 directions of cleavage, often purple in color (can be white, clear, yellow, green)|\n|Galena||Gray, metallic mineral, 3 directions of cleavage (cubic)|\n|Garnet||Typically reddish brown color, no cleavage, commonly found in twelve-sided crystals (dodecahedrons)|\n|Graphite||\"Pencil lead\", soft metallic mineral, gray streak|\n|Gypsum||H=2, can be scratched with a fingernail|\n|Halite||\"Salt\", H=2.5, cannot be scratched with a fingernail, 3 directions of cleavage (cubic), salty taste|\n|Hematite||Reddish brown streak, \"rust\"|\n|Hornblende||Black to dk. green color, 2 directions of cleavage at 120 or 60 degrees, similar properties to Augite|\n|Magnetite||Magnetic, metallic mineral|\n|Muscovite||Clear or translucent color, one perfect direction of cleavage resulting in the mineral pealing into thin, flexible sheets, similar properties to Biotite|\n|Olivine||Apple green or yellowish green color, H=7 (often difficult to determine), conchoidal fracture, no cleavage|\n|Orthoclase||H=6, salmon pink color is typical, perthitic intergrowths are common, 2 directions of cleavage at 90 degrees, similar properties to plagioclase|\n|Plagioclase||H=6, white or gray color, striations may be seen on cleavage surface, 2 directions of cleavage at 90 degrees, similar properties to orthoclase|\n|Pyrite||\"Fool's Gold\", gold metallic color|\n|Quartz||H=7, conchoidal fracture, no cleavage, color is typically white or clear but can be pink, red, purple, black|\n|Sulfur||Yellow color, \"rotten egg\" smell if burned|\n|Talc||H=1, very soft, easily scratched by fingernail|\nOn each of the following pages you will find an image of a mineral and a series of physical properties tests.

{"question":"What was Joop Beek's controversial role in Indonesia during the aftermath of the 1965 coup?","answer":"Joop Beek acted as a militant Red-hater and advisor to President Soeharto, trained student activists supporting the Indonesian Army, and worked as a spy providing Western intelligence operatives with information about events in Jakarta during the months following the September 30, 1965 coup, when approximately 500,000 real or suspected Communists were killed.","context":["Adolf Heuken’s publishing experiences offer a droll comment on the interests of Indonesian and expat readers.\nThe prolific writer produced scores of books during his 55-year career, which ended eight days after his 90th birthday, late last month.\nHe spent most of his time in Jakarta where he built a reputation as the foremost historian of the nation’s capital and its cityscape. In his book-filled Menteng study late last year I asked about his most popular title.\nWas it Historical Sites of Jakarta, or Deutsch-Indonesisches Worterbuch – Kamus Jerman-Indonesia the German-Indonesia dictionary, first published in the 1980s and still in print? Or perhaps even Mesjid-mesjid tua di Jakarta, a catalogue of old mosques in the capital compiled by a Catholic, primarily for Muslims?\n“None of these,” he replied, slowly shuffling his walking frame from a high desk; he worked in a semi-upright position after suffering with back problems, though his mind stayed sharp, “it’s this – Ensiklopedi Orang Kudus (Encyclopedia of Saints) and its spin-offs,” gesturing to a row of small booklets, each one featuring a name.\nFor a serious scholar working in his adopted land these books were a sideshow. Yet they are still popular and sought after by expectant Catholic and Protestant parents seeking ideas for their offspring’s name, its origins, and associations. They’re also purchased as presents by well-wishers for religious junctures in a child’s life, like christenings and first communion.\nBut the German-born Jesuit who arrived in this country in 1963, and later became an Indonesian citizen, is most likely to be remembered by Indonphiles for his well-illustrated coffee-table books on the old buildings of the city, once known as Batavia.\nIn many cases his records are the only ones easily accessible; rock drills and backhoes have smashed to rubble so many old and gracious buildings, as developers with more money than taste compete to build higher and more garish apartment blocks and shopping malls. When lost for ideas they have a line of galloping horses at the entrance to disguise the rows of stables at the rear masquerading as houses.\nHowever, a new generation of architects and landscape artists, aware that the public hankers for buildings with character and sober standout qualities, have Heuken’s work for inspiration. This is his legacy and the future Jakarta will be richer as a result.\nHeuken was born in Coesfeld in North Rhine-Westphalia, near the university city of Münster, where he planned to become a monk. Instead, he studied to enter the Society of Jesus, the Catholic congregation mainly favoured by intellectuals. His interest was always history and this began to flower as Jakarta developed.\nA skilled linguist, he wrote in German, Indonesian, and English. He could also read and write in Dutch, which he said was essential for anyone trying to understand the history of the archipelago.\nFollowing the 1965 coup, Heuken became concerned with the activities of a fellow Jesuit, Joop Beek (1917-1983). Heuken alleged the Amsterdam-born priest who came to Indonesia before the war, and was imprisoned first by the Japanese and then by Javanese militia who thought him a colonialist, was straying far from his ministry.\nBeek had moved from Yogyakarta, where he was teaching, to Jakarta; in the capital he became a militant Red-hater and advisor to second President Soeharto. Beek trained student activists backing the Indonesian Army and doubled as a spy, telling Western intelligence operatives of events in Jakarta during the months after the September 30, 1965 coup, when an estimated 500,000 real or imagined Communists were killed.\nHeuken was so worried by his colleague’s partisanship that he wrote to the Vatican and for a while Beek was withdrawn from Indonesia.\nDr Grace Pamungkas, who co-wrote two books with Heuken before moving to New Zealand for her doctorate, said she was blessed that she’d met Heuken at a seminar in 1998 when studying architecture. He offered her work as a researcher and she later became an author.\n“I have learned to be super critical about the originality of references when they’ve been acknowledged and formally recognised in public, or even in scientific forums,” she said. “In so many ways we have to check to make sure we are using the most original information about any historical event, or someone’s life, or a building before we publish.\n“A favourite phrase which he used in English was “a city without old buildings is like a man without a memory.” He also quoted first President Soekarno: ‘Jangan sekali-kali meninggalkan sejarah” – never forget the past.\n“I hope I’m not biased when I say he’s the only Indonesian historian readers can trust in presenting historical works based on the best available original sources.”\n“Sometimes he seemed like a senior doctor who’d know of something wrong in another doctor’s report or a medical journal. He got angry when he found misinformed writing on Indonesian history – which was almost every day. But through this frustration he maintained his principle of always producing high-quality work.”\nHeuken was disciplined; a habit enforced by his parents when he was a child. He started each day with Mass in a Menteng chapel at Jalan Prof Muh Yamin before opening his books at 8 am and working through till 1.30 in the afternoon. He’d return to reading and writing later in the day and often stayed studying into the night.\nHis research included visiting sites, questioning occupiers and trying to find previous owners.\nIn 2008 Heuken received the Das Bundesverdienstkreuz am Bande award (Star of the German Federal Republic) for his work in developing German-Indonesian relations. It’s the highest German Government recognition for a layperson’s service to the State."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:12733bb0-5dde-4d85-9963-815d22f38e79>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is the relationship between El Niño events and seasonal climate patterns, with specific focus on their impact on fire risks in peatland forests and precipitation in California?","answer":"El Niño events significantly affect global weather patterns by altering ocean temperatures and atmospheric conditions. In Central Kalimantan's peatland forests, El Niño conditions (like those in 2015 and 2019) lead to increased fire risks, causing massive wildfires that burned 317,749 hectares in 2019 alone. High water levels during La Niña phases help reduce fire risks in peat-swamp forests. In California, strong El Niño events typically bring increased winter rainfall, particularly in the southern part of the state. This was especially evident during the 1997-1998 El Niño, which brought unrelenting rains and caused destructive mudslides. However, the exact impacts can vary due to other climate factors, and even strong El Niños don't guarantee specific weather patterns, as demonstrated by the 2009-2010 event which had different effects due to other climate signals.","context":["El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) refers to the cycle of warm and cold Sea Surface Temperatures (SST) of the tropical central and eastern Pacific Ocean. These warm and cold phases are known as El Niño, and La Niña, respectively. El Niño events typically come around every 3-7 years (~5 years on average) and can last between nine months to two years. The most recent El Niño occurred in 2018-2019, bringing with it a lack of rainfall that plunged parts of Indonesia into extreme drought.\nSince the start of 2023, Central Kalimantan in Indonesian Borneo has been experiencing intense rain accompanied by strong winds and thunderstorms. According to the Central Kalimantan Meteorology, Climatology and Geophysics Agency (BMKG – Indonesian acronym), we are currently experiencing a weak La Niña, though this is soon predicted to give way to more neutral conditions lasting into the mid-year.\n“In the second half of 2023, we will see either a continuation of ENSO Neutral conditions or a switch to El Niño. The chance of either occurring (relative to the other) is less than 60% in both cases, although there is a slightly greater likelihood of El Niño,” revealed forecaster Muhamad Ihsan Sidiq via online message.\nIhsan explained that these climactic shifts affect weather patterns around the globe, not just in the tropical Pacific where ENSO originates.\nIn 2015 and 2019, severe El Niño conditions gave rise to massive wildfires in Central Kalimantan. In 2019 alone, 317,749 hectares of land were burned across the province, including critical forest habitat. One of the affected areas is the riverside Peat Forest Natural Laboratory (LAHG – Indonesian acronym), a special zone within the Sebangau National Park.\nTo prepare for fire outbreaks in the event of another El Niño later this year, routine monitoring activities are being carried out across the most fire-prone areas. The Center for International Cooperation in Sustainable Management of Tropical Peatland (CIMTROP), which lies within the University of Palangka Raya (UPR), joined forces with Borneo Nature Foundation (BNF) Indonesia to conduct patrols in the LAHG.\nThe CIMTROP Patrol Team Coordinator, Kitso Kusin, said that this year has seen a flurry of activity in anticipation of the next El Niño. To facilitate better access for emergency firefighters, the nearby river was cleared of pandan leaves and other organic debris which had built up, blocking several points of entry into the forest by boat.\n“Besides their role in firefighting and prevention, our patrols around the LAHG also help to deter illegal loggers from operating in this area,” he continued.\nAlthough the team’s capacity is growing, they have yet to secure all the equipment needed to fight fire outbreaks on the scale seen in 2015 and 2019. Existing equipment will also require maintenance over the next few months to make sure everything is in full working order and ready to go should the team be called to an emergency response.\nHigh water levels (like those associated with the current La Niña) greatly reduce the risk of fires in peat-swamp forests. We hope that the forest will remain waterlogged, and that our efforts can secure another fire-free year in the LAHG, despite the potential for El Niño.\nWritten by Yohanes Prahara, BNF’s Content Creator and Media Liaison","It was the winter of 1997-1998 when the granddaddy of El Ninos - the one by which all other El Ninos are judged - vaulted the climate term to household name status. It had such a noticeable impact on U.S. weather that it appeared everywhere from news coverage of mudslides in Southern California to Chris Farley's legendary sketch on \"Saturday Night Live.\" Basically, it was the \"polar vortex\" of the late ‘90s.\nSo it's no wonder that it is the touchstone event that people think of when they hear that name. And naturally, as the current El Nino event has gained steam, the comparisons to 1997 have been increasingly bandied about.\n16 U.S. Weather Photos That Will Amaze You\nThe most recent came this week in the form of an image from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that compares satellite shots of warm Pacific Ocean waters - a hallmark of El Nino - from this June to November 1997, when that El Nino hit its peak.\nOn the one hand, the two are comparable given that 1997 was the strongest El Nino on record and, at the moment, the best science indicates that the current event could match or rival that one - at least in terms of ocean temperatures. But on the other hand, each El Nino event is its own beast, the product of conditions in the ocean and atmosphere, of climate and weather that are unique in that particular place and time.\nIn the, albeit very short, modern record of El Ninos, \"we cannot find a single El Nino event that tracked like another El Nino event,\" Michelle L'Heureux, a forecaster with NOAA's Climate Prediction Center, said.\nEl Nino Messes With Earth In Weird Ways\nForecasters like L'Heureux cringe at comparisons because there's no guarantee the impacts of one El Nino will be just like that of a previous one, even if they look broadly similar. And it's those impacts - like potential rains in drought-stricken California - that most really care about.\nStormy Weather El Nino is not, as Farley's sketch had it, an individual storm, like a hurricane. Rather it is a shift in the background state of the climate brought about by the sloshing of warm ocean water from its normal home in the western tropical Pacific over to the east. That redistribution affects how and where ocean heat is emitted into the atmosphere, which can alter the normal patterns of winds and stormy weather in the region.\nThose more local shifts can telegraph through the atmosphere and, in the case of the United States, can alter the position of the jet stream over the country during the winter months, typically leading to wetter-than-normal conditions over the southern tier of states and warmer temperatures over the north.]\nThose are the effects of El Nino very broadly speaking, though. Such teleconnections, as they are called, tend to be more reliable when the El Nino is a strong one.\nNEWS: El Niño Makes A Late Appearance\nSuch was the case with both the strong events of 1997-1998 and 1982-1983. January and February 1998 were the wettest and warmest first two months to a year for the contiguous United States in the 104-year record at that time, according to NOAA. The position of the jet stream meant that some northern states saw temperatures up to 15 degrees above normal and both the Southeast and Southern California were awash in a series of storms.\nIn California, the rains were so unrelenting that they led to mudslides that caused houses to crumble off disintegrating cliffs and racked up hundreds of millions of dollars in damages.\nWith California now five years into a debilitating drought that has led to the first statewide water restrictions in its history, some El Nino-fueled rains (if not the more damaging aspects) may be quite welcome right now.\nBut here's the thing: Those two strong El Ninos that saw heavy winter rains in California are only that, a sample of two. In science, that's too small a pool to make any firm conclusions, L'Heureux said.\nPHOTOS: Weirdest Weather of 2014\n‘Not the Only Ball Game' There are other factors, from the inherent chaos of the atmosphere, to other large-scale climate signals, that can potentially override any push provided by El Nino.\nThis is exactly what happened with the El Nino of 2009-2010, which while it wasn't as strong as 1997, was still significant. But other climate signals helped blunt its effects in the United States, particularly in terms of temperatures, L'Heureux said. Events like that make forecasters cautious about comparing the current El Nino to 1997. (NOAA acknowledged as much by changing out the original image it used and noting that it did so to avoid confusion).\nVIDEO: It's An El Nino Year, So ... What's An El Nino?\n\"We think that the strength of (El Nino) is important,\" L'Heureux said, but the exact strength it achieves is no guarantee of impacts similar to 1997, \"and that's simply because there's other stuff going on,\" she said. \"El Nino is not the only ball game in town.\"\nSo where does that leave us in terms of looking ahead to what El Nino might bring this winter? We have an event that is looking more and more robust (when comparing June 2015 to June 1997, the broad ocean temperature patterns are very similar) and forecasting models are in pretty good agreement that that event will strengthen as we head towards winter and El Nino's typical peak. But exactly when it will peak and what its final strength will be is still uncertain. Even more uncertain is what those other influences on U.S. weather will be.\nSo what forecasters can say for now is that the likelihood of those typical El Nino impacts, including rains in Southern California, are higher, but exactly where those rains might fall isn't yet known.\nOne factor that may influence that is the remarkable pool of very warm waters that has been parked off the West Coast for a couple years now, a feature that was not present back in 1997. That feature could impact the typical changes El Nino brings to the jet stream, Daniel Swain, a PhD student in climate science at Stanford University, said in an email. It is possible that if the El Nino builds up enough strength, it could overcome that influence, though, he added.\n\"If El Nino really does make into record territory during the coming winter, it's hard to envision California not experiencing a wetter-than-average winter, at least to some degree,\" he said.\nThe only real guarantee that forecasters can make, though, is that this El Nino event \"will evolve in its own way,\" L'Heureux said. \"It may be similar to certain past events,\" but it won't be exactly the same.\nMore From Climate Central:\nEl Niño Helps Boost Pacific Storm Season Why Do We Care So Much About El Niño?\nEl Niño in 90 Seconds This article originally appeared on Climate Central, all rights reserved."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7c5be430-ec5a-4140-9498-4b64c0c14a08>","<urn:uuid:3a780ace-3206-46ab-975e-e5e92c8b2b50>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the soil requirements for Martha Washington geraniums compared to roses?","answer":"Both plants require well-drained soil, but have specific needs. Martha Washington geraniums prefer fertile soil and need soil-less commercial mix in containers, while being susceptible to root rot in heavy clay soils. Roses need fertile loamy soils with 30% organic matter in the top 30cm of growing beds, and require a specific pH of 6 to 6.5. Both plants benefit from organic matter, but roses have more precise requirements for soil composition and pH levels.","context":["Martha Washington Geranium\nEmbrace cool season color with the velvet-petaled Martha Washington Geranium, an old-fashioned favorite that’s tough to beat.\nExpand your geranium horizons with the cool-season member of the family: Martha Washington geranium (Pelargonium x domesticum). Also known as regal geraniums, this group of geraniums features richly colored blooms with petals that resemble velvet. Petals have a lovely ruffled effect that enhances the plants’ luxurious feel.\nThe color range on Martha Washington geranium flowers falls into red-purple shades, including lavender, pink, burgundy and purple. White also appears in the blossom mix, along with a host of wonderfully-painted bicolor blooms. Two common patterns are solid petals with white edging or white centers.\nMartha Washington geraniums have somewhat ruffled leaves in a bright green shade. The edges are often toothed, and leaves release a citrus fragrance when crushed. Overall, Martha Washington geraniums grow roughly 12 to 18 inches tall and 12 to 24 inches wide. The flowers appear in clusters similar to zonal geraniums, but stems tend to be shorter, making a Martha Washington geranium frequently appear to be overloaded with flowers.\nThese pretty bloomers grow best when air temperatures are below 60°F. Martha Washington geraniums set their flower buds when night temperatures hover in the 50- to 60-degree range. As a result, they’re popular as spring plants, most often bought as gifts for spring holidays, such as Easter or Mother’s Day. Once summer temperatures arrive, plants usually stop flowering. If you like the look of Martha Washington geraniums and live where summer brings on some sizzle, plan to pull plants out of pots or planting beds as heat arrives and replace them with traditional garden or zonal geraniums.\nMartha Washington geraniums prefer fertile, well-drained soil. In landscape beds, amend soil with plenty of organic matter prior to planting. In containers, use a commercial soil-less mix developed for use in planters. These mixes provide the right drainage for plants in a container to thrive. Martha Washington geraniums are susceptible to root rot, so avoid overwatering plants or tucking them into heavy clay soils in planting beds.\nPlace your Martha Washington geraniums where they’ll receive direct sun, but protect them from hottest afternoon sun in all regions. If plants don’t get enough sunlight, flower numbers drop. Encourage flower formation by removing spent blooms. This also helps reduce fungus development on rotting blooms. If you see any signs of fuzzy mold-type growth (botrytis) on Martha Washington geraniums or orange or brown spots on leaves, remove affected plant parts and destroy them.\nAvoid using high-nitrogen fertilizers on Martha Washington geraniums. Instead, select a bloom booster-type fertilizer that helps promote flower formation. A high potassium fertilizer developed for vegetables works well, too. On the fertilizer bag, the first number, which represents nitrogen content, should be no more than half of the other two numbers. For instance, a fertilizer labeled 10-10-10 isn’t the right type to use. Instead, use one labeled like 4-8-10, which is typically a flower and/or vegetable fertilizer, or 2-4-1, a typical fish-based plant food.","Any individual can start commercial rose cultivation by two ways. Open field and greenhouse. However, you can go for greenhouse option for quality rose production as the cut flower. Rose comes with the different variety, colour, and size. Commercial rose cultivation is a profitable business. In addition, the business demands small startup capital to initiate a rose farm.\nThe scientific name of the rose is Rosa. And it is a perennial shrub or vine of the Rosa genus and the family Rosaceae. In India, the major rose producing states are Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and West Bengal.\nEconomic Importance Of Rose Cultivation\nThere are several value-added products you can produce from the rose. These are rose oil, rose water and gulkhand. Furthermore, fresh roses have good domestic and international market. In addition, roses are essential items in preparing bouquets, floral arrangements, worship, social occasions and presentation of gifts. However, cut rose ranks first in terms of volume of trade in the international market. Only the production of high quality flowers at low cost can stand upto international competition.\nThings To Consider In Commercial Rose Cultivation\n- First of all, determine for what purpose you are growing rose. Because it determines the rest of the factors.\n- Secondly, choose the right variety.\n- Have a marketing plan.\n- Craft a business plan including the financial inputs. In addition, calculate an expected ROI from your rose farm.\n- Arrange proper irrigation system.\n- Check every input is ready with you for the application.\nBest Improved Varieties For Rose Cultivation\n- Floribunda: This variety comes with short flower and shorter stems. However, it yields much higher than other types. Ex. Kiss, Florence, Frisco, Mercedes.\n- Hybrid Tea: This variety comes with a large flower and long stems. In addition, this variety fetches more profits than others. Ex. Melody, Darling, Sonia, Vivaldi.\n- Spray: This variety carries 5 to 6 flowers on a single stem. However, the steam yields low. Ex. Nikita, Evelien, and Joy.\nSome of the popular hybrid varieties are Gladiator, Baby Pink, Sofia Lawrence, YCD 1, YCD 2, YCD 3.\nAgro Climatic Condition For Rose Cultivation\nFirst of all, you must provide plenty of light, a humid and moderate temperature ranging from 15°C to 28°C. If you are growing under the greenhouse, you must provide ventilation. Light is an important factor. It decides the growth of the roses. Furthermore, you can find a slower growth by day length with 12 hours and heavy overcast, cloudy/misty conditions. High relative humidity exposes the plant to serious fungal diseases. In tropics, the ideal temperature is 25°C – 30°C on a sunny day and on a cloudy day 18°C – 20°C.\nSuitable Soil For Rose Cultivation\nRose grows well in the plains under ideal condition of fertile loamy soils with salt-free irrigation water. Well-drained soil rich in organic matter and oxygen is good for roses. Organic matter as high as 30% in the top 30 cm of the growing beds is perfect for rose farming. In addition, you must maintain a pH of the soil around 6 to 6.5.\nRose Cultivation Basic Steps\nFirst of all, you must prepare the beds or pits before one month of planting. The suitable depth of the bed is 60 to 90 cm. Fill the pit with a mixture of soil and farmyard manure. Flood the bed with water to settle down the loose soil. Add more mixture of soil and manure for leveling the bed.\nThe most popular propagation options are root cutting and budding on Briar rootstocks. Before planting remove all dried, dead, damaged and diseased twigs, leaves and damaged root coming out of earth ball etc with sharp secateurs.\nThe newly planted rose need frequent watering till they establish and afterwards once or twice a week. You must do weeding and hoeing after every alternate watering. In addition, all roses require pruning in the second year of their planting and subsequent years. After 6 months or so, there is every chance that the soil becomes stony. Therefore, you must loose the soil for efficient irrigation.\nThe removal of leaves is known as defoliation. However, you must do it to induce certain plant species to flower or to reduce transpiration loss during periods of stress. In addition, you can remove the leaves manually or by withholding water.\nPlant Protection System In Rose Cultivation\nThe principal pests of roses are Red spider mite, Leaf rollers, White fly, Thrips, Aphide and Nematode. The principal diseases are Powdery mildew, Downy mildew, Botrytis, Pruning die back and Black leaf spot. However, the attcks depen on the variety and agroclimatic condition. You will need to prepare with the intensive protection system.\nHarvesting & Storage In Rose Cultivation\nYou can harvest the flowers with sharp secateure at the tight bud stage when the colour is fully developed. In addition, you must keep at least 1 to 2 leaves with The plant after the cutting. Because it helps to encourage production of new strong shoots. Furthermore, you must harvest preferably during early morning hours.\nIdeally, roses immediately after harvest should be graded, packed, precooled and despatched by refrigerated vehicle. In case of delay in grading and packaging flowers are shifted to the cold store. Before shifting to the cold store, it is advisable to re-cut the stems, about 2 cm. above the previous level without removing lower leaves/thorns and again place them in clean containers in clean warm (40-480C) water, adjusted with citric acid to pH 3.0-3.5.

{"question":"How do MSC stem cells aid in tissue regeneration, and what are the regulatory challenges in approving such treatments?","answer":"MSC stem cells aid tissue regeneration through multiple mechanisms: they modulate immune function by secreting cytokines and trophic factors, interact with immune cells to suppress inflammatory reactions, and activate endogenous regenerative mechanisms. They can migrate to damaged sites and initiate regeneration through cell proliferation and stimulation of processes like chondrogenesis. However, regulatory challenges exist in approving such treatments, as demonstrated by cases like the FDA's controversial approval of treatments based on surrogate endpoints without clear clinical benefits. There are also grey areas in regulating clinical trials, with some unapproved studies leading to severe adverse effects and even deaths, highlighting the need for proper regulation to ensure safety and efficacy.","context":["What dormant power lies in stem cells? How to unleash this power?\nThus far, MSCs have remained unavailable for veterinary therapies. By using them as the active pharmaceutical ingredient in the medicinal products we develop, we are pushing the boundaries of treatment for companion animals.\nisolated from adipose tissue can modulate the inflammatory microenvironment through the inhibition of proliferation and cytotoxic activity of T-cells, as well as the suppression of growth and maturation of B-cells and natural killer (NK) cells by engaging a range of cytokines, including interleukin IL-6, IL-10 and transforming growth factor beta. In addition, by inhibiting the maturation of dendritic cells, they induce their immune tolerance. The activated dendritic cells enhance the inductive effect of MSCs on regulatory T-cells through interleukin IL-10 creating an immunosuppressive environment that fosters regeneration processes.\nImmunomodulacja. Immunomodulation. MSC Interactions between MSCs and immune cells.\nThe immunomodulatory properties of MSCs described in the article are one of the key modes of action in mesenchymal stem cell-based treatments. Specifically, MSCs act by:\n“Improved techniques of MSC isolation and in vitro culture have made it possible to use stem cells obtained from bone marrow, adipose tissue, umbilical cord or umbilical cord blood as an excellent source of cells for supportive cell therapy – useful as a means of tissue and organ regeneration. Extensive pre-clinical and clinical studies have confirmed the effectiveness of stem cells when applied in the treatment of bone injuries and skeletal muscle regeneration, among other uses. MSCs can be used therapeutically in multiple ways – for example, by utilising their immunomodulatory properties. The cells modulate immune function through the secretion of cytokines, chemokines and trophic factors that directly affect damaged tissues.”\n“Allogeneic MSCs extensively interact with specific and non-specific immune cells, significantly modifying their proinflammatory cytokine expression profiles. It has been demonstrated that MSCs interact with mature type 1 and 2 (DC1, DC2) dendritic cells, inhibiting tumour necrosis factor alpha production and stimulating interleukin 10 expression. MSCs also affect the polarisation of T-cell immune responses towards Th2 and increase the ratio of regulatory T-cells. The physiological effect of MSCs on the cytokine profiles of immune cells lies in inducing immune tolerance and suppressing inflammatory reactions.”\nMSC-based treatment of early and advanced degenerative joint lesions works by activating endogenous regenerative mechanisms – MSCs migrate from synovial fluid to the damaged site, where cells initiate the regeneration process following adhesion and chemotactic recruitment of local MSCs. This is a result of cell proliferation and stimulation of chondrogenesis with autocrine and paracrine signals, including TGF-β, coming from both the administered MSCs and the microenvironment of the damaged tissue. The tissue is reconstructed via the therapeutic chondrogenic process, restoring the functionality of the damaged joint.\nThe pro-regenerative effect of MSCs in the affected joint.\nPuls Biznesu about our plans: Bioceltix announces that it will soon debut on NewConnect – the company has recently completed the pre-IPO round.

In his speech on the Precision Medicine Initiative, then-President Obama made uplifting points, “And that’s the promise of precision medicine – delivering the right treatments, at the right time, every time to the right person… we want to have a nation in which the accidents and circumstances of our birth aren’t determining our fate, and therefore born with a particular disease or a particular genetic makeup that makes us more vulnerable to something; that that’s not our destiny, that’s not our fate – that we can remake it.”\nIndeed, the potential benefits are tremendous, but so are the risks: in the form of escalating medical bills, with unproven – or worse still – harmful treatments. In this article, I give Governments and Healthcare providers three areas to pay attention to when it comes to personalized medicine: Regulation, Healthcare Finance, and democratizing the benefits of personalized medicine.\nNew Pressures on Regulation\nAs new personalized treatment modalities emerge, regulators are facing increasing pressure to green-light interventions, even if clinical benefits are not clear – to provide patients with a chance to live.\nA watershed case was the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)’s ruling against a scientific advisory panel, in favor of patient advocacy groups to approve Exondys 51 marketed by Sarepta for treating Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Despite a majority (7 to 6) of the experts citing inadequate convincing clinical evidence, the FDA director greenlit the approval of Exondys 51 due to a lack of clinical alternatives. Many commentators felt that this case set a precedent for the approval of personalized medicine products based on surrogate endpoints without clinical benefits.\nThere are also many grey areas when it comes to regulating clinical trials. As with any emerging technology, the benefits come at a risk, which people desperate for a cure may be willing to take. Due to the exploratory nature of trials involving new treatment modalities, patient safety is often left in the hands of researchers: a simple search on ClinicalTrials.gov shows nearly 6000 clinical studies involving stem cells, some of which have not been approved.\nSome of these trials have resulted in debilitating consequences. For example, severe adverse effects, some resulting in death, turned the spotlight on Juno Therapeutics’ lead CAR-T cell therapy for treating adults with late stage acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The risks of stem cell therapy are also not well understood. Although treatment with autologous fat-derived stem cells has been used for various indications, a poorly administered trial recently led to permanent eye damage in three elderly patients with macular degeneration (damage to parts of the retina in one’s eye).\nWithout proper regulation and well-controlled clinical trials, the safety and efficacy of stem cell treatments cannot be determined.\nSome researchers show more caution than others. In the first human trial that uses an induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derivative, investigators from Japan successfully treated macular degeneration by administering retinal pigment epithelial cells grown from the patients’ own stem cells. Yet, after identifying a few mutations in the second patient’s cells, the RIKEN group decided to suspend the trial in September 2015 before obtaining clearance from health authorities in Japan to resume in February 2017. Perhaps all scientists and clinicians would do well to hold themselves to a similar standard.\nRegulatory bodies such as the FDA must continually engage and balance the needs of the scientific, patients, and clinical communities in meeting these new regulatory challenges – unfortunately, there are no easy answers.\n2. New Pressures on Healthcare Finance\nWith the flood of new interventions, another issue to consider is cost. If all interventions are fully reimbursed (i.e. paid for) by state and private payers, the healthcare system will soon become bankrupt. Yet, if no help is given, the cost to patients of living longer is bankruptcy. The American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) wrote in a brief that a patient living with cancer is now three times more likely to file for bankruptcy than a healthy person.\nPolicymakers must strike a fine balance of curbing the rapid rise in healthcare spending without disincentivizing innovation and depriving patients of access to life saving treatments.\nWhen weighing the clinical benefits of a new drug product with the cost, healthcare economists typically apply a measure called the incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) which takes the difference in cost between the new drug and existing alternatives and divides it by the change in quality adjusted life years (QALY). The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) of the U.K., for example, sets an ICER limit of £30,000 per QALY gained for new drugs including targeted therapies. Most policymakers in the U.S. generally apply an ICER limit of USD$50,000 per QALY gained.\nEarly evidence suggests that personalized medicine tests are generally cost effective, with 20% of them resulting in cost saving and more than half achieving ICER of less than $50,000 per QALY gained. However, measures of cost effectiveness apply a single threshold to a heterogeneous population. If reimbursement was based on this alone, some people would receive more healthcare than they would choose, and others less. As such, commentators have noted that “reimbursement mechanisms for targeted therapies are still very blunt in an era of personalized medicine”.\nPolicymakers must leverage data and work with other stakeholders to improve reimbursement policies, especially taking into consideration the underserved population. Yet, the onus does not belong to the policymakers alone. Drugmakers, payers and clinicians are very much involved in the determining how drugs are priced and reimbursed. Recently, there have been exhortations by clinicians for more value-based pricing whereby reimbursement is contingent upon patient outcomes. The focus on outcomes could ensure that personalized medicine realizes its full clinical value. To achieve that, drugmakers could enter risk-sharing agreements with payers for partial reimbursement prior to demonstrating clinical effectiveness.\nAlternatively, clinicians can also exert pricing pressure on drugmakers indirectly. In 2012, researchers from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK) evaluated the drugs Zaltrap and Avastin for treating colorectal cancer. Although Zaltrap cost twice as much as Avastin, the MSK researchers found no differences in efficacy between the drugs. Consequently, MSK decided to not recommend Zaltrap to patients and this led the drug’s co-marketer Sanofi to drop the price.\nTogether, stakeholders can work to ensure that personalized medicine is conscionable and cost effective.\n3. Democratizing the impacts of Personalised Medicine\nFinally, perhaps personalized medicine should be about more than just the diagnosis and the cure. Personalized medicine could go a long way towards disease prevention and mitigation by engaging the laymen and teaching them to monitor and manage their own health. In a recent trip with my parents to their dental appointment at a polyclinic in Singapore, I could not help but notice that the Health Promotion Board set up a booth that encouraged senior citizens to get screened for colorectal cancer. Participants were instructed to fill out their information, collect samples of their stool at home in the kits provided, and send the kits back for analyses. Though seemingly mundane, campaigns like this are probably the most effective way of bringing personalized medicine to the masses.\nLow cost point-of-care diagnostics can also help to bridge the divide between first world medicine and third world need for solutions. After all, if the goal of personalized medicine is to understand and improve lives, esoteric treatments will hardly do a majority of the public any good.\nFinally, it is a positive development that countries are thinking about how to democratize the benefits of personalized medicine. For example, the U.S. National Institute of Health is collecting data from underserved populations that are historically underrepresented in biomedical research, so that they too can benefit from personalized medicine.\nWe have already seen the good that personalized medicine can do. Yet, if we want the broader public to benefit from personalized medicine while minimizing both the financial and clinical risks to society and patients, there is still so much more that we must do. Stakeholders must continue working together to advance the personalization of medicine, not for fame or fortune, but for the greater good.\nThanks for reading this two-part series on personalized medicine and public good. When I started this blog, one objective was to use it as platform for issue-experts in technology fields to give us mini crash-courses, and to sketch out the implications for society.

While nothing else conclusive was found, they did capture several minutes of clear underwater footage for further study and collected mud samples to analyze for fresh-water shell fragments.","context":["Dispatch 5: Change of Course\nJuly 15, 1999(Note: Nationalgeographic.com does not research or edit dispatches.)\nBallard was frustrated. Two days out at sea, and the cameras on the remotely operated vehicle (ROV) had recorded close to zero footage of the sea floor.\nOnce his boat—the “Z” boat—left the protective embrace of the port, choppy waves and strong currents pulled the tethered ROV off course. The team spent most of its time hauling it in and dropping it back.\nHe had contemplated taking the Z boat and ROV out at night—when the waters are calmer. But on the third day, the sun shined on a flat sea and Ballard planned to make the most of a promising day—with a slight change of course.\nFirst, a fourth boat, the Saros, from the Turkish Institute of Nautical Archaeology, would join the expedition to survey a canyon that was found a few days earlier by the sonar ship, Guven.\nNext, both ROVs were to be deployed. The larger of the two, the Sea Rover, would do double duty as a sonar surveyor and “big picture” video camera. The smaller ROV, the Benthos Mini-Rover Mark II or “Geek,” would be deployed to do high-resolution, close-up camera work.\nFinally, David Mindell was enlisted to act as navigator, sonar operator, and science team coordinator under Ballard. Mindell had been leading the sonar survey on the Guven.\nThe plan went like this: The Z boat would head out to about 27 Kilometers [17 miles], where the ancient shoreline was found. The Sea Rover, equipped with sonar, would then be lowered into the water and guided to a depth of about 155 meters [510 feet]. It would then “transect,” or cross through, the beach of that shoreline at several different points to give the team a better idea of the lay of the land. Interesting features would immediately be plotted and videotaped.\n(Thus far, several pieces of evidence indicate that a river could have met the ancient lake at the shoreline. On land near Sinop, a valley leads to the current shoreline of the Black Sea. Before about 5600 B.C., a river could have run through that valley, meandered along a bluff that is now flat sea floor, rushed down a steep trench into what is now an underwater canyon, and finally met the lake, depositing sediments that may now lie on the sea floor.)\nAccording to Mindell, “the theory is that people settled on the bluffs where the river met the sea.” This theory is consistent with observations made by the land archaeologists that all human settlements in the Sinop peninsula were made on ridges, bluffs, and other high points.\nWhat signs of settlement is the underwater team hoping to find? Clam shells, for one. Ancient hunters and gatherers living near fresh-water lakes might have left mounds of shells behind. And mussels and clams both inhabit coasts—their remains would be good delineators of shorelines.\nThe “change of course” and the calm sea both made for a good day.\nBoth ROVs were successfully lowered to the bottom of the sea several times at different places and depths. The “Geek” taped several minutes of very clear underwater footage that the team will study carefully. Although nothing conclusive was found, some interesting evidence turned up.\nA teammate found a small black pebble on the skid of one of the ROVs. Ballard was delighted. The pebble was basalt—a sign of volcanic activity that could become an important clue.\nThe find inspired Fred Hiebert to scoop mud off the bottom of the ROVs when they were pulled up again. The mud will be analyzed for the presence of fresh-water shell fragments—another possible clue.\nSatisfied that a good day’s work was done, Ballard told the captain to head for home.\n© 1999 National Geographic Society.

{"question":"In terms of recyclability and environmental impact, how do RealCup EcoCup capsules compare to the Goodness Me food packaging system?","answer":"RealCup EcoCup capsules and Goodness Me packaging both offer partial recyclability but with different approaches. EcoCup capsules require separating components - the outer plastic cup (#6 polystyrene) is recyclable, while the lid and filter go to trash, and grounds are compostable. Goodness Me packaging is more comprehensively eco-friendly, with an inner packet made from compostable GMO-free plant cellulose and an outer box made from minimum 70% recycled plant fiber that's both renewable and recyclable.","context":["In the past year, manufacturers have begun producing eco-friendly alternatives to the traditional plastic K-Cup® pods. This is exciting news for consumers, who can now enjoy single serve coffee, lattes, hot chocolates and teas without contributing to landfills. The solutions range from recyclable capsules to almost fully biodegradable pods – manufacturers are using sustainable materials in their packaging in hopes of eventually cutting plastic out of the packaging all together.\nHere is a breakdown of the different capsules and brands that feature environmentally friendly options for single serve lovers.\nRealCup® EcoCup™ Capsules\nThe RealCup® EcoCup™ capsules are designed to be recyclable. They are manufactured with easily separated components, so you can recycle and compost the appropriate parts. The EcoCup™ is compatible for use with Keurig® K-Cup® brewers.\nRecycling the EcoCup™ is easy. After brewing, let the capsule cool and then:\n- Locate the raised symbol on the side of the cup.\n- Peel away the lid from the outer plastic cup and separate the lid from the filter.\n- Recycle the outer plastic cup where #6 polystyrene plastic is accepted*. Compost the coffee grinds/tea, and place the remaining lid and filter in the trash.\n*Check with your local recycling service provider.\nThe following brands use the EcoCup™ capsule:\n97% Biodegradable OneCup™\nOneCup™ is a type of coffee pod developed by the Rogers Family Gourmet Coffee & Tea Company that is 97% biodegradable. They plan on releasing a new capsule very soon that will be 100% biodegradable! OneCup™ coffee pods come packaged in recyclable and biodegradable components for additional eco-friendliness. The OneCup™ is compatible for use with Keurig® K-Cup® brewers.\nThe ring and lid of the OneCup™ coffee pods are both created from plant based materials that are biodegradable, the box and the bag that the capsules come in are cardboard and paper products that can be recycled, and the coffee is shade grown, pure 100% Arabica Coffee. The filter is created from food grade materials, however it is not yet compostable.\nComposting the OneCup™ is easy. After brewing, let the pod cool and then:\n- Cut off the filter of the capsule after it has cooled.\n- Separate the coffee grounds and the lid from the filter.\n- Deposit the coffee grounds, lid and capsule into your compost bin.\nNote: The OneCup™ will be fully composted in 3-6 months, and composts faster in a warmer environment.\nThe following brands use the OneCup™ coffee pod:\n98% Recyclable Capsules with Biodegradable Filters\nThere are also brands that are using capsules made with fully biodegradable and recyclable components. These capsules are great because you don’t put a single part in the trash!\nThe lids are made from recyclable high barrier aluminum, the capsule is created using a proprietary formulation plastic which is also recyclable, and the filter is a biodegradable custom weave made from natural fibres. The 98% Recyclable Capsules with Biodegradable Filters are compatible for use with Keurig® K-Cup® brewers.\nRecycling the capsule is easy. After brewing, let the capsule cool and then:\n- Locate the tab on the lid.\n- Peel away the lid and separate the filter from the outer plastic cup. Recycle the outer plastic cup and lid.\n- Compost the remaining filter and coffee grounds/tea!\nBonus: If you are brewing a latte or hot chocolate, there is no filter so you can recycle those capsules right after use.\nThe following brands use the 98% Recyclable Capsules with Biodegradable Filters:","Quitting these 10 plastic items will make a significant difference whether you are trying to achieve a zero waste lifestyle or simply reduce the waste you send to the landfill. The key is to avoid single-use plastic items altogether. You will be surprised at how much of your waste is reduced if you can manage to avoid these ten plastic products. After all, every little bit helps.\n1.) Plastic toothbrushes\nReplace with: A bamboo toothbrush.\nEverything about this product is biodegradable – the handle, bristles and packaging! It works just like any other toothbrush and lasts just as long. The Environmental Toothbrush is available in adult and child sizes, as well as a bulk pack.\nCost: R40 for a single toothbrush (any size), or R115 for a bulk pack of 3 toothbrushes. (Buy here).\n2.) Plastic fresh produce bags\nReplace with: Fresh Bags\nYou can now finally replace those thin plastic bags you use to weigh your fresh produce at the grocery store. Fresh bags are made out of light-weight nylon mesh and are sealed by pulling the coloured ribbon (kinda like a drawstring bag). Yes, it means that you need to remember to take these into the store with you, but you could always leave them in the car so you don’t forget them at home. You can also avoid using these plastic bags by asking the store clerk to weigh the item and just slap a sticker directly onto it. I do this with single items like garlic, ginger etc.\nCost: R69 for two Fresh bags – 26cm x 24cm. (Buy here).\n3.) Plastic grocery bags\nReplace with: Material bags or Trolley Bags.\nWe’ve all seen these material bags for sale at the checkout counters of grocery stores. Some of us have a pile of them that never leave the house or car. Again, the point is to remember to actually take these into the store with us. You can do it! It’s just a matter of making a habit of not buying plastic bags.\nTrolley Bags use a similar concept to these fabric bags, except that they spread out to fit perfectly into your trolley, making it more convenient to check-out. Four fabric bags are attached together with Velcro so that you can rack them in your trolley (pictured above). They are also detachable so that you can easily pack your groceries into your car.\nCost: Trolley Bags cost R399 (for a set of four bags). They are available online . Standard fabrics bags are about R15 each at most grocery stores, but you can use any material bag. The point is to stop buying single-use plastic bags.\n4.) Cling wrap\nReplace with: Abeego reusable food wrap, or Buzzy Wraps.\nSay goodbye to cling wrap once and for all with these two alternatives:\nBoth Abeego and Buzzy Wraps are made out of beeswax, tree resin and jojoba oil infused into hemp and organic cotton cloth. It is fully compostable and can be used to create a relatively airtight seal on food items. It is used in much the same way as cling wrap. They are available in a variety pack with three different sized wraps (18x18cm, 25x25cm, 33x33cm), or a large pack with two large wraps (33x33cm).\n5.) Ziploc bags\nReplace with: Good for the Ground Compostable Film Bags\nIt looks like plastic, feels like plastic and works like plastic, but it’s not plastic! This packaging is completely compostable and biodegradable. These film bags are made from a starch derivative of corn, sugar cane, straw, wood or other annually renewable resources and will break down in 45 days. Although these bags don’t seal like Ziploc bags, I find that using a peg to close them works perfectly too.\nCost: R19.50 for 10 small bags (200x100mm). R33.50 for 10 large bags (300x130mm). R115 for 100 small bags (Buy here).\n6.) Plastic straws\nReplace with: Glass, bamboo or stainless steel straws.\nMake the effort to rather carry one reusable glass, or stainless steel straw around with you in your handbag or car. You can also buy a straw cleaner which makes it easy to really scrub inside the straw. Stainless steel straws are the most affordable and practical option to carry around, whereas glass straws make a beautiful alternative when hosting parties at home etc.\nStraws may seem like a small and insignificant piece of plastic, but when you consider that Americans alone use over 500 millions straws every day; then it becomes an obvious plastic item to avoid. It’s these small pieces of plastic that end up in the stomach’s of our precious wildlife and kills them.\nR95 for a stainless steel straw and R57 for a straw cleaner (buy these here). R39 for a bamboo straw (buy here). From R205 for a set of two glass Stream Straws. They are available in a variety of styles. (buy here).\n7.) disposable plastic cutlery\nReplace with: Wooden cutlery or compostable cutlery.\nBoth individuals and businesses can replace their disposable cutlery with affordable and biodegradable alternatives. Green Home is a local business that offers businesses both wooden and compostable cutlery in bulk. Their wooden cutlery is made from FSC certified sustainable plantations, and their compostable ‘plastic-like’ cutlery is actually made from renewable plant based raw materials like corn starch. (View their cutlery range here). Prices range from R16 – R30 for their packs of 10.\nFor a picnic, party or braai, you can find an 18-piece wooden cutlery set here on Takealot, which includes six forks, knives and spoons for R80.\n8.) Plastic bottled water\nReplace with: A reusable glass or stainless steel bottle.\nStart carrying your own re-usable bottle around, instead of buying bottled water. It’s cheaper and eco-friendly. Glass or stainless steel bottles are best. If you buy bottled water because you cannot drink your tap water, you should consider investing in a good water purifier or filter. Remember to look for BPA-free bottles to ensure that no harmful chemicals will leak into your water.\n9.) Disposable coffee cups\nReplace with: Ecoffee Cup (for individuals) or Green Home’s compostable takeaway cups (for businesses).\nDID YOU KNOW?\n100 billion paper cups are thrown away (not recycled) every year, and 20 million trees are cut down in the process of manufacturing paper cups. The amount of water used in the process is approximately 12 billion gallons.\nYou can make a difference to this horrifying statistic by choosing to use a reusable coffee cup. If you often buy coffee on-the-go, then take your reusable cup with you into the café and ask the waitron to fill that up instead. There are various options of reusable cups to choose from – ceramic, stainless steel and plastic. Ecoffee Cups, on the other hand, are reusable mugs that are made out of organic bamboo fibre and non-GMO corn starch. They are also BPA free. These cups are available in a variety of stylish and fun designs.\nCost: R199 for 340ml, or R209 for 400ml Ecoffee Cup. (buy here).\nYou can also recommend a biodegradable packaging option to your local café . Businesses should consider replacing their takeaway packaging with Green Home’s eco-friendlier packaging options. Their cups are completely compostable and they also offer other products like coffee cup holders made from recycled paper and wooden stirrers made from certified sustainable plantations. Their products are available in packs of 50, cartons of 500 and 1000. (View their product range here)\n10.) Foods packaged in plastic\nReplace with: Foods in the Goodness Me range.\nFoods like popcorn, lentils and beans that are typically packaged in plastic are now avoidable since brands like Goodness Me have introduced their recyclable and affordable alternatives. Goodness Me offer a small selection of very affordable, non-GMO foods that are also packaged with the environment in mind. The inner packet is made from GMO-free annually renewable plant cellulose, which is compostable and fully biodegradable. The outer box is made from a minimum of 70% recycled plant fibre, which is renewable and recyclable. Their product range includes: Popcorn, lentils (red and brown), chickpeas, haricots, black-eyed beans, polenta and split peas.\nCost: From R25 – R40 for a 500g box, depending on the food. (buy here).\nAnother grocery shopping tip that will reduce your plastic waste is to take containers with you to the butcher and ask them to put your meat in there instead. This way, you will avoid the nasty Styrofoam trays and cling wrap that meat is typically packaged in.\nDo you have any helpful tips to reduce plastic waste?

{"question":"How can traders continue trading even after being banned from a major stock exchange?","answer":"Unlike stock exchanges, where getting banned is career suicide, traders can continue trading in commodity and forex markets by simply registering in a different jurisdiction. Thanks to the Internet, they can register in a different country, like Malta, without having to live there. This is because commodity and forex markets don't have the same monopoly power as stock exchanges, where specialized traders cannot simply move to another country and learn new rules.","context":["There are three major types of financial exchanges\n- Stocks and bonds\n- Commodity exchange\n- Foreign exchange (Forex)\nStock exchanges, where stocks and bonds are traded, are highly regulated and don’t transcend national boundaries. The listed companies have to follow disclosure protocols decided by the government and the exchange. The stocks that are traded on these exchanges are mostly unique to the exchanges. For example, Google is only listed on the American exchange of NASDAQ. So, to buy Google stock, you need to conform to American laws. Also, you can only sell these shares back on NASDAQ and that too only within certain hours of the day. Therefore, these exchanges have some monopoly power.\nHowever, commodities can be easily resold and delivered on other domestic exchanges and with some effort across national boundaries as well. Therefore, unlike stock exchanges, commodity exchanges do not have a monopoly over what’s being traded on them. The only advantage they can offer to the traders is a marketplace where they can find counterparties to take a position against their trade. Traders don’t have to arbitrate, that is, buy from one market at a lower price and then sell to another at a higher. Just the fact they can do it ensures that prices differences are minimized. Crude oil is the most actively traded commodity in the world and unlike Google stock, a trader can trade in crude oil, practically, in any commodity exchange in the world. Some other commodities could be traded in exchanges specific to a country.\nForeign Exchange (forex) markets are different. In theory, one can be run a US Dollar – Euro foreign exchange in Nigeria. Therefore, these transcend national boundaries. Most forex markets, however, are regulated. Forex markets are practically 24-hours a day, 7-days a week. Since major currency pairs like USD-EURO can be traded in any major forex exchange on the world, these markets practically never close. This distinction is subtle but important. For example, consider Apple Inc. which is listed on NASDAQ in the USA. If some bad news related to say Apple is published in media on Friday evening after NASDAQ is closed for trading then the traders cannot trade their Apple stocks till the Monday morning. But if Britain’s exit from EU (Brexit) is canceled on a Friday evening then the forex market will react immediately to the news.\nAnother subtle distinction is that big stock exchanges can enforce their rules and if a trader behaves badly then they can ban him/her for life. Getting banned from a major exchange is career suicide. A trader who, say specializes in tech stocks or healthcare stocks of a country cannot simply move to another country and learn the rules there. Commodity and forex markets are different. One can simply register in a different jurisdiction and start trading. Thanks to the Internet, being registered in Malta does not require one to live in Malta.\n|Type||Monopoly||Restricted to a country||24-hours a day|\nWhat’s traded on crypto exchanges is not unique to those exchanges. Just like USD can be purchased on pretty much every exchange, one can buy Bitcoin from any exchange, 24-hours a day. But while Forex markets are trading on the optimism or pessimism around a nation’s economy, commodity markets are pure speculation around demand and supply of a commodity. Therefore, cryptocurrency exchanges are akin to commodity exchanges. And since the goods are virtual, they easily transcend national boundaries. Therefore, inter-exchange trading implies price arbitrage will be rare in the longer run. So, what decides one exchange will win over another? Given that an exchange does not have the monopoly over what’s being traded, the only major barriers I can think of are either regulatory or higher liquidity."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a3d1f15d-8d06-40f1-a045-6c99fe6069fa>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What is a design vehicle in road engineering, and how does it relate to air quality considerations in port areas?","answer":"A design vehicle is the largest type of vehicle most likely to use a particular road that engineers consider when designing or analyzing roads. For example, in residential subdivisions, a UPS or FedEx truck might be the design vehicle, while for interstates, it's typically a WB-65 tractor-trailer that is 74 feet from nose to tail. The design vehicle affects many aspects including intersection design, turning radius, and sight distances. Regarding air quality, these large vehicles, particularly in port areas, contribute significantly to air and noise pollution. Newer trucks pollute less due to improved emission control technologies like diesel particulate filters (DPFs) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems installed since 2007 and 2010 respectively. Ports need to consider truck emissions when designing routes and often implement programs to replace older trucks with newer, cleaner models to improve air quality in nearby communities.","context":["Websites and Citations:\n- Theme Music: Five Star Fall, Mercurial Girl, Magnatune.com\nHello and welcome to another edition of Talking Traffic. My name is Bill Ruhsam and I host this podcast and its sister website, talking traffic dot org. Today is Monday, June 27, 2011. This is episode 39 of Talking traffic.\nToday’s topic is about trucks. All kinds of trucks. But before I dive into the nebulous term that is “trucks” let me throw some engineer-speak at you.\nWhen we are designing or analyzing roads, we talk about the “Design Vehicle”. The design vehicle is the largest type of vehicle that is most likely to use that road. For example, if I’m working on a residential subdivision, I dont’ need to design the road to allow a tractor-trailer to turn around in a cul-de-sac. No, a typical large vehilce for a subdivision would be a UPS or FedEx truck. Now, the occasional tractor trailer might come into that roadway, maybe a moving truck, but it only happens occasionally, and the inconvenience caused by having to back up a tractor-trailer to turn it around is small compared to the inconvenience of designing the subdivision to allow the truck to drive around as if it were an interstate.\nIt’s important to determine at teh very beginning what your design vehicle is because it will affect many different things in your roadway project.\nNow, let’s talk about trucks. When I, as a traffic engineer say “truck”, I mean some specific types of vehicles. I’m not talking about pickups or SUVs or dooleys or anything that you migt see in a Ford commercial. I’m talking about larger vehicles that are intended to carry freight. These trucks break down into two cateogries. Single Unit trucks, and Multi Unit trucks.\nSingle Unit trucks are trucks that don’t articulate, that have a single frame to which the wheels are attached. UPS and FedEx trucks are good examples of these. dump trucks and garbage trucks and smaller moving trucks are all examples of the single unit truck.\nMulti-unit trucks include the typical tractor-trailer combination that you see everywhere. These come in various sizes measured from the center of the front axle to the center of the rear most axle. So, when I’m throwing engineering speak at people. I would refer to the WB-62 design vehicle, which means a multi-unit tractor-trailer combination that has a 62 foot wheel base. This truck is actually about 69 feet from nose to tail. There are also the WB-40 and the WB-50 and the WB-65. For trivia purposes, the WB-65, which is 74 feet from nose to tail, is the vehicle used when designing interstaets and interstate ramp terminals.\nThe importance of the design vehicle becomes clear when you start putting together the design of intersections and sharp curves. Larger trucks need more room in order to make turns. The rear wheels of a truck–well, of any vehicle, really–will run to the inside of the front wheels. This wider path made during a turn is called overtracking, and its why you see large trucks swing out really wide when they’re making right angle turns at intersections. The distance and width needed to ensure that the rear wheels of the design vehicle stay off the edge of pavement, or out of the adjacent lanes, can add a lot of cost to a design project.\nNext time you’re walking in an area that has curbs and you come to an intersection, look at the corners. Do you see tire tracks up against the curb faces? Do you see tire tracks on top of the curb, or on the sidewalk? Are the corners, maybe including the pedestrian ramps, broken and cracked? If any of these are true, it means most likely that truck drivers are running their rear wheels up and over the curbs when they’re trying to make turns. This could be becuase the driver isn’t very good, but more likely it’s because there’s not enough room for the trucks to clear when taking their overtracking into account.\nLarge vehicles are also important to consider when we’re designing intersections and considering the time it takes to accelerate. For example, the distance you need to be able to see to your left, or to your right, when you’re trying to turn onto a roadway. On a 45 mile per hour road, with no other consideations, that distance should be 500 feet if you’re driving a car. If you’re driving a tractor trailer, then I have to add another 270 feet! A football field worth of view, basically. That means no hills, curves or bushes to block the view of that truck driver trying to make a left turn.\nSimilarly, if I’m working on signal timing, and I know that large trucks are going to make a significant percentage of my traffic stream, then I have to include the additional time it’s going to take to move each truck through the intersection. I can’t just make an assumption based on cars or I’ll end up with a huge congested mess and people calling me and asking what the hell I was thinking.\nThen of course, trucks impact how we design pavement! Trucks make a much larger impact on the asphalt and concrete than a typical car for one simple reason: they’re much heavier. So pavements have to be designed to handle the types and quantitiels of trucks that are expected.\nLastly, at least for this podcast, is noise and air pollution. Trucks make up a big part of the noise and air pollution that we transportation engineers have to take into account nowadays. It is possible that when designing a new roadway, the additional noise may be so great that we have to install soundwalls in order to avoid impacting the surroundings. Trucks add a lot to that noise level, so again, it’s important to know what type of vehilce is being designed for.\nAnd that’s it about trucks. There is more that I could discuss, getting into the juicy engineering details, but that covers all the basics.\nThanks for listening to talking traffic.

Drayage trucks are generally diesel-fueled, heavy-duty (Class 8) trucks that transport containers and bulk freight between the port and intermodal rail facilities, distribution centers, and other near-port locations. This page describes best practices, listed below, that port authorities, drayage truck drivers, and other port operators can adopt to reduce dray truck emissions.\n- Decrease the average age of the fleet\n- Reduce idle and creep time\n- Participate in the EPA SmartWay Program\n- Consider complementary rail and marine operations\n- Designate truck routes that avoid at-risk populations\nClean Air Best Practices: Appropriateness and Effectiveness\nThis webpage is one in a series of webpages that provide information on best practices at ports to reduce diesel pollution and associated health impacts. While the examples in these webpages are not exhaustive, they are intended to highlight some of the more effective strategies that have been adopted by U.S. ports. The appropriateness and effectiveness of these strategies will vary for different ports based on many factors, including type of operation, fleet makeup, local air quality and pollutant exposure, and community and port priorities. These webpages will be updated over time as new clean air practices emerge and information evolves.\nNewer trucks pollute significantly less than older model years due primarily to improved air emission control technologies installed on these trucks. Since 2007, diesel trucks have been equipped with diesel particulate filters (DPFs) and since 2010, many diesel trucks have been equipped with selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems. Alternative fuel drayage trucks are also an option to consider, especially as new truck models with low NOx tailpipe emissions (e.g., natural gas and liquid petroleum gas) and zero tailpipe emissions (e.g., electric and fuel cell) come into the market.\nRetiring older trucks and engines and replacing them with newer vehicles with the latest emission control technologies plays a major role in reducing air pollution at and near ports. While replacing any older truck with a newer one will yield emissions benefits, you can maximize benefits by replacing the oldest vehicles with the most mileage first and choosing a replacement truck with a model year 2014 or newer engine. Consistent with requirements in EPA’s DERA program, the vehicle you’re replacing should have accumulated at least 7,000 miles per year for the past two years and have at least three years of remaining life to ensure emissions benefits.\nChoosing the Right Trucks and Ensuring Good Maintenance\nWhile newer model year trucks are certified to meet cleaner emission standards, other important considerations when choosing a replacement truck include the following:\n- Tractors with aerodynamic fairings and low rolling resistance tires will save drivers fuel and reduce emissions. SmartWay designated tractors and trailers can maximize these efficiency savings, reducing fuel use by up to 20% (2,000 to 4,000 gallons of diesel per year).\n- Proper maintenance is critical to keeping trucks on the road. Requiring dealers to perform all engine checks and maintenance — such as compression and fuel injector tests, fuel and diesel exhaust fluid filter changes, and DPF cleaning — prior to sale will help drivers operate more fuel efficiently and avoid unforeseen costs. Monitoring trucks for visible smoke or illuminated check engine lights can help identify needed maintenance or repairs.\nAlternatives to Buying a Newer Truck\nFor older drayage trucks that you don’t plan to replace, consider installing diesel oxidation catalysts and low-rolling resistance tires. Both technologies can reduce emissions, and low-rolling resistance tires can save fuel costs.\n- EPA and Port Everglades Partnership: Emission Inventories and Reduction Strategies (PDF)(10 pp, 1.2 MB, June 2018, EPA-420-S-18-002)\n- EPA Clean Diesel Technologies\n- SmartWay Designated Tractors and Trailers\n- SmartWay Verified Low Rolling Resistance (LRR) New and Retread Tires\n- Zero-Emission Drayage Trucks: Challenges and Opportunities for the San Pedro Bay Ports (PDF)(60 pp, 2.1 MB, October 2019)\n- Port of Los Angeles Zero Emissions Technologies\n- How to Identify Low NOx Certified Engines Factsheet (PDF)(3 pp, 635 K, January 2021, EPA-420-F-21-002)\nTips on Performance Targets and Data Collection\n- Consider setting goals to increase the average engine model year of fleets servicing the port, or the percentage of the fleet that has a certain model year engine or newer.\n- Track the engine model year of the fleet of trucks that service the port via a truck registry and/or use Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tags, which are devices attached to trucks that transmit data via a radio signal to a receiver or reader typically located at the port or terminal gate.\n- Information and advice on determining engine model year can be found in the EPA Port Emissions Inventory Guidance: Methodologies for Estimating Port-Related and Goods Movement Mobile Source Emissions (PDF)(233 pp, 5 MB, September 2020, EPA-420-B-20-046) and this guide to determine engine model year from the California Air Resources Board.\nMany ports have clean truck programs that use grants and other funding to provide financial incentives to improve air quality through truck replacement.

Not only does unnecessary idling waste fuel, but it causes wear and tear on the engine that requires more frequent maintenance.\nIn addition to general idling policies, there are many strategies port operators can employ to reduce idle and creep time, including developing appointment systems; automating gates; extending gate hours; and operating during off-peak hours. These operational strategies can reduce emissions and traffic congestion while decreasing truck turn times at ports (i.e., transaction time to enter, load cargo, and depart the port).\nOperating during off-peak hours can increase flow and efficiency and reduce the impacts of diesel exhaust during peak ozone hours. Note that there are concerns associated with extended operating hours that include the additional labor needed to staff the terminals and gates at ports, as well as contract restrictions on off-peak labor. Extended hours may also be a concern to surrounding communities due to increased traffic during off-peak hours and may be restricted by noise or other local ordinances, so ports should seek community input when considering off-peak hour operations.\n- EPA List of Verified Idle Reduction Technologies for Trucks\n- Freight Advanced Traveler Information System (FRATIS) to promote urban freight mobility\n- Port Everglades On-port Truck Idle Reduction Scenario Analysis (PDF)(135 pp, 2.81 MB, June 2018, EPA-420-R-18-013)\nTips on Performance Targets and Data Collection\n- Consider setting goals to decrease the average time trucks spend creeping and/or idling.\n- Measure the average time a truck spends creeping or idling around port grounds as well as in queues to enter the port, following EPA Port Emissions Inventory Guidance: Methodologies for Estimating Port-Related and Goods Movement Mobile Source Emissions (PDF)(233 pp, 5 MB, September 2020, EPA-420-B-20-046).\n- If average truck creep and idle time is not available, setting goals to reduce the average turn time can be a good surrogate for reducing creep and idle time.\n- GCT Bayonne’s Drayage Truck Appointment System\n- Port of Los Angeles Terminal Equipment Idling Reduction Program (PDF)(93 pp, 4.6 MB, November 2017)\nEPA's SmartWay program helps truckers increase efficiency and fuel economy and provides them the documentation to prove it, giving them an advantage with prospective and current clients. If dray truck fleets that serve the port are not SmartWay partners, port operators can encourage them to join. Port operators also can encourage fleet operators to utilize SmartWay tools and resources to measure and improve performance. Additionally, port operators can reach out to known cargo owners and customers who are SmartWay shippers to encourage the dray truck carriers they work with to join and improve their performance.\n- SmartWay Carrier Application\n- SmartWay Truck Carrier Partner Resources\n- List of SmartWay Partners\n- SmartWay Carrier Performance Ranking List\nTips on Performance Targets and Data Collection\n- Consider setting a goal to increase the percent of dray trucks that serve the port that are SmartWay partners, and track progress by using SmartWay’s list of partners.\n- For those dray truck operators that are SmartWay partners, set goals to increase the performance ranking of each dray truck carrier that serves the port, and track progress using the SmartWay Carrier Performance Ranking List.\n- SmartWay Carrier Performance Rankings: Use this list to view the current SmartWay dray truck partners, along with the rest of the SmartWay carrier and 3rd Party Logistics partners.\n- SmartWay Dray Truck High Performers: This list contains the top 15% of all SmartWay dray truck partners for particulate matter and nitrogen oxides emissions.\nIncreasing use of locomotive and short-distance water transport operations can help a port increase the fraction of cargo moved by the most energy-efficient modes, alleviate landside congestion and reduce overall emissions, especially if combined with technologies and policies to minimize locomotive idling and barge emissions.\n- EPA and Port Everglades Partnership: Emission Inventories and Reduction Strategies (PDF)135 pp, 2.81 MB, June 2018, EPA-420-R-18-013)\n- Maritime Administration (MARAD's) Marine Highway Program\nTips on Performance Targets and Data Collection\n- Consider setting a goal to increase the amount of cargo moved by rail and short-distance vessels (e.g. as a percentage of overall cargo or ratio to cargo moved on trucks).\n- Track progress by measuring cargo (in tons or TEUs) moved in each mode.\n- Georgia Ports Authority: Inland Ports\n- James River Barge Service\n- North Atlantic Marine Highway’s Barge Service\nPorts can have a major impact on the air quality in nearby communities, particularly through increased truck traffic in the area. Port-related truck traffic increases emissions and air pollution, and can create additional noise and danger to people in the nearby area, particularly when trucks use residential side streets or other restricted roads. Port operators can work with community leaders and local planning and environmental agencies to develop designated truck routes that address many of these issues. Routes that avoid residential communities can reduce exposures to truck-related air pollution, as well as reduce the nuisance of truck noise for residents and increase safety. For example, it may be possible in some cases to route existing or projected traffic away from populated areas to an industrial setting (e.g., truck only routes). When trucks must be routed through or adjacent to communities, physical structures like sound walls and vegetative barriers between the road and the at-risk populations may be beneficial to reduce exposure to air pollutants (see the factors below concerning use of physical barriers).\nPort operators can also work with managers of buildings where at-risk populations spend significant amounts of time to implement mitigation strategies to reduce adverse health effects from exposures to air pollution, such as installing improved air filtration units within the buildings.\nWhen evaluating existing and alternative truck routes, factors that should be considered include:\n- Distance between the truck route and locations where potentially vulnerable populations, such as children and the elderly, spend significant amounts of time. Air pollutants emitted by trucks can be especially high within the first 500 feet of the road, so special attention should be paid to the number of these sensitive locations within this distance. These sensitive locations can include schools, daycares, parks, playgrounds, residences, health care facilities, and other public buildings like libraries.\n- Existence of physical barriers between these sensitive locations and the road. Research suggests that sound walls can reduce concentrations of traffic-related air pollutants immediately downwind of a roadway, although the extent of this reduction can vary by the wall height, length and distance from the road. Such barriers may also increase concentrations in the air on and immediately over the road as well as locations upwind and near the edges of the structure. If properly designed, vegetation barriers can be used to reduce near-road air pollution, either alone or in combination with solid structures like sound walls.\nAir quality modeling personnel at EPA Regional Offices and state and local air agencies can be consulted to help evaluate air pollution impacts to sensitive locations along existing and proposed truck routes.\nIt is also good practice to assess the rate of dray truck use of designated truck routes that avoid at-risk populations and to conduct outreach to truck operators to encourage greater usage.\n- Ports Primer: Chapter 5.1 Goods Movement and Transportation Planning for Truck Routes\n- Traffic Planning in Port Cities: International Transport Forum (PDF)(26 pp, 2.3 MB, September, 2018)\n- Recommendations for Constructing Roadside Vegetation Barriers to Improve Near-Road Air Quality\n- Best Practices for Reducing Near-Road Pollution Exposure at Schools\n- Near Roadway Air Pollution and Health: Frequently Asked Questions (PDF)(9 pp, 503 K, August 2014, EPA-420-F-14-044)\n- Research on Near Roadway and Other Near Source Air Pollution\n- Community-Port Collaboration Toolkit\n- Community-Port Collaboration Resources\n- Discussion of Truck Infrastructure Freight Routes in New Orleans Plan for the 21st Century (PDF)(18 pp, 1.1 MB)\n- West Oakland Truck Management Plan (PDF)(43 pp, 6.0 MB, May 2019)\n- Los Angeles County Strategic Goods Movement Arterial Plan (PDF) (30 pp, 1.5 MB, May 2015)"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:54f60966-a5e3-4d4f-8ef5-d96bfd906df1>","<urn:uuid:4015f349-0d71-42b8-803e-e5fb3d5123d7>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does authorization work differently between traditional physical access control and modern logical access control implementation?","answer":"Physical access control and logical access control differ in several key aspects of authorization. Traditional physical access control focuses on restricting physical entry through mechanical means, while logical access control, as implemented in systems like LDAP servers, provides more granular authorization capabilities. Specifically, logical access control can restrict not just access to resources (like physical access does), but also control which attributes and values a user can retrieve, how they can manipulate data, and bases decisions on multiple factors including authentication method, group membership, time of day, and network security. Physical access security historically relied more on mechanical devices with basic electronic components like solenoids, while logical access includes sophisticated features like policy enforcement points, policy decision points, and policy information points working together to make access decisions.","context":["Security Technology Executive editorial director Steve Lasky recently sat down with several of the industry’s top experts to find out what was trending and what issues were shaping the future of access control technology. Here is what they had to say:\nSTE: Like IP overtaking analog in the video sectors, how will traditional mechanical access control co-exist with new and emerging electronic and wireless access control advancements?\n- Jason Ouellette, Tyco Security Products: In today’s market, brand new systems are more commonly being specified as full IP systems with the support of an electronic credential. There are a large number of legacy installations presently in use and once they reach the end of their 10-20 year life cycles in the access control industry, fully IP security systems will likely replace them with cloud based options and electronic credentials. So while serial communications currently accounts for roughly 60 percent of access control sales, IP will eventually eclipse serial based sales as these legacy systems are replaced and become antiquated.”\n- Julian Lovelock, HID Global: With the adoption of mobile access control, cards and phones are already converging into centralized identity management systems. The ultimate objective goes beyond supporting both form factors, though. Even more valuable is the ability to use either form factor -- or both -- to secure access to the door, to data, and to cloud applications, while providing a seamless user experience. Developments in converged back-of-house technologies are enabling strong authentication and card management capabilities for computer and network logon while also ensuring that physical and logical identities can be managed on a combination of plastic cards, smartphones and other mobile devices.\n- Peter Boriskin, ASSA ABLOY: Historically, electromechanical devices were simply mechanical devices with solenoids or other basic electronic components incorporated into them. Recently we have seen significant advances in the capabilities of electromechanical devices with products like ASSA ABLOY’s EcoFlex electrified mortise locks. Built on the same foundation, they share common aesthetics and security features with our mechanical locks, allowing them to co-exist seamlessly in the same facility. Additionally, improvements in the technology of electromechanical hardware has allowed us to merge electromechanical hardware with innovations like low power wireless. By combining these ideas, we are able to create much more advanced products without compromising security.\n- David Ella, AMAG Technology: For applications with a lower need than 100% online availability such as dorm rooms at universities, we are finding an increased demand in wireless locks. Access control products are integrating with wireless lock products to meet the diverse demands of customers who need both technologies to effectively secure buildings.\n- Ajay Jain. Quantum Secure: When ‘IP only’ video devices emerged, hybrid systems appeared that could handle both analog and IP devices. Initially seen as a transitional stopgap, it looks now that hybrid systems will stick around – there are even new analog cameras being introduced for some applications. In a similar way, access control technologies and systems that can connect legacy and modern systems will see quick growth. Some applications will transition to emerging technologies, and some will remain a hybrid of old and new for some time. Management systems will need to support both.\n- John Szczygiel, Brivo: Electronic and wireless access controls will compliment and extend the traditional metal key but not replace them for quite a while. The newer technologies will enable more openings to become part of the automated access control systems. The exciting trend here is towards ultra-low power wireless devices. The extended battery life of these devices will make many more applications in physical security very practical.\n- Mitchell Kane, Vanderbilt Industries: Delivering the best solutions for our end-users will necessitate embracing new technologies and supporting the expanded functionality/utility that these new technologies offer. To be successful, we must adapt our software to accept the integration of new devices all the while maintaining a logical user interface. From an end user’s perspective, this means keeping the programming of disparate devices constant with core products, the only real distinction should be how and when data is updated at the remote devices. The trend of co-existence between traditional mechanical access control and emerging electronic and wireless access control is all about consistency among these technologies across multiple systems, allowing users to streamline installation, service and maintenance, and easily expand their access control network when needed.\nSTE: Are the increased standards pressures by organizations like PSIA and ONVIF realistically migrating the access control industry to a true open architecture IP-based intelligent controller environment? If so, how is your technology roadmap designed for future adopters?\n- Jason Ouellette: Our roadmap has always been focused on adopting these standards, where they make sense, to ensure that our products have the ability to talk to readers from multiple solution providers. This quite simply protects the customer’s investment which we fully take note of. OSDP is one of the more aggressive open standards that we see moving into the industry, addressing communication between the reader and controllers and can support both legacy serial based communications as well as the newer IP based solutions.Tyco Security Products has also recently participated in a PSIA demonstration of the PLAI Agent, showing how a an Active Directory LDAP based logical identity can drive a physical credential across multiple physical access control system (PACS) providers We are well in tune to the need for convergence of logical and physical identity management. It will be difficult to see a fast and widespread adoption in access control though until more legacy systems are replaced with IP based solutions. Until then, there will be certain limits on how much standardization can occur. Reconciling these competing technologies will inevitably change the direction of the access control market and will really spur the further development of access control standards.\n- Peter Boriskin: We sit on the boards of both PSIA and ONVIF. We take standards very seriously and value being part of these organizations. Standardization is important in the security industry and we design our products to be integrated into a standards-based eco-system. I think there is a level of caution from those in the security industry around these standards, especially how we develop proper testing and ensuring the standards are comprehensive. Addressing these two areas will be critical moving forward.\n- Scott Lindley, Farpointe Data: Standards have long played a role in access control and will continue to build momentum. For example, to enable broader compatibility with a broader range of access control panels, many RFID readers and credentials first emulated magnetic stripe data standards developed by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). These standards defined many of the reader and card attributes, such as data formats, timing and physical size. Today, many access control panel providers comply with the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) standard IEEE 802.3 which defines the backbone of open architecture Ethernet technologies. New standards, such as the Open Supervised Device Protocol (OSDP) specification which offers the promise of widespread functional integration of disparate card readers, access control panels and other security management systems, will allow for new features and even greater interoperability.\n- Frank Gasztonyi, Mercury Security: The notion that there can be an open architecture, IP-based intelligent controller that is based on PSIA, ONVIF, or any other standards body is misguided. This is due to the fact that “intelligent controllers” deliver constantly evolving solutions to diverse problems, which means the blueprint for how manufacturers should meet their customers’ needs will never lend itself to be defined by a standards body or committee. At the same time, the industry cannot overlook standards that facilitate the transfer of data, rather than what do with it. As such, utilizing and supporting standards continue to be an important part of Mercury’s roadmap. We have implemented and deployed several multi-party solutions based on PSIA, OSDP and other standards accordingly.\n- Robert Laughlin, Galaxy Control Systems: These are extremely positive goals, and PSIA and OnVIF are certainly committed to this process. Wrangling dozens of manufacturers is complex; however we do believe that overall the industry recognizes that it is in the best interest of our customers to work towards the goal together.\n- David Ella: Someone once said that the great thing about standards is that there are so many to choose from, and that’s very true of physical security. AMAG is more interested in standards that increase physical and cyber security than opening up access control systems through published protocols. Going forward the end-to-end integrity and security of the system is going to be the most important thing to ward off cyber-attacks. The real openness that most systems need is at the software level and we heavily promote integrations using secure XML web services.\n- Ajay Jain: No, the standards aren’t creating pressures - it’s the customers, because they are no longer willing to use closed systems. More and more, they now insist on open architecture for their security and access control systems to ensure that they can pick best-of-class system elements that will work together. This is true at every level of their solution from card and readers, to management reporting, and to the “things” that are beginning to emerge from the Internet of Things. Providers that aren’t open to supporting these standards risk being viewed as outdated and unwelcome with many customers.\n- John Szczygiel: This will be a reality when there is wider adoption of the full standards, assuming that the standards are responsive to the needs of the market. In the near term, most systems will continue to take the walled garden approach, balancing specific customer needs with the potential for interoperability offered by the standards. In the interim we’re seeing a positive move away from custom integrations per sub-system to an Application Programming Interface (API) type of approach that is so common in the IT world. This provides the ability for systems to be modular and extensible and yet full featured.\n- Mitchell Kane: Open architecture is an often discussed, highly desirable feature for end users who want to feel comfortable not being committed to a single system for a lifetime. Things change and needs evolve; it is nice to be able to upgrade access control software and have it communicate with all existing panels and smart locks without the need for rewiring and replacing hardware – similar to moving from one VMS system to another. Unfortunately, unlike the IT world, this market has been historically protectionistic; camera manufacturers more readily accepted standards such as ONVIF in the video market. We have to remember that this market has always been driven by standards, such as NTSC or PAL. Today, there is a big movement underway toward the responsible decision to not only integrate with proprietary manufactured boards but also with de facto industry open products (such as Mercury Security). Our road map has always been to adapt to standards as they are ratified. In the meantime, with the market influx of smart locks from various companies, this market appears to be in the proprietary protocol mode and will be for many years to come.","Overview#Access Control (or Privilege Management) is a process where an Authoritative Entity (Trustor) who grants a permission to a Trustee\nAccess Control is typically implemented within an Access Control Service\nAccess Control decides \"Who\" can do \"What\" on which Resourcees\nThe action of Access Control may be referred to as Resource Provisioning\nAccess Control may (and probably should) use a Policy Based Management System\nAccess Control Importance#Access Control is the primary reason we perform all of the following activities:\nAccess Control Process#Access Control is defined within a Access Control Policy and enforced by a Policy Enforcement Point based on the decision from the the Policy Decision Point which has acquired information from a Policy Retrieval Point and Policy Information Points.

The central purpose of HSPA is to assess whether progress is being made towards desired goals and whether appropriate activities are undertaken to promote achievement of those goals.\nBefore elaborating on the concept of health system performance assessment (HSPA) further, it is helpful to first shed some light on the different concepts and terminology related to this topic. The following table illustrates the differences between a ‘healthcare system’ and a ‘health system.’\nTable 1. The difference between a healthcare system and a health system, and between healthcare system performance and health system performance\nHealthcare system Combined functioning of public health and personal healthcare services that are under the direct control of identifiable agents, especially ministries of health.\nHealthcare system performance The efficiency and equitability of the professional public health and personal healthcare services within a system, including a cost-benefit analysis.\nHealth system All activities and structures that determine or influence health in its broadest sense within a given society. This also includes social, environmental and economic determinants of health.\nHealth system performance A broader concept that also acknowledges the broad range of determinants of population health that are not directly related to healthcare service delivery. It embraces the notion that the health status of a population is only partly influenced by the quality of the available healthcare services, and that there are many other social, cultural, political, economic, environmental, educational and demographic factors influencing population health.\nThere are three distinct strengths to a health system performance assessment compared to a healthcare system performance assessment, namely:\n- A health system performance assessment embodies a holistic approach. The whole system is incorporated, and the assessment surpasses the narrow scope of just the healthcare system.\n- Involvement of all stakeholders is possible. It gives the various agents a sense of ownership and responsibility, and helps them to make informed decisions.\n- There is a strong emphasis on the overarching objectives of health systems.\nFive key characteristics of HSPA\nThere are 5 key characteristics for adequately applying the concept of health system performance assessment (HSPA). HSPA should be:\n- Regular: Assessing the performance of a health system is a continuous and iterative process.\n- Systematic: The approach should be structured and consistent.\n- Transparent: The assessment has to be clear, unambiguous and understandable for others.\n- Comprehensive: The whole system should be covered. Furthermore, we have to be aware that the performance of a system does not simply equal the sum of the performance of its various components.\n- Analytical: Complementary sources of information should be consulted to obtain a comprehensive and well-founded overview of the health system’s performance. Quantitative indicators should be supported by qualitative insights, just like performance indicators should be supported by a policy analysis. HSPA is in essence a comparative evaluation, and the reference points for comparison have to be chosen wisely. Some relevant reference points for comparison could be:\n- Developments over time\n- Local, regional, national or international differences\n- Differences between population groups (e.g. based on age, gender, income, SES etc.)\n- Comparisons to certain targets or benchmarks\nThe WHO Health Systems Framework\nThe WHO states that a health system consists of all organizations, people and actions whose primary objective is to promote, restore or maintain health. The WHO has developed a model which is comprised of six building blocks. Collectively, these six building blocks represent the ‘complete’ health system. The building blocks are illustrated in the following figure.\nFigure 1. The six health system building blocks of the WHO\n- Service delivery: This represents the effectiveness, safety and the quality of health interventions. It means that health interventions are available to whoever needs them, regardless of where and when they are needed, with minimum waste of resources.\n- Health workforce: A professional health workforce is responsive, fair and efficient in achieving the best possible health outcomes, making optimal use of the available resources and given circumstances. There should be an adequate number and diversity of competent, productive and responsive medical professionals, distributed fairly amongst society.\n- Health information system: A well-functioning health information system ensures the production, analysis, dissemination and use of reliable and up-to-date information on health determinants, health system performance and health status.\n- Access to Essential Medicines: Essential medical products, vaccines and technologies should be equitably accessible to the population. These medical provisions should be of guaranteed quality, safety, efficacy and cost-effectiveness.\n- Financing: Adequate funding for health should be ensured, to make sure citizens can obtain needed services. Citizens should be protected from disproportionate financial losses when obtaining health services.\n- Stewardship/Governance: Also called leadership. It involves establishing strategic policy frameworks in which effective oversight, coalition-building, adequate regulations and incentives, and accountability issues are all properly implemented and addressed.\nWhich dimensions and indicators to choose for HSPA?\nAn indicator is appropriate for inclusion in a HSPA if 5 critera are met, as illustrated in table 2 below.\nTable 2. The 5 criteria that make an indicator suitable for inclusion in a HSPA (source: Veilard et al. 2010)\nImportance The indicator reflects critical aspects of health system functioning\nRelevance The indicator provides information that is useful for monitoring and measuring health system performance for an extended time period\nFeasibility The required data are readily available or can be obtained with reasonable efforts\nReliability The indicator produces consistent results\nValidity The indicator is an accurate reflection of the dimension it is supposed to represent\nTo conclude, table 3 provides an overview of potentially relevant dimensions, including several exemplary indicators per dimension.\nTable 3. Exemplary dimensions and indicators for HSPA\nDimension Exemplary indicators\nAccess - Physicians per 1000 inhabitants\n- Waiting time for an appointment with a GP or medical specialist\n- Waiting time for an donor organ\n- Geographic coverage of GP practices (percentage of people that are within a 20 minute drive from a GP)\nQuality - Immunization rates\n- Five year survival rates for breast, cervix and colon cancer\n- Percentage of patients treated in accordance with evidence-based guidelines\nSafety - Rate of MRSA infections\n- Percentage of patients in long-term care facilities with decubitus\n- Percentage of patients experiencing side-effects of medication\nEquity - Life expectancy at birth\n- Avoidable mortality\n- Health service utilisation\n- Differences per gender, age group, income, living area, SES\nFairness - Government spending on health as a percentage of total government spending\n- Total household out-of-pocket payments\n- Health insurance affordability and coverage\nContinuity - Support after leaving the hospital\n- Percentage of chronically ill patients experiencing coordination problems with medical tests\n- Patients enrolled in disease management programs\n- Patients receiving contradictory information from different healthcare providers\nEfficiency - Average length of hospital stay\n- Percentage of surgeries in day-clinics\nResponsiveness - General satisfaction with the healthcare system\n- Patient-perceived interpersonal contact\n- Patient involvement in decision-making processes\n- Patient-doctor interaction (explanations, possibility for asking questions, check-up telephone calls)\nSustainability - Healthcare expenditure as percentage of GDP\nPopulation health - Healthy life years\n- Infant mortality\n- Obesity rates\n- Ischaemic heart disease rates\n- Self-perceived health\n- Veillard J, Huynh T, Ardal S, Kadandale S, Klazinga NS, Brown AD.

{"question":"What are the key differences in the discernment process between joining a Buddhist monastery versus a Catholic seminary?","answer":"The discernment process for both paths shares some similarities but has distinct differences. For Buddhist monastics, the process involves first deciding on a specific Buddhist tradition (Theravada, Zen, etc.), visiting 2-3 monasteries for a few weeks each, and then making a longer 3-month commitment to get past the 'honeymoon stage' and truly evaluate the fit. Financial preparation and readiness to give up career/property for a 3-5 year experiment are essential. For Catholic seminary candidates, the process emphasizes deep prayer with the Holy Spirit, consulting spiritual directors and ecclesiastical authorities, attending vocations events and discernment groups, and undergoing formal evaluations through Annual Reviews. The Catholic path also includes a structured 7-9 year formation program with four pillars: Human, Intellectual, Spiritual and Pastoral, and continues even after ordination through promises of obedience to bishops or religious superiors.","context":["dedicated to a peaceful & just society\ngrounded in contemplative & spiritual practice\nI receive many inquiries about ordaining as Buddhist monks and nuns, even tho I haven't been a monk for almost 4 years now! I hope this page will provide some practical guidance.\nBecome a Buddhist monastic is a gradual process that requires patience. I know men who have hurried into it; in many cases that did not work out for the best, whether for them or the monastic communities (such as mine) that had to deal with their impatience. On the other hand, people who have a true monastic calling can take their time (tho not dawdling) and make wise choices. They become mature monks and nuns, and their communities are enriched by their life, practice, and service.\nHere are some steps that I suggest you follow. These suggestions are written for both men and women. At the end are additional considerations for women (equality is not the status quo).\nDecide the orientation of your practice & understanding of Buddhism. Is it primarily Theravada? Zen? Tibetan? Chinese Ch'an? Within that tradition (there's diversity in all the major schools), which flavors of teaching & practice (e.g. Thai forest or Tibetan Nyingma) are most meaningful for you?\nFind out which monastic teachers in that tradition and flavor have training monasteries able to accommodate foreigners. (Some do and some don't. Those that don't lack, for instance, English speaking teachers and translators, or unknowingly impose too much of the local culture.) Nowadays, you may find some of these teachers living in the West; others are based in Asia. Which of these teachers inspire you enough to possibly live in obedience to them for a number of years?\nVisit 2 or 3 of those monasteries. Spend a few weeks in each. (This may be a large investment of time and money for you, but it is important.) Find out if they actually train young monks & nuns, or do they just let you do your own thing. Do they follow Vinaya sufficiently?\nWhen you find a place that suits you and supports the kind of training you need (including Dhamma, meditation, & Vinaya), return for a at least a 3 month visit. 3 months is necessary for getting past the \"honeymoon stage\" in which you fall in love with the place and don't notice the warts. It won't be till you notice the limits & weaknesses (which every place has, including monasteries) that you can balance those with the strengths & positive qualities, and can make a wise decision. If you are overly idealistic about a place, you will be disappointed and may end up bitter.\nFind out what that monastery requires of ordination candidates. Begin the process. It might take a while.\nI hope this is helpful for you. These are broad guidelines.\nSome one like myself can not advise intelligently regarding the latter steps until you provide more information on the first, then proceed step by step from there.\nBuddhist monastic communities are usually hierarchal, whether in Asia or the West. Even when no monks are present, their influence may be substantial. If you expect equal treatment, you will be frustrated.\nA few monastic communities have made serious attempts to minimize gender hierarchy and patriarchy. If you have any feminist inclinations, you might want to check these out first.\nMore information from the Sakyadhita website.\nAre you prepared to sacrifice some of your individuality (habits, opinions, status) in order to fit into a healthy Sangha?\nAre your financial matters in order?\nIf you are over 30, are you ready for the physical hardships of monastic life, especially in the poorer Buddhist countries? Do you have health issues or special needs?\nAre you prepared to give up a career & property for a 3-5 year experiment (in case you drop out)?","Vocational formation and the new evangelization: Ongoing discernment\nThe 35-year old lawyer asks himself, “Do I leave the job that I love, sell my condo, and give up the life that I have been living to enter the Seminary? After all, I have been thinking about the priesthood since grade school.”\nThe 21-year old college student at the local state university has been volunteering on the weekends with a group of religious sisters visiting the sick, the elderly and the homebound. Although she has been excited about a career as an accountant, she is now wondering if God is calling her to be a religious sister serving the poor and the sick.\nThe senior at the Catholic high school is asked by his friends which colleges he is applying to. “None,” he answers confidently. “I’ve been talking to my pastor and I think I’m going to apply to the Seminary for next Fall.”\nDiscernment is the prayerful consideration that one undertakes when confronted with an important life decision. It is not necessary, for example, to discern whether one goes for Italian or Chinese food tonight for dinner. You may do a Google Search to see which restaurant has the better rating or you may ask your spouse which one they prefer, but ultimately a decision is made. There is no need to invoke the Holy Spirit about your dining location of preference!\nHowever, when considering important life decisions — whether and whom to marry; whether to accept a new job on the other side of the country; whether to buy a first home — these are decisions that should be accompanied by an appropriate time of discernment. Hopefully such decisions are not made hastily or under duress, seeing as they have important consequences, positive or negative, for one’s life.\nSo, too, when considering a vocation to the priesthood or religious life. This is what we call discerning one’s vocation. And the process of discernment should contain most of the following elements:\n—Deep prayer, continually asking the Holy Spirit to provide you with clarity and peace.\n—Trust in God that He will, in time, reveal His will for you.\n—The desire to serve God and His Church for life in this specific vocation.\n—Speaking to your parents, family and friends (as is appropriate, depending on your family circumstances).\n—Educating and informing yourself about the life of the seminary or convent, about the apostolates and charisms of the diocese or religious order.\n—Speaking to a diocesan vocation director or religious vocation director; attending relevant vocations events, including Come & See retreats and discernment groups.\n—Being patient with God and with yourself as the discernment process runs its course, always docile the promptings of the Holy Spirit and to the decisions of the appropriate Ecclesiastical authorities, that is, of the diocese or particular religious order.\nYour process of discernment should also contain the following questions:\n—What is your motivation for embracing this vocation? Selfless service? Pride and vainglory?\n—Is this vocation something that brings you feelings of joy, peace and fulfillment?\n—Have you consulted trusted spiritual guides — a spiritual director, trusted priests and religious that you know, other members of the parish who know you well?\n—Have you prayerfully considered if a life of chaste and celibate living, in addition to a simple lifestyle, is for you?\n—Are you ready for a life of joyful sacrifice for the building up of God’s Kingdom as a priest or religious?\nThe need for constant discernment\nThis process of prayerful discernment does not end with one’s acceptance into the seminary or convent. While the content of the discernment will certainly change over time, the need for constant discernment does not change. Why?\nFor the Archdiocese of Los Angeles, as we have shared in previous articles in this series, the formation program in the seminary lasts from seven to nine years. Each seminarian must continue to discern his call to the priesthood throughout each phase of seminary formation. The 4 Pillars of Priestly Formation — Human, Intellectual, Spiritual and Pastoral — seek to integrate each of these essential areas of formation as the seminarian advances toward ordination.\nTogether with the guidance and support of his spiritual director and formation advisor, the seminarian ought to be growing and maturing in each of the 4 Pillars of Formation, while at the same time continuing to perceive the call of God within his heart that this indeed is still his true vocation.\nIt will happen at times that a seminarian will come to the prayerful conclusion, having consulted his spiritual director and formation advisor, that he is requesting a leave of absence (for a determined period of time) or withdrawal from seminary formation. Ideally this has been a well-discerned decision, taking into account both the objective and subject factors that have led the seminarian to this decision.\nAt the same time, each seminarian undergoes an Annual Review. The Annual Review process includes consultations and evaluations by the seminary faculty and peer reviews to determine his suitability for advancing to the next year of seminary formation.\nIt also happens at times that this Annual Review process, which includes the active participation of each individual seminarian in his own Annual Review, results in the seminary faculty’s determination that the seminarian should take a leave of absence or withdrawal from the seminary formation program. Such a decision is never the result of a sudden or reactive decision (except in the case of an egregious violation of seminary or archdiocesan policies). Rather, the seminarian will have been well aware of both his strengths and areas of growth.\nThus, significant areas of concern that have arisen in previous Annual Reviews and that have not be addressed satisfactorily may warrant such a dismissal from Seminary Formation. The Annual Review process takes place with transparency and in the fairest manner possible.\nThus, the process of discernment always takes places within in an Ecclesiastical context. Each person must prayerfully discern his own vocation and the signs that point to an authentic call from God. This decision must be made freely, without any outside pressure or duress.\nAt the same time, the Church also discerns — according to the precepts of Pastoris Dabo Vobis and the Program for Priestly Formation, 5th Edition — whether each candidate or seminarian ought to begin or continue in his seminary formation toward ordination as a priest.\nAnd lest one think that discernment ends with one’s priestly ordination or perpetual vows as a religious, the process of discernment, constitutive as it is of the Christian life, continues throughout one’s life and ministry.\nDiocesan priests make a promise of respect and obedience to their bishop. Religious sisters, brothers and priests make a vow of obedience to their religious superior. Just as the bishop or religious superior continually discerns God’s will for the welfare of their diocese or religious congregation, so too does each priest and religious continually discern how they will live out their ordination or religious vows faithfully, joyfully, and according to God’s will and for the building up of God’s Kingdom among them.\nMay the Holy Spirit continue to enlighten the hearts and minds for all men and women in discernment, each seminarian and religious in formation in the seminary or convent, and all priests and fully professed religious sisters, brothers, and priests as they serve God’s people in the Church.\nMay the Blessed Virgin Mary, to whom they are all consecrated to in special way, guide and protect them always.\nBY REV.

{"question":"What are the scientific mechanisms behind left-handed amino acid formation in meteorites, and how does the 1998 meteorite discovery expand our understanding of extraterrestrial organic compounds?","answer":"Left-handed amino acid formation in meteorites occurs through multiple mechanisms. Initially, polarized radiation in the solar nebula may create a small excess of left-handed amino acids. This excess can then be amplified through crystallization and dissolution in liquid water within asteroids. Some amino acids, like aspartic acid, can form pure crystals that amplify initial left-handed excess, while others form mixed crystals of both types. The 1998 Monahans and Zag meteorites further expanded this understanding by revealing a complex array of organic compounds within salt crystals, including amino acids, hydrocarbons, and elements like carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. These meteorites, which may have originated from the asteroid belt's Ceres or Hebe, demonstrate that water-rich parent bodies can generate and preserve organic compounds necessary for life.","context":["July 26, 2012\nTagish Lake Meteorites Reveals Secrets Of The Early Solar System\nLee Rannals for redOrbit.com - Your Universe Online\nNew clues have been unveiled that shed light on why living things use only molecules with specific orientations.Research analyzing meteorite fragments that fell on a frozen lake in Canada is providing strong evidence that liquid water inside an asteroid leads to a preference of left-handed over right-handed forms of common protein amino acids in meteorites.\n\"Our analysis of the amino acids in meteorite fragments from Tagish Lake gave us one possible explanation for why all known life uses only left-handed versions of amino acids to build proteins,\" Dr. Daniel Glavin of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and lead author of a paper being published in the journal Meteoritics and Planetary Science, said in a press release.\nA meteorite landed on Earth back in January 2000, and because many people witnessed the event, pieces were able to be collected and preserved in their frozen state for research.\n\"The Tagish Lake meteorite continues to reveal more secrets about the early Solar System the more we investigate it,\" Dr. Christopher Herd, a co-author on the paper, said. \"This latest study gives us a glimpse into the role that water percolating through asteroids must have played in making the left-handed amino acids that are so characteristic of all life on Earth.\"\nProteins are used in everything from structures like hair to enzymes, and are the catalysts that speed up or regulate chemical reactions. Life uses just 20 different amino acids in a variety of arrangements to build millions of different proteins.\nAmino acid molecules can be built in two ways that are mirror images of each other, and although life based on right-handed amino acids would presumably work fine, they cannot be mixed.\n\"Synthetic proteins created using a mix of left- and right-handed amino acids just don't work,\" Dr. Jason Dworkin of NASA Goddard, co-author of the study, said.\nBecause life is unable to function with a mix of left- and right-handed amino acids, scientists are trying to know how life got set up with the left-handed ones.\n\"The handedness observed in biological molecules — left-handed amino acids and right-handed sugars — is a property important for molecular recognition processes and is thought to be a prerequisite for life,\" Dworkin said.\nThe team used the meteorite samples and mixed them into a hot-water solution, then separated and identified the molecules in them using a liquid chromatograph mass spectrometer.\n\"We discovered that the samples had about four times as many left-handed versions of aspartic acid as the opposite hand,\" says Glavin.\nAspartic acid is an amino acid that is used in every enzyme in the human body, and is also used to make sugar substitute Aspartame.\n\"Interestingly, the same meteorite sample showed only a slight left-hand excess (no more than eight percent) for alanine, another amino acid used by life,\" he added.\nHe said that at first, the findings did not make sense because if both amino acids come from contamination by terrestrial life, both should have large left-handed excesses.\n\"However, a large left-hand excess in one and not the other tells us that they were not created by life but instead were made inside the Tagish Lake asteroid,\" Glavin said.\nThe team was able to confirm that amino acids were most likely created in space using isotope analysis.\nIsotopes are elements with different masses, and since the chemistry of life prefers lighter isotopes, amino acids that have a heavier isotope like carbon 13 were likely created in space.\n\"We found that the aspartic acid and alanine in our Tagish Lake samples were highly enriched in carbon 13, indicating they were probably created by non-biological processes in the parent asteroid,\" Dr. Jamie Elsila of NASA Goddard, a co-author on the paper who performed the isotopic analysis, said.\nThe research marks the first time carbon isotope measurements have been reported for these amino acids in Tagish Lake. The carbon 13 enrichment, combined with the left-hand excess in aspartic acid, provides strong evidence that some left-handed proteinogenic amino acids can be produced in excess in asteroids.\nSome say that large left-handed amino acid access in meteorites formed by exposure to polarized radiation in the solar nebula, however these are so large they cannot be explained by this alone. The team believes that another process would be required.\nThe large left-hand excess found in aspartic acid and not alanine gave the team a critical clue as to how these amino acids could have been made inside the asteroid.\n\"One thing that jumped out at me was that alanine and aspartic acid can crystallize differently when you have mixtures of both left-handed and right-handed molecules,\" Dr. Aaron Burton, a NASA Postdoctoral Program Fellow at NASA Goddard and a co-author on the study, said. \"This led us to find several studies where researchers have exploited the crystallization behavior of molecules like aspartic acid to get left-handed or right-handed excesses.\"\nHe said that because alanine forms different types of crystals, these processes would produce equal amounts of left- and right-handed alanine.\n\"We need to do some more experiments, but this explanation has the potential to explain what we see in the Tagish Lake meteorite and other meteorites,\" Burton added.\nThe team believes a small left-hand excess could get amplified by crystallization and dissolution from a saturated solution with liquid water. Some amino acids have a shape that allows them to come together in a pure crystal form. These amino acids have a small initial left- and right-hand excess that could become greatly amplified at the expense of the opposite-handed crystals.\nOther amino acids have a shape that prefers to join together with their mirror image to make a crystal, which are comprised of equal numbers of left- and right-handed molecules. As these crystals grow, any small initial excess would be washed out for these amino acids.\nBoth of these processes can convert to left-handed to right-handed molecules, and vice-versa while they dissolve in the solution.\nThe process only amplifies a small excess that already exists. The team said that polarized ultraviolet light or other types of radiation from nearby stars may fair the creation of left-handed amino acids or the destruction of right-handed ones. This left-hand excess could then get amplified in asteroids by processes like crystallization.\nImpacts by asteroids and meteorites could help deliver this material to Earth, and left-handed amino acids may have been incorporated in emerging life due to their greater abundance. Similar enrichments of left-handed amino acids by crystallizations could have taken place on Earth in ancient sediments that had water flowing through them, the team said.\n\"Since it appears a non-biological process can create a left-hand excess in some kinds of amino acids, we can't use such an excess alone as proof of biological activity,\" Glavin said.","In 1998, a pair of meteorites said to be about 4.5-billion-years-old crashed into our planet, landing in opposite parts of the world months apart from each other. And it took two decades before scientists discovered that the meteorites have the so-called “ingredients” for the recipe of life, as documented in a new study.\nIn a study published earlier this week in the journal, Science Advances, a team of researchers revealed the surprising findings from the analysis of two meteorites that may have been a part of our solar system’s asteroid belt for more than 4 billion years before making their way to Earth. According to a report from CNN, the first meteorite was found in Texas in March, 1998, and was followed by another, which landed in August of that year near Morocco. The meteorites, which were codenamed Monahans and Zag, are said to be the first of their kind to have several ingredients for life present, including liquid water, hydrocarbons, amino acids, and various organic compounds.\nWhile both meteorites appear to have similar features, particularly bluish salt crystals, these crystals weren’t always included in the objects’ makeup. The researchers believe that they originated from water and ice that erupted from volcanoes, which is similar to what takes place in our solar system’s ocean worlds. It was also found that the objects might have crossed paths with each other, well before they fell to Earth.\nStudy author Queenie Chan, a postdoctorate research associate at the United Kingdom’s Open University, believes that the organic matter found in the meteorites may have come from one of these ocean worlds, specifically the brown dwarf planet Ceres.\n“Our coordinated organic analysis of the salt crystals suggest that the organic matter originated from a water-rich, or previously water-rich parent body,” she commented.\nAside from Ceres, which is the largest known object in our asteroid belt, CNN pointed out that the asteroid Hebe is another possible source for the Monahans and Zag meteorites, as it has been suspected to be the source of a number of other meteorites that had previously crashed to Earth.\nAlthough it was easy to obtain samples from the Zag and Monahans meteorites, as they were both kept at NASA’s Johnson Space Center, studying the objects was a different story. As explained by Newsweek, the scientists meticulously analyzed the samples, using a number of intricate processes to ensure that they didn’t get contaminated. Amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins, were evident in the Zag sample, while the salt crystals from the Monahans sample were found to have carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, three elements that are well known for being among the many ingredients for life.\nWhile the scientists were able to find many key ingredients for life in the meteorites, the findings are not to be confused as a sign that there is absolutely some form of alien life beyond our planet. But they could offer some guidance to researchers hoping to learn more about the early days of objects like Jupiter’s moon, Europa, and Saturn’s moon, Enceladus, which have both been suspected to have features and chemistries capable of sustaining some form of life.\n“Our finding that the meteorites contain a wide diversity of organic compounds is exciting, but what made me jump up and down was that we were able to investigate the soluble – such as amino acids, the building blocks of life – and insoluble organic compounds contained within the tiny salt crystals,” said Chan, as quoted by CNN."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d1959928-05a6-48ce-bafe-c7e7108e26f6>","<urn:uuid:5f7cdaaa-fc6e-4716-a3f0-c23c7e22ea5f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"¿Cuál es la relación entre los programas de apoyo laboral para personas con discapacidad y las intervenciones terapéuticas para la depresión en términos de efectividad?","answer":"Workplace support programs and therapeutic interventions for depression work in complementary ways. Workplace support includes practical accommodations (like flexible start times and written instructions), employee resource groups, and comprehensive insurance coverage including mental health services. These supports help create an inclusive environment where employees feel comfortable disclosing their disabilities. On the therapeutic side, interventions include medications (antidepressants) and various forms of psychotherapy (interpersonal therapy, psychodynamic therapy, and cognitive-behavioral therapy). While medications provide symptom relief, psychotherapies address underlying causes, particularly helping with social isolation and relationship building. The most effective approach combines both workplace support and therapeutic interventions, as workplace accommodations provide practical assistance while therapy addresses the underlying mental health challenges.","context":["The World Health Organisation (WHO) describes the term “disability” as covering “impairments, activity limitations and participation restrictions”. Being born with, or acquiring, a disability can be life-altering and bring significant obstacles to everyday life. Life with a disability can be made even more difficult by having to deal with a significant amount of stigma associated with disability.\nEmployers have a duty of care to ensure disabled workers can overcome any substantial barrier to completing their work and progressing, as well as thriving, in their careers. When it comes to recruitment, disabled individuals need to have the same chance as those who are non-disabled at being awarded a job. Anything that makes a job inaccessible to a disabled candidate needs to be modified to make recruitment equal and fair, particularly to deliver on an organisation’s commitment to DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion).\n“Visible disabilities are immediately discernible. Whereas a non-visible disability is not immediately obvious.”\nWhat differentiates visible and non-visible disabilities?\nVisible disabilities are immediately discernable. Whereas a non-visible disability is not immediately obvious. Thus, observed at face value, non-visible disabilities may defy stereotypes of what people think a person’s appearance or normal conduct ought to be. Certain developmental disabilities, such as ADHD or an autism spectrum disorder, may be particularly undetectable and so can lead to misunderstanding – unless one gets to spend more time with the affected person. It is important to emphasise that even though a disability cannot be seen, it does not mean it does not exist.\nWhich disabilities are non-visible?\nA non-visible disability can be described as a physical, mental or neurological condition that is not visible from the outside, yet can limit or challenge a person’s cognitive abilities, senses, physical agility or activities. Non-visible disabilities can have side effects that affect the way the individual thinks, hears, speaks or interacts with others. Non-visible disabilities include a wide range of disabilities, which may include:\n- mental health conditions, including anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, personality disorders, obsessive compulsive disorder,\n- autism and Asperger’s Syndrome,\n- visual impairments or restricted vision,\n- hearing loss,\n- sensory and processing difficulties,\n- cognitive impairment, including dementia, traumatic brain injury, or learning disabilities,\n- non-visible chronic health conditions, including diabetes, chronic pain or fatigue, respiratory conditions or incontinence.\nWhich disabilities are visible?\nAccording to the WHO, persons with disabilities have twice the risk of developing conditions such as depression, asthma, diabetes, stroke or obesity. Some common visible disabilities include:\n- Hearing impairment\n- Visual impairments\n- Cerebral palsy\n- Multiple Sclerosis\n- Down’s Syndrome\n- Tourette Syndrome\nHow you can help employees with non-visible disabilities\nAccording to a 2017 study by the Center for Talent Innovation, among white-collar, college-educated employees around the world, 30% have a disability. However, only 3.2% self-identify as having a disability to their employers. And of all employees with a disability, 62% have a non-visible disability.\nWhat can organisations do to help their workers with a disability? Here are three practical steps you can take.\n- Ensure employees feel comfortable disclosing their disability.\nEmployees with non-visible disabilities will feel more comfortable presenting their authentic selves with their colleagues if they know they work in an inclusive environment. This starts with communicating disability inclusion efforts from top to bottom, across the whole organisation. The 2017 study by the Center for Talent Innovation found that those who disclose their disabilities are more than twice as likely to feel regularly happy or content at work than those who have not disclosed to anyone.\n- Review the accommodations your organisation offers for people with disabilities.\nProviding accommodations for employees with disabilities need not be expensive or difficult. Here are two examples of low-cost accommodations:\n- An employee who struggles with working memory due to a learning disability could receive written instructions for job duties instead of relying on verbal discussion.\n- A person with a chronic condition may need a flexible start time or break time to receive physical therapy or take medication.\n- Offer services and support for people with disabilities.\nCreating or promoting an employee resource group (ERG) that focuses on disability can be a very empowering forum for employees with disabilities and their colleagues who draw alongside them as allies and ambassadors to network and raise issues.\nYour company can offer support for employees with non-visible disabilities in other ways. This can include:\n- Making sure mental health coverage is included in your company insurance plan as seeing out-of-network providers can be costly.\n- Promoting free services that are part of the employee benefit package. An example of this is an Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) that provides individual support and can provide useful information to all employees.\n“An inclusive workplace that supports people with disabilities leads to more than just bottom-line benefits.”\nThe benefits of supporting employees with disabilities — both visible and non-visible — go beyond improving the work lives of these individuals. An inclusive workplace that supports people with disabilities leads to more than just bottom-line benefits. It fosters a culture of openness and creates an environment where all employees can succeed. A 2018 study by Accenture discovered that organisations who adopt best practices for hiring and supporting people with disabilities achieved, on average, 28% higher revenue and double the net income than their peers.\n- Photo by Pawel Czerwinski on Unsplash","Depressive Disorders among the Disabled\nDepressive Disorders among the Disabled\nMany disabled individuals experience some level of depression that need addressing to improve their living standards. Disability in the context can refer to a mental or physical condition that limits a person’s senses, movements and abilities to carry out activities. Depression among this group of people originates from several factors relating to their conditions and problems people face in societies. Individuals can develop different types of depressive disorders that are evident in the duration of types of symptoms. Depressive disorders affect the lives of disabled individuals and can cause adverse impacts on health. Prevention of adverse outcomes requires the treatment of depressive disorders using different approaches depending on the unique needs of each patient.\nIntervention to improve the mental health of disabled patients should begin with evaluation into the causes of depression. Çağan and Ünsal (2014) showed that social isolation and loneliness are some of the leading causes of depression among the population. Disabled individuals face the problems of the inability to move to some areas or carry out some activities that leave them out of the team. Besides, disability makes some of the affected individuals develop the feeling of sadness that leads to depression. Their inability to change their status and how other people view them contribute to the development of depressive disorders. In addition to these factors, other aspects such as loss of loved ones, economic problems, and abuse lead to the development of depressive disorders.\nThe presence of more than one of these factors increases the risk of depression among patients with disabilities. In most cases, disabled individuals face more than an issue that contributes to the development of depressive disorders. Affected individuals develop different types of depressive disorders that need addressing using evidence-based approaches. Analyses highlight different types of depressions affecting the mental health of disabled individuals. The duration of symptoms presented by the patient provides one of the ways that professionals use in classifying depressions.\nTypes of Depressive Disorders\nDisabled individuals are at increased risk of suffering from major depressive disorders due to their condition. Major depressive disorder refers to conditions where the individual present the symptoms for two weeks or extended periods. Information used in health facilities shows that patients should show symptoms such as fatigue, hopelessness, suicidal thoughts and loss of pleasure. Patients may even show remissions of major depressive disorder that significantly affect the health of disabled people (Culpepper, Muskin & Stahl, 2015). Thus, evaluation of the mental health of disabled individuals should consider the possibility of major depressive disorder.\nDisabled individuals may also develop bipolar disorder. Individuals having the condition show extreme fluctuations of moods, behavior, sleep and energy. The depression due to bipolar disorder may lead to suicidal thoughts that can further involve additional changes. Disabled individuals having manic depression show mood swings that can take place more frequently, such as every week or in sporadic nature, such as twice annually. Health professionals should evaluate the incidence of changes in moods of affected people to determine the presence of manic depressions.\nThe impact on the mental health of disabled individuals may also involve the development of dysthymia. The condition refers to a persistent depressive disorder that can last for many years. People who develop dysthymia can show symptoms that affect their relationships, daily activities and work. A constant feeling of sadness among people having dysthymia finds it hard to be happy on any occasion. Affected individuals may show signs of complaining most of the time that affect their relationships with other people in society.\nAssessment aiming to improve the mental health of patients should analyze the type of depressive disorder. The information gained from the client help in the provision of best care using a patient-centered approach. However, there is a need to understand the health impact of depression to facilitate interventions.\nImpact of Depression on Health\nOne of the most noticeable health concerns due to depression is cases of suicides. Disabled individuals who have depression have suicidal thoughts as one of the symptoms. Suicidal thoughts originate from an overbearing sense of sadness with affected individuals seeing no way out. Therefore, such situations present death as one of the options to escape from existing problems. Disabled individuals face many challenges that can prompt the feeling of hopelessness that make some individuals think suicide is the only way out of problems.\nDepression among disabled individuals shows significant impacts on their appetite. Change in appetite is one of the common signs of depression. Some individuals who have depression experience loss of appetite while others increase the amount of food they eat. In any case, changes in appetite result in health problems. Individuals may adopt the habit of taking less food that limits their ability to take nutrients that meet physiological requirements. Cases of nutritional deficiencies can lead to significant health problems depending on the deficient nutrient. Malnutrition also affects the immune system that can lead to infections affecting the health of the patient. Therefore, depressed individuals are at increased risk of malnutrition health problems.\nDepression can cause overeating that results in other sets of health problems. Overeating due to depression increases calories provided to the body. Constant accumulation of calories contributes to weight gain resulting in health problems such as diabetes, obesity and hypertension. The development of these health problems affects disabled and depressed individuals that can lead to fatalities. The gain of weight due to overeating can further lead to low self-esteem that further affects the mental health of the patient.\nThe presence of depression among disabled individuals also increases the risk of heart conditions. Depression causes low energy among disabled people that is evident in their unwillingness to carry out any physical activity. The person develops a sedentary lifestyle that increases the risk of heart problems. Studies also indicate the association between heart disease and depression among affected individuals. Studies show additional factors that increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases due to depression other than sedentary lifestyles. A study by Dhar and Barton published in 2016, showing an association between major depressive disorder (MDD) and coronary heart disease (CHD), highlighted that neurochemicals released due to MDD increase the risk of CHD. Thus, despite the lack of changes in the lifestyles of individuals, depression can still lead to heart problems.\nThe presence of these health problems shows the need for interventions aiming to improve the mental and physical health of patients having depression. In cases of physical health, health professionals should consider the need of every patient. At the same time, the assessment of the patient should involve evaluation of the cause of depression to provide patient-centered services. Therefore, support for disabled people should focus on specific aspects affecting each patient to improve the outcome. Health professionals should use various intervention approaches to improve the health of disabled people having depression.\nInterventions to Manage Depression among Disabled\nTreatment of depression among depressed individuals can involve the use of many approaches depending on the needs of clients. The prescription of medications to manage the mental condition of patients is one of the methods. Professionals can also opt for therapies that focus on the cognition and behavior of the patient to improve mental health. A combination of more than one method is also useful in some cases to further improve outcomes.\nTreatment of depression among affected individuals using medications primarily relies on antidepressant medications. The use of antidepressants aims to manage the symptoms presented by patients. Such drugs achieve the objective by changing neurochemicals in the brain to manage the feelings of individuals. Impacts of the medications restore chemical balance in the brain to relieve depression symptoms. Patients have a range of antidepressants to choose from while aiming to manage their health conditions. The choice of medication depends on symptoms, suspected side effects, possible drug interactions and costs for some patients. Thus, health professionals must consider symptoms presented and patients’ medical history of prescribing appropriate medication. However, the drugs do not provide immediate relief to patients at the beginning of using medication. Patients taking medications require about two to four weeks to start realizing the effects.\nDespite the effectiveness of medication in the ability to relieve symptoms, it is not the preferable approach to treat depression. Impacts of medications only last while patients use medications. Symptoms of depression may be present after patients stop using antidepressants. Medications are ineffective due to their inabilities to address the underlying problems leading to depression. Therefore, professionals prescribe medications together with other treatment methods to improve the outcomes.\nPsychotherapies show high efficacy in treating patients with depressive disorders. They involve evaluating causes of depression as part of addressing the problem. In some cases, professionals may use more than one method to enhance the outcomes. Therapists that use psychotherapies should develop strong relationships with patients to improve outcomes.\nInterpersonal therapy can be crucial to disabled individuals by improving personal relationships with other people (Van Hees, Rotter, Ellermann & Evers, 2013). Disabled people face isolation as one of the factors causing depression. Improving relationships helps in keep people around through interactions to eliminate loneliness and social isolation.\nPsychodynamic therapy focuses on the experience of disabled people to understand the source of depression. Most cases of depression arise from experiences of individuals that affect interactions and lives. Some of the disabled individuals may even show the impacts of experiences unconsciously leading to depression. The use of the approach focuses on such incidents to improve the recovery of patients.\nCognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is an effective method to treat depression (Vara et al., 2018). Psychotherapists applying the approach aim to assess negative thoughts associated with depression and make appropriate changes. Patients gain from the method by developing coping mechanisms to limit remissions.\nDespite the presence of different therapies for depression, effective treatments should involve a combination of different approaches. Professionals can prescribe medications for fast improvement of depression symptoms. However, interventions that ensure there are no remissions of depressive disorders require psychotherapies that focus on the cause of depression. Besides, professionals providing the services should evaluate the need of every client to provide patient-centered services during therapies.\nÇağan, Ö., & Ünsal, A. (2014).

{"question":"What are the pros and cons of fixed blade hunting knives compared to folding blades?","answer":"Fixed blade knives are stronger since they're made as a single piece with no moving parts. They are always open and ready for quick use. However, they take up more space in a pack and can get caught on brush since they remain extended. Folding blade knives, on the other hand, are safer to carry since the blade folds into the handle and they are more compact, easily sliding into a pocket. They have a locking mechanism to prevent accidental folding, but they are not as solid for tough jobs as fixed blade knives.","context":["Besides a gun or bow, a knife is one of the most essential tools of the hunter’s trade. Without it, the game meat would never make it from field to table—and there are a host of other jobs around camp and in the woods that make a knife absolutely essential. But stroll into the sporting goods store to pick out your next blade and you’ll likely be dumbfounded because of an overabundance of choices. There are locking blades or fixed blades, straight or serrated edges and they come in all shapes and sizes.\nThere’s no right answer as to what the perfect knife is—it really depends on what you plan to use it for—but there are some basic considerations to keep in mind the next time you’re in the market for this vital outdoorsman’s tool.\nTo start, hunting knives are divided into three basic styles:\nFixed Blade Knives\nAs the name implies, a fixed blade knife is built as one piece, with the blade always open and exposed, and it is affixed to a sturdy handle. As such it is carried in a sheath to protect you from the blade when it’s not in use. A fixed blade is generally stronger since it’s a single piece with no moving parts to weaken the design. Benefits of the fixed blade, besides its strength, are that they are always open and ready for quick use. Negatives are they are larger and remain extended, which means they can take a little more space in a pack or can get caught up on brush.\n- <h2>Helle Temagami Fixed Blade</h2>The fixed blade knife is the best option for tough jobs that require rigidity and durability. Since the blade and handle are one solid piece of metal, it can take a beating without breaking. <p> An exceptional, all-purpose fixed blade is the <a href=\"http://www.helle.no/products/knives/temagami/\" target=\"_blank\">Helle Temagami</a>, a Norwegian-made knife that is built to handle the toughest conditions. The Temagami, like all Helle knives, is built to work, and is proudly endorsed by the Survivorman himself, Les Stroud. <p> <strong>Price: $180</strong>\nFolding Blade Knives\nThese blades are considered the safest to carry because the blade folds compactly into the handle of the knife. They are also more compact, sliding easily into a pocket or pack. Blades are generally held in place when by a locking mechanism, which prevents them from folding up and cutting the user. As a major benefit, this style of knife is compact and safe. On the other hand, they are not as solid for tough jobs like a fixed blade knife would be.\nBasically the only difference between these knives and folding knives is that clip knives easily fasten to the inside of a pocket or pants for more convenient carrying and access. As a benefit, clip knives are convenient to carry and great for general use. Negatively, the compact design can make them less sturdy and easier to lose because they can be knocked off the edge of your pants or pocket.\nUnderstanding Blade Materials\nThis one can be tricky since there are a lot of different materials for making knife blades, all of them delivering varying degrees of strength or ductility (how well the blade can be battered without shattering), the ability to keep an edge and resistance to corrosion. There are others, but these are the three most important characteristics for most sportsmen. Many modern blade materials are simply alloyed stainless steel of varying degrees, designed to deliver a balance of these three qualities.\nBasic stainless steel resists corrosion and is tough, but it doesn’t hold an edge for long. Carbon steels, on the other hand, tend to keep a great edge. Negatively, it tends to rust with the slightest amount of moisture. To save time on research, stick with one of the modern stainless steels. You won’t have to put much care in your knife and the blade will hold an edge and sharpen easily.\nUnderstanding Blade Shape\nClip point, drop point, tanto point, sheepsfoot, dagger point, trailing point, spear point and gut hook are among more than a dozen blade shapes available. However, for the sportsman, there are four of particular importance.\nDrop Point: A drop point blade boasts a sturdy, thick point for strength. It’s also less prone to puncturing materials, such as hides or vitals when skinning.\nClip Point: A clip point blade has a thinner tip than a drop point and can be used to make initial cuts easier because of the pointier tip. As a downside, it can also break more easily.\nTrailing Point: A trailing point blade falls between the clip point and drop point designs. It is stronger than clip point and has a back edge that trails upward, allowing for a larger curve to the cutting edge for more slicing surface. This is a great blade shape for cutting meat.\nGut Hook: More of a convenience than a necessity, the gut hook has a sharpened notch or “hook” cut into the topside of the blade that makes it easier to open an animal or bird’s abdominal cavity when you need to remove the vitals.\nSerrated vs. Plain Blades\nSerrated blades, with little cuts or teeth in them, have become more popular in recent years and are one more blade consideration a hunter must keep in mind. The traditional straight edged or plain blade allows for better precision and control when cutting. It’s best for push cuts as opposed to slicing cuts, such as cutting apples or potatoes, but I also like them better for precise jobs such as skinning.\nSerrated blades work best with slicing cuts since the blade’s teeth help act like a saw and can cut through tough hide and sinew when cleaning game. Because most cuts used when field dressing and butchering game involves slicing cuts over push cuts, the serrated blades are becoming more popular among sportsmen.\nUnderstanding Handle Ergonomics\nKnife handles are designed to provide comfort and grip to the user, some boasting contours, checkered surfaces or even a broader front near the blade to prevent your hand from slipping toward the cutting surface.\nWhen choosing a knife, find one that fits your hand well and feels good when you grip it. It’s really just a matter of personal preference. The most important thing is you don’t want one that will slip in your hand when using it.\nDoes Blade Size Matter?\nFor most hunters, the ideal blade length should fall between three and six inches. Any longer and the knife can become unwieldy when performing precision cuts—causing cuts where you don’t want them—but any shorter and it can be difficult to maintain a suitable grip and maintain leverage when making cuts.\nThink of the most common jobs you plan to use your knife for and consider these six elements and your own personal preferences to select your next perfect hunting knife."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:734d83f6-17c9-49d3-a679-7140491290d7>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do nitrile dipped gloves and chemical-resistant gloves compare in terms of employer payment requirements and protective capabilities?","answer":"According to regulations, employers must purchase both nitrile dipped gloves and chemical-resistant gloves when required for workplace safety compliance. Nitrile dipped gloves offer protection against punctures, tears, and oils, while providing a snug fit for flexibility and dexterity. Chemical-resistant gloves provide protection against hazardous materials including acids, solvents, and oils. Both types offer durability and versatility, though chemical-resistant gloves specifically focus on preventing exposure to harmful substances that could cause skin irritation or burns.","context":["When providing guidance on the selection and use of PPE, it is critical for occupational safety and health experts to understand not only the technical issues surrounding the use of PPE as an exposure control method, but also the regulatory compliance burden placed on the employer. I recognize that just complying with OSHA standards is not equivalent to meeting industry best practices, but is important to understand the what might be considered the back-bone of PPE programs in the US.\nIn February, OSHA announced the publication of an update of Enforcement Guidance for Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) in General Industry. This update establishes OSHAs general enforcement and guidance policy for its Standards addressing PPE. The PPE Standards had been revised by OSHA in 2007 and 2009. These changes had not been reflected in the former enforcement Instruction.\nThe updated information provided to the OSHA Compliance Officers is helpful for all of us to review. The revised OSHA Enforcement Guidance spotlights the following:\n- Employer-provided (purchased) PPE requirements (Who, What, Which)\n- Clarification of payment requirements for PPE worn off the jobsite, for PPE that must remain at the jobsite, and for employee-owned PPE.\nWho: Employers must provide PPE to all affected employees with an established employer-employee relationship. These employees include short-term employees which may be referred to as temporary employees, piece workers, seasonal employees, hiring hall employees, labor pool employees, or transient employees.\nWhat: Employers must pay for PPE that is required to comply with OSHA Standards, except in the limited cases specified in the Standards. Employers must provide, at no cost to employees, the PPE that is necessary to protect against the hazards that the employer is aware of as a result of any hazard assessments required and specified in the OSHA standards. An employer must provide, at no cost to employees, upgraded PPE that the employer chooses to use to meet OSHA PPE requirements.\nWhich: OSHA is updating the references in its regulations to recognize more recent editions of the applicable national consensus standards, and is deleting editions of the national consensus standards that PPE must meet if purchased before a specified date. In addition, OSHA is amending its provision that requires safety shoes to comply with a specific American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard.\nSo what PPE must employers provide with no cost to their employees? And what PPE are employers not obligated by OSHA to purchase for use by the employees? It can be confusing! The following is a list of examples and exceptions:\n- those highlighted in GREEN are must purchase items\n- those highlighted in red are not required to be purchased by the employer.\nIn most cases, the determining factor for who pays for the PPE is whether the PPE is required to comply with a specific standard. The outcome of site-specific PPE hazard assessments will determine what PPE is required. (Some of the exceptions seemed counter-intuitive to me ... what do you think?)\nPPE that an Employer Must Purchase (when required to comply with a standard)\n- Metatarsal foot protection\n- Chemical resistant boots with steel toes\n- Shoe covers toe caps and metatarsal guards\n- Non-prescription eye protection (safety glasses)\n- Prescription eyewear inserts/lenses for full-facepiece respirators\n- Prescription eyewear inserts/lenses for welding and diving helmets\n- Face shields\n- Laser safety goggles\n- Firefighting PPE (helmet, gloves, boots, proximity suits, full gear)\n- Hard hats\n- Hearing protection\n- Welding PPE\n- Items used in medical/laboratory settings to protect from exposure to infectious agents (aprons, lab coats, goggles, disposable gloves, shoe covers)\n- Non-specialty gloves for protection from dermatitis, severe cuts/abrasions.\n- Payment is not required if they are only for keeping clean or for cold weather (with no safety or health considerations)\n- Chemical-resistant gloves/aprons/sleeves/clothing\n- Encapsulating chemical protective suits\n- Aluminized gloves\n- Rubber insulating gloves\n- Mesh cut-proof gloves, mesh or leather aprons\n- Self Contained Breathing Apparatus, atmosphere-supplying respirators\n- Air-purifying respirators\n- Personal fall protection\n- Ladder safety device belts\n- Climbing ensembles used by linemen (for example, belts and climbing hooks)\n- Window cleaners safety straps\n- Personal Flotation Devices (life jackets)\n- Reflective work vests or clothing\n- Electric arc and flame-resistant garments\nSome exceptions to the employer purchase requirement:\nNon-specialty PPE - if the employer allows the employee to wear it off the job site","Rubber Coated Gloves: The Cutting Edge of Hand Safety\nWhen it comes to hand protection, nitrile dipped or rubber coated gloves will be the go-to selection for many industries.

{"question":"How do aluminum and brass materials compare in terms of corrosion resistance and maintenance needs?","answer":"Aluminum with proper anodizing shows excellent corrosion resistance, with testing showing corrosion rates as low as 2x10-4 mils per year and no visible corrosion even after 14 months of continuous testing. In contrast, brass, being an alloy of copper and zinc, naturally tarnishes when exposed to oxygen and requires regular maintenance. To maintain brass, it needs periodic cleaning with either a baking soda and lemon juice paste or vinegar soak to remove tarnish, followed by wiping with a soft cotton rag after wearing and storage in a plastic bag with an anti-tarnishing strip to slow the tarnishing process.","context":["Corrosion Resitance of Anodized Aluminum for Water-Cooled Electronc Assemblies\nPower converters present unique challenges in electronic packaging and heat management. Their concentration of electrical energy, propensity for electro-magnetic interference generation, integration of heavy, irregularly shaped magnetic components, and requirements for compromised reliability and affordable cost oftentimes requires the use of liquid cooling. Historically, when liquid cooling is utilized copper has been the material of choice for the system's wetted elements. However, given its cost and weight advantages, latest generation systems have been turning to aluminum for wetted elements.\nThanks to the advancements in the electronics industry, high power electronic systems continue to become smaller and more space efficient. While air cooling remains the preferred cooling method for a wide range of application and power levels, liquid cooling has been gaining traction due to the demand for higher power from smaller packages. Typical liquid cooled systems utilize copper or aluminum cold plates as a heat transfer material due to their superior thermal conductivities and wide availability. While copper is considered to be the preferred material for high heat flux applications due to its higher thermal conductivity, aluminum offers significant cost savings and weight reductions for moderate heat flux applications.\nAmong the concerns in liquid cooling for electronics are potential cooling system leaks or cooling effectiveness degradation due to pitting and/or galvanic corrosion.\nPitting corrosion is the erosion of metal at small locations where a hole or a cavity is formed. Pitting erosion in water is affected by many factors; among the most significant are presence of chlorides and pH levels of the water.\nGalvanic erosion occurs when two dissimilar metals are electrically connected in a conductive solution. The greater the separation in the anodic index for the two materials, the greater the galvanic corrosion potential and risk become, where the least noble metal starts corroding preferentially.\nAnodic Index of Common Metals in Salt Water:\nAstrodyne TDI's proprietary LiquaBlade utilizes aluminum alloy 6063-T5 cold plate heat exchangers protected with a sealed anodized finish for resistance to corrosion in a wide variety of applications.\nThese parts are critical to performance, especially in applications where corrosion inhibitors are not used, or there are copper components present in the same cooling system (such as wetted components in a chiller).\nEither of these may promote galvanic corrosion. For this reason, an extensive study was conducted to evaluate pitting and galvanic corrosion resistances of 6063-T5 aluminum with various coatings in fresh water and de-ionized water applications.\nThe investigation s conducted in two phases. In Phase I, an experiment was conducted to visually examine the effects of un-plated or anodized aluminum plates (alloy 6063-T5) when commingled with un-plated copper in tap (fresh) water. For this, a closed circulation loop was designed, as pictured in Figure 2, and surface conditions of samples were monitored over 14 months.\nIn phase II, aluminum plates with three different coatings were sent to a NADCAP approved third party lab to perform pitting and galvanic corrosion testing to quantify corrosion rates both in tap and de-ionized water applications.\nPhase I Testing:\nPhase I testing was intended to provide qualitative evaluation of corrosion resistances of un-plated and anodized aluminum (per MIL-A-8625F8 Type II with Nickel Acetate Sealing) samples by running a long term testing, where samples were installed in closed loop circuits and surface conditions were visually examined periodically for signs of corrosion over the course of 18 months.\nFor this purpose, a closed loop cooling circuit was created. For each type of samples, two aluminum plates were mounted with an un-plated copper bar between them without being in contact. Water in the systems was replenished every 2 weeks.\nEvidence of corrosion on the unprotected surfaces started to emerge within the first couple of days of testing and progressively worsened over time. At the end of week 16, the samples were taken out of the setup and visually inspected. The un-plated sample experience heavy pitting corrosion, where while aluminum oxide formation covered the entire plate. Testing on the un-plated aluminum samples was halted at this point.\nThe anodized aluminum sample after 16 weeks showed no signs of corrosion so it was kept in the circuit for prolonged testing. After 14 months of testing, the anodized sample was taken out of the setup for inspection and no signs of visible corrosion existed.\nPhase II Testing:\nPhase II testing was intended to provide more comprehensive analytical data on the corrosion resistance of various coatings on aluminum allot and 6063-T5 for both tap water and de-ionized water applications. Two separate sets of experiments (for pitting and galvanic erosion) were conducted at a NADCAP approved third party laboratory, to characterize the corrosion resistance of 6063-T5 aluminum allot having three different finishes namely, Type II anodize nickel plating and tin plating according to the following specifications:\n- Anodized per MIL-A-8625F8 Type II with Nickel Acetate Sealing\n- Tin plating per ASTM B545 Class B\n- Nickel Plating per AMS-QQ-N-290B Class I Grade F\nCorrosion potentials and current densities were measured and corrosion rates of samples were calculated\nThe first test was potentiodynamic testing samples in tap water and de-ionized water aimed at quantifying pitting corrosion resistance and corrosion rates. Samples were tested using ASTM G61-86(14) as a reference method. Tests were conducted in a local tap water and de-ionized water with 1ppm sodium phosphate solution added\nSamples were mounted to support rods with conductive tape and the connection masked with a polymeric film. Test solutions were either local tap water (Lansing, New York) or distilled water with 1ppm sodium phosphate. Sodium phosphate was added to the DI water to improve the ionic conductivity, necessary for corrosion cell operation, without influencing the test results. (At levels of approximately 500ppm, sodium phosphate is often used as a corrosion inhibitor for aluminum alloys).\nTests were conducted using ASTM G61 as a guide. Test temperature was 50 degrees Celsius for all tests expect one test of nickel plated aluminum at 3 degrees Celsius. All solutions were continuously bubbled with compressed air at a rate of approximately 150cm3/min.\nCorrosion rates were then calculated using the equations found in ASTM G 102 (Standard Practice for Calculation of Corrosion Rates and Related Information for Electrochemical Measurements). The density for the anodized aluminum was 3.95-g/cm3, for nickel 8.9-g/cm3, and for tin 7.3-g/cm3. The equivalent weights were 8.5, 29.36, and 59.34, respectively.\nTest results show no samples exhibited corrosion; that is, all coatings withstood the test conditions without breaking down and allowing rapid local corrosion. All samples exhibited very low equilibrium corrosion rates far below 1mpy (mile per year). All samples exhibited faster corrosion in near-distilled water with 1 ppm sodium phosphate compared to tap water.\nAnodized aluminum samples exhibited the lowest corrosion rates of approximately 2x10-4 mpy, while the tin plated samples had the highest corrosion rates of 0.05-0.09 mpy. Note, at a plating thickness of 0.1mil, minimum, the anodized aluminum heat exchanges used in LiquaBladeTM project a useful life of over 100 years before pitting corrosion would begin to degrade the underlying aluminum material.\nGalvanic corrosion testing of aluminum samples with un-plated C11000 copper in tap water was also conducted. For this purpose, samples were lightly polished with 600 grit SiC prior to testing. Samples were then mounted on a steel rod using electrically conductive tape. (Note, the presence of the steel rod connecting the samples provides an enhanced pat for galvanic corrosion to occur and thus represents a highly conservative test method).\nTesting was performed using the guidance of ASTM G71 (Standard Guide for Conducting and Evaluating Galvanic Corrosion Tests in Electrolytes). The potential was monitored using a saturated calomel electrode (SCE) as the reference electrode. For this test, the aluminum sample acts as the anode and the copper sample acts as the cathode. Testing was conducted for 168 hours at 50oC using local tap water aerated at rate of approximately 150-cm3/min. Exposed area for each sample was approximately 4 cm2 with a cathode to anode area ratio of 1 +/- 0.05.\nTest results showing the corrosion potentials and current densities as a function of time are shown in the following figures, for anodized, nickel plated and tin plated samples, respectively. The data from the final day of exposure were used to calculate the long term average current density and the corrosion rates using the same equations found in ASTM G102 Standard.\nThe results indicate anodized aluminum exhibited the best corrosion resistance with >0.01 mpy corrosion rate, while tin plated aluminum had 0.17 mpy and nickel plated aluminum had the highest corrosion rate at 3.0 mpy.\nNote at a plating thickness of 0.1mil, minimum, the anodized aluminum heat exchanges used in LiquaBladeTM, taking into account the highly conservative nature of this test, project a useful life of well over 10 years before galvanic corrosion would begin to degrade the underlying aluminum material.\nA two phase investigation on corrosion resistance of aluminum allot 6063-T5 in water cooled packaging applications was carried out. The first phase of the investigation, a qualitative evaluation of corrosion development on un-plated and anodized aluminum samples was performed. Results revealed that corrosion develops rapidly on un-plated aluminum surfaces and oxide later forms within days. After only 16 weeks of testing, the sample exhibited signs of severe pitting corrosion. In contrast, an anodized aluminum sample showed no signs of corrosion sites even after 14 months of continuous testing.\nTo further the investigation, a more comprehensive analysis was conducted to evaluate the corrosion resistance of anodized, nickel plated and tin plated aluminum in tap and de-ionized water, as well as with copper in the system as the dissimilar material. With this study, both pitting and galvanic corrosion rates were quantified.\nNone of the samples showed any signs of pitting corrosion, where anodized aluminum exhibited the lowest corrosion rates among all in every condition (corrosion rates being smaller than 2.10-4 mils per year for pitting corrosion and 0.01 mils per year for galvanic corrosion with the presence of copper).\nThe anodized aluminum heat exchangers used in Astrodyne TDI's LiquaBladeTM product project well over 10 years useful life when utilized in cooling systems that also feature copper wetted components.","How do I clean and care for my sterling silver jewelry?\nAvoid exposing your sterling silver jewelry to harsh chemicals such as chlorine, cosmetics, hair spray, and perfume.\nTo avoid tarnishing, periodically wash with mild soap, not detergent, and water. Dry thoroughly before storing.\nHow do I clean and care for my stainless steel jewelry?\nStainless steel is an alloy of iron and chromium and does not tarnish and will not rust. However, over time it may lose its luster. To restore the shine to your stainless steel you can follow the cleaning instructions for brass and bronze.\nChlorine can pit stainless steel, so avoid exposing your stainless steel piece to chlorinated products such as chlorine bleach and chlorinated swimming pools. If your piece does come in to contact with chlorinated products, rinse throughly and dry it off as soon as possible.\nHow do I clean and care for my bronze jewelry?\nBronze is an alloy of copper and, usually, tin. Like brass, bronze will natually tarnish over time. Follow the cleaning and prevention instructions of brass.\nHow do I clean and care for my brass jewelry?\nBrass is an alloy of copper and zinc and will naturally tarnish when exposed to oxygen. Some people like the patina of tarnished brass and the tarnish is actually a protective layer for the brass, but if you want to get the shine of the new brass it's pretty easy to do with some typical household products.\nIf the tarnish isn't too pervasive take about 2 tablespoons of baking soda and add drops of lemon juice - from concentrate is fine - until you have a nice paste. The lemon juice will bubble and fizz as you add, don't worry it'll stop after a second or two. Take an old toothbrush and apply the paste to your piece and scrub. Let it sit in the paste for about 30 minutes and then rinse it with water and dry it thoroughly.\nIf the piece is heavily tarnished or the above doesn't work, you can place the piece in vinegar and let it soak for 30-60 minutes and then scrub it with an old toothbrush. Once clean, rinse it with water. This cleaning method is more aggressive and may leave the piece more \"raw\" looking - it won't have as warm of color until the patina rebuilds.\nOils from your skin and the oxygen in the air are what accelerate tarnishing. If you want to slow the tarnish process, wipe the piece with a soft cotton rag after wearing and store in a plastic bag with an anti-tarnishing strip. You should have received one of these with your piece.\nHow do I clean and care for my aluminum, niobium, and titanium jewelry?\nKeep your aluminum, niobium, and titanium jewelry away from corrosive chemicals like chlorine, bleach, acids, and drain cleaning solutions to prevent your jewelry from oxidizing and losing luster.\nTo clean wash with a gentle dish soap, like Dawn (not a harsh detergent), and water, then pat dry with a clean cloth. Also, it is recommended you wipe down the jewelry after wearing it with a clean cloth and store in a plastic bag when not in use.\nInformation about the different materials we use\nWhat is the difference between solid gold and gold plated?\nSolid gold rings are just that, rings made completely out of gold. However, solid gold is very soft and very expensive.\nGold plated is a process of coating a base metal with gold. This coating is very thin and protect the jewelry for a long period of time.\nWhat is the difference between plating, anodizing and enameling?\nEnameling is the coating of a metal with a non-metallic substance - plastic in the case of enameled copper.\nPlating is a thin coating of a metal on another metallic substance - such as silver plated copper.\nAnodizing changes the surface of a metal through an electrochemical process without changing the composition of the metal.\nWhat is bronze?\nBronze is an alloy of copper (90% or more copper) and tin. Bronze has a redder color than brass and is harder and more durable than copper. Because of the copper, bronze will tarnish over time but can be cleaned to restore its original finish.\nWhat is brass?\nBrass is an alloy of copper and zinc. There are two main types of brass - yellow brass and red brass (also called jeweler's brass. Brass will tarnish over time but can be cleaned to restore its shine and color.\nWhat is stainless steel?\nStainless steel is a steel alloy that does not rust or corrode and is compose primarily of iron with 18-20% chromium and 8-10% nickel. Stainless steel is shiny but with a slightly darker hue than aluminum or silver that will darken over time. Because stainless steel contains nickel, those with nickel allergies usually cannot wear stainless steel.\nWhat is the difference between copper and enameled copper?\nThe copper rings we use are 99.9% copper. Copper will tarnish over time turning a reddish brown and eventually green if left unchecked. Enameled copper is copper that has been coated in a colored plastic and also prevents tarnishing. However, because enameling is a plastic coating of the wire, this coating can be scratched if care is not taken.\nWhat is .925 sterling silver?\n.925 Sterling silver is a silver alloy of 92.5% silver and 7.5% copper. The copper makes the silver harder and more durable but also causes the silver to tarnish over time. Ivonne’s works almost exclusively with sterling silver for silver pieces.\nWhat is Rhodium plated?\nRhodium is an extremely rare and valuable metal. The Rhodium Plate that is added to rings is much thinner than the width of a human hair. Rhodium plate on jewelry pieces can be anywhere from around 0.10 to 1.70 microns. (An average human hair is 100 microns thick). Rhodium does increase the durability of the metal it is plated over, but rhodium can only offer so much protection against scratches and dents.\nA few other special care considerations for rhodium plated that can help:\nRemove jewelry before performing any activities that could expose it to scratches or dents.\nAvoid getting the jewelry wet.\nTake the jewelry off when washing your hands or during your bath\nAvoid exposing the jewelry to chemicals and to cosmetic products including hairspray, lotions and soaps.\nWhat types of metal can you use?\nMost of our jewelry is made with either brass, stainless steel, sterling silver; rhodium plated, gold plated, aluminum, copper and bronze.
