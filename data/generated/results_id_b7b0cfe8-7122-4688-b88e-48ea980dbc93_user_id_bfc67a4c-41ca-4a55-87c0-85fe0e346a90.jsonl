{"question":"Compare CE and cuneiform - how old are they and what are they used for?","answer":"CE (Common Era) and cuneiform represent different aspects of tracking time and communication. CE is a modern calendar notation that emerged in the early 1700s as an alternative to AD, and is used for dating years after the birth of Jesus Christ. Cuneiform, on the other hand, is an ancient writing system invented by the Sumerians around 5000 years ago. It was created using wedge-shaped marks on clay tablets and was primarily used for taxation transactions before developing into a complete writing system for conveying both concrete and abstract information.","context":["Difference between AD and BC:\nWhile considering dates and calendars, many of us have heard about the common abbreviations such as AD, BC, CE and BCE. But have you ever wondered what these frequently used abbreviations actually mean and where are these used? Well if not, then here is your complete guide, and in this article, you will further read about the difference between AD, BC, BCE and CE.\nThe Georgian Calendar is extensively used as a global standard for the measurement of dates. This calendar is used throughout the world and even goes beyond the religious, cultural and linguistic frontiers. Georgian Calendar is based on the supposed birth dates of Jesus Christ. And following years counted from the birth of Jesus Christ are termed as either AD or BC.\nSo, after knowing much about the emergence of these abbreviations, we will talk about what actually AD and BC mean and the difference between the two.\nDifference between AD and BC?\nStandardized under the Julian and Georgian calendar, AD stands for Anno Domini which is a Latin term for “Year of our Lord” and is used as a label for measuring the years after Jesus Christ was born, while on the other hand, BC stands for measuring the years Before Christ.\nAD (Anno Domini) denotes the calendar era after the birth of Jesus Christ and traditionally, the year accepted for Christ’s birth is labelled as AD1 and a year before it is labelled as 1 BC. However, the actual invention of this type of calendaring system was devised in AD 525 but became popular only after AD 800. A fill-in for AD is CE, which means Common Era, Christian Era or the Current Era.\nBC (Before Christ) means the number of years before the time of Jesus Christ. It is believed that BC originated with Bede in the 8th century (AD). The Latin term used for it is “ ante vero incarnationis dominicae tempus” and it actually means “ the time before the Lord’s true incarnation,” identical to the English term “before Christ” and was used by Dionysius Exiguus.\nDifference between CE and BCE?\nCE and BCE are the abbreviations that have a shorter history as compared to AD and BC. Dating from at least the early 1700s, CE stands for “Common or Current Era” (as mentioned above), while BCE stands for “Before the Common (or Current Era).” These abbreviations have been persistently used by Jewish academics for more than 100 years but became much popular in the later fragment of the 20th Century. The CE and BCE are religiously neutral and this is one of the reasons that CE and BCE have replaced BC/ AD in a number of fields, particularly in science and academics.\nDifference between AD and CE?\nWhile as discussed in the article above, CE is used as an alternative for AD. But the actual difference between AD and CE is that while taking into account the usage, AD precedes the date, while CE follows the date, whereas both BC and BCE follow the date. So, as an example, AD 1492 but 1492 CE, and 1500 BC or 1500 BCE.","What civilization was responsible for the development of writing?\nThe beginning of writing has its inception in \"hash marks\" used for counting by people living 50,000 years Before Christ (B.C.). These marks slowly took on more complexity. By 4,000 B.C. the marks had gotten very complex and were used to convey detailed bits of information. In the Indus Valley, some peoples were using such marks to decorate pottery but the marks didn't convey enough cohesive information to be qualified as writing. Writing is defined as an organized and consistent system of graphemes that conveys both concrete and abstract information [grapheme: the minimal unit of a writing system (a, b, c, etc)]. The first to develop such a system were the Sumerians who developed an organized system of graphemes to use in taxation transactions to keep information organized in such a way that all participants in a taxation transaction knew the same things and could agree to the same actions and outcomes. From this beginning, the whole Sumerian writing system developed that later met the definition of an organized system of graphemes for conveying both concrete and abstract information.\n[For more detail, see the article \"The Invention of Writing\" at Erasmatazz.com from which this answer is drawn.]\nI agree with all of the previous answers that state the oldest form of writng (cuniform) is attributed to the ancient Sumerians of Mesopotamia 3200 B.C.E. However, recent archaeological discoveries in Egypt by Gunter Dreyer, German Archaeological Institute in Cario might tell a different story. The small tags he found in the tomb of King Scorpion I date from 3400-3200 B.C.E. suggesting that there might be a two hundred year window that could possibly change the answer to your question, which is why your question is so important to human history. It is vital that those who study our human origins through historical method continue to measure their evidence with that of the archaeological evidence. The quest to understand and correctly document the human experience is ever changing, therefore new information/evidence that has academic merit should always be acknowledged.\nWe do not know this for sure, because some culture might have been writing on wood or papyrus or something and its writings could have been lost because they rotted. However, the first writing we know of was invented by the Sumerian culture of Mesopotamia. This writing was done with a stylus on wet clay. It is known as cuneiform. The word \"cuneiform\" means \"wedge-shaped.\" This term is used because that is what shape the characters generally were.\nThis type of writing was being used as long as five thousand years before the present time.\nWriting has developed with as a series of innovations and and improvement, that took place over a period of around 20,000 years, in ways of representing information in form of pictures and symbols made on plain surfaces. Perhaps, thousands of people from different parts of the world have contributed such development, in prehistoric and ancient era. There are no historical evidence available to to identify any one person or even a small group of person as inventors of writing.\nThe origin of writing can be seen in drawings made on walls of caves, more than 20.000 years back to describe some events. Writing of this type conveyed meaning without depending on knowledge of any particular language. Many scholars believe that writings that depended use of symbols defined by a system of language were first developed by Sumerians around 3500 B.C. This system of writing called cuneiform was very complex with use many symbols that represented words and syllables. Earliest system of writing using a system of alphabets is believed to have been developed by Semites around 1500 B.C.\nIn many ancient communities, writing had an important role, especially since the writing system was known only to certain people. They were considered privileged and keepers of the gift of the gods. Egyptians, Mayans, Chinese, everyone saw writing as a gift from God. Thus, the invention of writing was attributed, by the ancient Egyptian,to the god named Thoth, who had given them the arts and sciences,for the Sumerians, writing was a gift given by the god Enlil, while for the Mayans, shaman and Itzamna wizard were creators of the world and writing.So who knew the secret of the gods was privileged, and sometimes, in this respect, was superior even to leaders.\nThe modern world has decided: writing weren't given to us by the gods, but it was invented by humans, and its invention was made independently, in places like China, Mesopotamia and Mesoamerica. Recently Europe entered in books, struggling for recognition as the place where writing was invented long ago.\nAt first, people scratched on the walls of caves, but in time turned to other media that can be transported. Thus, occured the notes on clay tablets, on the bone or tortoiseshell.\nThe ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia,are fighting for a podium place on the older writing systems. The oldest examples of writing from Mesopotamia is dating from IV millennium BC, but apparently cuneata records on various media have been made much earlier: the adhesive tablets were used by communities in Mesopotamia since 8000 BC.\nThe tablets used were simple (revealed in today's Turkey, Syria, Israel and Jordan), but others, were more complicated, where writing was decorated with all kinds of signs.These small plates, in their evolved from, occurred only in IV millennium BC. AD and it seems that they were used to record trade. Tablets were stored either in \"envelopes\" made from clay, or they were connected with thick twine.\nAnd the Chinese have proved to be inventive, but one thing should be noted: the Chinese system of writing was registering little changes in 3500 years of evolution.The oldest forms of Chinese writing were found on the frog shell and animal bones, being dated between 1500-1000 BC. Their features? Pictographic symbols, that are stylized representations of the objects that they represent. Later, the Chinese have placed their notes on bronze vessels and some of the oldest forms of writing are used today when it comes to art of calligraphy.\nFor the V-VI centuries BC, the Chinese have started to harmonize the system of writing and to remove variations in different regions, so outlined then writing has been preserved until today , only in the twentieth century it was less simplified.\nComplex proved to be the system of Egyptian writing,so hieroglyphics scratched were known only to few people: the scribes or members of religious orders.Therefore, often, even all Pharaohs were not aware of the writing system. So, in addition to hieroglyphics, the Egyptians developed simpler writing systems : hieratic, used by priests, and Demotic, used by ordinary people.Among the oldest inscriptions in hieroglyphs are those known as Narmer and dated to around 3200 BC.\nThe Latin alphabet is the most widely used system of writing and is dated around 700 BC."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8a13119e-6af5-4827-8564-018b5f55d4b0>","<urn:uuid:922f9ad6-a9dd-43f7-9e21-4b138a43bfb9>"],"error":null}
{"question":"¿Cómo ayudó la comunidad del Templo Emanuel a una refugiada LGBTIQ de Uganda? ¡Me interesa mucho conocer ejemplos concretos de solidaridad! 🙏","answer":"The Temple Emanuel community helped the Ugandan LGBTIQ refugee Qwin Mbabazi in multiple ways: A pro bono legal team from Mintz, Levin prepared her asylum case. Seven families offered to house her. Community members provided her with a phone, free medical care from doctors, free counseling from mental health professionals, help finding a job, transportation assistance, and financial resources to help her get established. This overwhelming community response came immediately after Rabbi Gardenswartz and Rav Hazzan Berger sent an email asking for help.","context":["Friday evening’s “Shabbat Alive!” service proceeds as it has every week since its inception in 2007.

Rabbi Wes Gardenswartz and Rav Hazzan Aliza Berger arrived at the Suffolk County Jail to offer prayers and pastoral support to immigrant detainees. They moved through security and rode the elevator to the visitor’s room.\nThey were introduced to Qwin Mbabazi, who sat down and began to share her story. She grew up in Uganda. She was persecuted as a child because she was born left-handed in a culture where left-hand dominance is considered the work of the Devil. She was persecuted as a teen and as a young adult because she was born gay in a country where being gay was legally a death sentence until 2013. Uganda remains one of the most dangerous places in the world to be LGBTIQ. And despite this persecution, Qwin had a clear sense of self and a clear sense of purpose from an early age. In 2010, she became an activist, speaking up at rallies and protests, working to promote feminism, human dignity, and equality. She was an important part of Uganda’s courageous LGBTIQ movement. She helped to organize Ugandan Pride gatherings, served and volunteered in different capacities in the Sexual and Gender minority movement, offered consultancy services on both individual and organizational levels to boost the capacity of the LGBTIQ movement, and was even brave enough to be featured in a magazine article where she publicly claimed her LGBTIQ identity and affirmed that everyone deserves to be able to love and be loved for who they are. For these reasons, she was persecuted, and fled for her very life, seeking asylum in Boston.\nAfter that first visit, Rabbi Gardenswartz and Rav Hazzan Berger visited often. They would talk with Qwin about her life back in Uganda, about her dreams for the future, about her hopes for the LGBTIQ community in Uganda and in Africa. Every visit was intensely emotional. Every visit was hard. Qwin had narrowly escaped her home with her life, but she was now living out her days incarcerated. She could not call her wife; she could not call her mother. Every night, she would lie awake listening to other immigrant detainees sob themselves to sleep or wake up screaming from nightmares. Every day she worried. What if she were deported? What if she had made the wrong choice? What if Boston was also homophobic and dangerous? How would she survive without a source of income? Without a job?\nAnd while Qwin anxiously counted the days inside the jail, the community of Temple Emanuel rallied around her cause. Rabbi Gardenswartz and Rav Hazzan Berger sent an email to the community asking for help. Instantly, people responded.\nA pro bono team of lawyers from Mintz, Levin stepped forward. They knew that her immigration judge would determine the course of her life. If her request for asylum was granted, they knew she could build a life here in Boston as a free woman. But if her request was denied, they knew that she would be deported back to Uganda to face unspeakable punishment and persecution. This team of lawyers worked countless hours to prepare her case, gather evidence, and represent her on her day of judgement.\nCommunity members stepped forward to house her. They knew that if she were granted asylum she would have nowhere to go. Some said she could live with us for a year. Others said she could live with us indefinitely. Within 24 hours, seven families had offered to open their homes to a total stranger.\nShe had no phone; no way to communicate with her family back home. Someone took her to get a phone and put it on their account indefinitely.\nShe had no health insurance. Doctors offered to treat her for free until she could support herself and get health insurance.\nShe had endured trauma, loss, dislocation. Mental health professionals offered to counsel her for free.\nShe had no job. People offered to help her find a job.\nShe had no car. People offered to drive her around.\nShe had no money. People offered to give her resources to get her on her feet.\nAll for a total stranger.\n“The immediacy of the response, the intensity of the response, made me think about a prayer we say in the Amidah, that God frees captives, matir asurim,” Rabbi Gardenswartz said. “Because it is in the Amidah, we say that God frees captives three times a day, every morning, noon and evening. On Shabbat, counting musaf, we say it four times. It is a recurring motif of our daily and Shabbat prayer. Matir asurim. God frees captives. God frees captives. God frees captives. Every day. Forever. We say it. What does it mean? I think it means that when we free those unjustly imprisoned, we are doing God’s work. In a deep sense, our community’s instant and overwhelming generosity channels this core Jewish value.”\nThe day of her immigration hearing arrived and there was a miracle. After 31 years of abuse, discrimination, and struggle in Uganda, after watching LGBTIQ friends killed and maimed by homophobic mobs, after harrowing escapes to Nigeria and then to Boston, after 112 days in jail, there was a miracle in June of 2018. Qwin Mbabazi Fiona was granted political asylum.\nQwin was released from the Suffolk County House of Corrections on June 6, 2018. Within 24 hours, she was back in touch with LGBTIQ activists in Uganda and Africa. On that Saturday, she marched proudly in Boston’s Pride festival. It was the first time in her life that Qwin saw LGBTIQ people marching proudly through the streets without fear. Seeing police officers protecting LGBTIQ people brought her to tears. And she knew that she would spend her life working to bring that blessing to her people in Uganda.\nToday, Qwin works as GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders’ community engagement manager. She travels around the country, promoting human rights and teaching about her own experiences and the importance of supporting and protecting the LGBTIQ community. Qwin has dedicated her life to GLAD’s mission: to create a just society free of discrimination based on gender identity and expression, HIV status, and sexual orientation through strategic litigation, public policy advocacy, and education.\nOutside of her professional activism, Qwin has also become invested in the organizations and communities that supported her on her journey. She has deep friendships with the volunteers who helped her build her life here. She has spoken at various local schools, to tell children about what life can be like in other places and to inspire them to make the world a better place. She has spoken at immigration rallies and volunteered to promote immigrant rights. And she continues to invest her time and energy into supporting her LGBTIQ activist friends who are still fighting for basic human rights and protections in Uganda and in Africa.\nWhen Qwin is not working as a fierce activist or volunteering her time for an important cause, she loves reading crime and detective books and watching horror movies. And, on the Friday nights when she is not travelling, she loves coming back to her Temple Emanuel community for Shabbat Alive!

Thirty-five rabbis were among the crowd, and 45 synagogues were acknowledged for their work in inclusion and mental health awareness.\nRSIP began four years ago with three synagogues representing Judaism’s Orthodox, Conservative and Reform denominations. They were Congregation Shaarei Tefillah of Newton, Temple Beth Elohim of Wellesley and Temple Emunah of Lexington, recalled Sharon Shapiro, a trustee of the Ruderman Family Foundation. Shapiro, who focuses on mental health awareness for the foundation, said in a recent interview with JewishBoston at her office in Newton: “I’m passionate about the subject. With statistics being as high as they are regarding mental health issues, it makes sense that it’s something that needs to be addressed. We started to learn the landscape of mental health last year. We’ve noticed through this project and other partnerships that mental health is coming to the surface, making it a natural topic for the synagogue inclusion project.”\nMolly Silver, manager of RSIP for CJP, praised the Ruderman Family Foundation for “bringing inclusion to the forefront of the Boston Jewish community.” Silver added that local synagogues have been key partners with the foundation “in fostering this work. They make this subject a priority in their communities and do everything they can to make everyone feel welcomed into Jewish life. This is what it means to be holy, inclusive and welcoming to all. This is what it means to be a sacred community.”\nBoth Silver and Shapiro noted RSIP’s remarkable growth over the past three years, which now includes an alumni group. During the course of the evening, there were workshops for seasoned partners, as well as those new to RSIP. Alumni and others could attend facilitated talks on “Moving Your Inclusion Agenda Forward” with representatives from three synagogues that included Congregation Shaarei Tefillah, Temple Beth Elohim and Temple Isaiah of Lexington. There was an option to explore “Disability Awareness” in an interactive session with staff from Gateways: Access to Jewish Education. More recent partners had the opportunity to become better acquainted with the goals of the project in a session on “Strategies for Synagogue Inclusion.”\nFor You Too Were a Stranger: Becoming an Ally to LGBTQ Community,\nIn the News\nAugust 5, 2017\nRemarks from Shabbat Nachamu\nTemple Emanuel – August 5, 2017\nby Daniel Bahner\nGood Shabbos everyone!

{"question":"How did vocalists influence Derek Trucks' slide guitar playing style?","answer":"Derek Trucks developed his phrasing by listening extensively to vocalists like Howlin' Wolf and Aretha Franklin. He was also influenced by the sacred steel school, particularly Aubrey Ghent. This approach was reinforced when he took classes with Ali Akbar Khan, who required all instrumental students to take vocal lessons before working on their instruments. This vocal influence helps him tell a story through his playing and effectively control his phrasing.","context":["The 31-year-old slide guitar fire breather is busy. Plenty busy. But Derek Trucks also is excited that for the rest of this year his priority will be the new group he co-leads with Susan Tedeschi, a Grammy-nominated vocalist and guitar player whose voice embodies the best qualities of classic soul, and who also happens to be his wife.\nThey’ve toured together before, leading the summer festival-hopping Soul Stew Revival, but, like all of Trucks’ bands, that was primarily a touring aggregation. As the Gibson SG die-hard explains it, the group he and Tedeschi assembled to work on the new album, Revelator, earlier this year is the first outfit he’s really drafted from scratch, finding the best musicians to create the sounds he and Susan had in mind for the studio and for the road.\nThe result is a sprawling but organic unit that has the same rootsy depth and improvisatory consciousness as Delaney and Bonnie and Friends and Blind Faith, two groups that prominently featured Gibson Les Paul Sunburst and ES-335 legend Eric Clapton, with whom Trucks has toured as guitar foil. And on Revelator, the Tedeschi Trucks Band effortlessly hop genres. New Orleans funk, hard-core soul, R&B, blues, gospel, jazz and rock all rub elbows on the disc, and live they take flight with improvisational extensions.\nWe recently caught up with Trucks, who discussed the new band, the new album and his amazing slide tone.\nWhy did you and Susan decide to formalize the musical partnership you forged in the Soul Stew Revival with the new band?\nYou want to be surrounded with people who are the best at what they do, and you’re really fortunate when you can find eight or 10 of them. And when it comes to singing deep, Susan is one of the best. When she digs into a gospel bag she can channel Mahalia Jackson, and for me, that kind of singing – very spiritual – sparks things in my playing. It also makes me remember some of the soul and blues influences that I’d moved away from.\nThere’s sarod on “These Walls,” which is a reminder of how deeply Eastern-influenced your first Derek Trucks Band discs were. And there’s stone gospel, rock and blues. How did that mix come about?\nI think I’m more patient now as a musician and as a person. I’m more comfortable returning to things I’ve explored before and stretching out toward the new at the same time. But instead of trying to push out in all kinds of directions at once, I’m happy to let things evolve naturally. That’s part of playing with a group this large. The ensemble sound is going to have to grow into its own on stage.\nWe have a “five minute rule” on stage where we can only improvise during that time – no songs. And those periods are starting to sound like compositions. At times it really starts to be like a freight train, where everybody’s locked and it’s really moving. But I’ll know our sound has really gelled when the subtleties are in place.\nI also think that getting to a deeper place in the music has gotten easier and easier for me. And taking a long time to explore different sounds and styles in the studio while making this album also helped me to tune out distractions.\nWhat I really enjoyed about the process of making this record was I never felt like I was pushing against the grain. It all felt really right. When you get everything flowing in the right direction, your focus just gets wider and wider and you’re really in the moment.\nWhat kind of evolution does Revelator represent for you?\nI think I’ve really evolved as a record maker. Having my own studio in my home has really let me relax and experiment. When we made the last album there and did the project with Herbie Hancock [recording the song “Space Captain”], we were still putting up walls as we recorded. Now we’ve really developed an understanding of how everything sounds and works.\nHaving the studio really allowed us to remove time as a factor. We could pretend it was 1970 again and really spend time working on the album. Today there are no album budgets unless you’re one of the top 10 grossing acts in the world. But we were really able to dig in and really live together and make music, like The Band did when they lived in Big Pink and recorded in Woodstock.\nWhy call the album Revelator?\nI like the intensity of that word. It’s strong, powerful. As a musician, it sets a bar and says the music you’re working on deserves to be reckoned with instead of glossed over. In our culture today so many things are glossed over. Music is a tool to tap back into what we’re supposed to be doing here.\nThe sound of the album and the band is very warm and organic. How did you achieve that?\nMixing down to tape after you record is just a nice thing. Everything is recorded digitally now, but mixing down to tape really glues everything together. It really warms up the midrange. It recreates the sound of the glory days of the late 1960s.\nDid you have reference points from that era when you and Susan were assembling the band?\nWe were thinking about a real warm, natural ensemble sound. Delaney and Bonnie and Blind Faith were live ensembles that were really well integrated. And Sly & the Family Stone, Derek and the Dominos, Joe Cocker’s Mad Dogs & Englishmen band. They were archetypes of what we were thinking about.\nWhen I first saw everybody get on the two busses it takes to carry all the musicians on tour, I said, “What the hell am I thinking?” But then it sounds so good when everybody hits the stage I realize it’s got to be done. It’s too powerful and too right not to do it. And besides the 11 people in the band, there’s the crew – so it’s a lot to wrap my head around. But I need that edge to push me to be as creative and work as hard as I can, so there it is.\nWe also worked together live in the studio as a unit fleshing out the songs, so there’s something beautiful about just making it work and not worrying about editing yourself before getting things together. I think this is the best music I’ve ever made in my life.\nHow easy is it for the band to improvise, given its size?\nWe’ve only done seven or eight shows, so it’s still coming together on stage. One of the biggest challenges is making sure the music has diversity and balance. But because of the group chemistry, that comes naturally. Oteil and Kofi Burbridge are brothers, so they have an amazing kind of communication going. The horn section are friends and have worked together before, so they’re really tight. In the band there’s basically five different subgroups that all know and have played with each other before, so that helps everybody work as a larger unit.\nYou get an extremely well-defined slide tone out of your red Custom Shop SG, similar to Duane Allman. How do you achieve that?\nOn the guitar, it’s almost all neck pickup, and I keep the tone at 6ish, 7ish, 8ish… depending on the song. Live, the set-up is usually just a vintage Super Reverb on 7 or 8, so it’s wide open and I control it with the volume on the guitar. In the studio we experimented quite a bit with the tone. There are a lot of different amps combined. We used a Deluxe quite a bit, a little Princeton quite a bit, an Old Magnatone occasionally, and others. It stays pretty simple – just plugging into an amp or amps and letting it rip. In the studio, we kept the volume of the amps pretty quiet and let the room do the work. I noticed that in the studio the less you blow it out volume wise, the more an amp speaks. Learning that was part of my maturing process.\nAnother thing that’s impressive about your slide playing is your diction: the clarity and form of your phrasing. How do you achieve that very urgent, clear sound?\nMost of that comes from my right hand. I tend to hit hard with my right hand and keep all of my right hand on the strings, like clawing them. You release what you want to release.\nA lot of my phrasing comes from vocalists. For a long time, when I was working on my slide playing, that’s all I listened to – from Howlin’ Wolf to Aretha Franklin. I also take a lot from the sacred steel school, especially Aubrey Ghent. I was already going down that road when I sat in on some classes with Ali Akbar Khan, the Hindustani classical slide player. He made all his instrumental students take vocal lessons before they could work on their instruments.\nUltimately, you need to tell your story. With every sound you make, you need to say something. And knowing when to start and stop a phrase is as important as all the stuff you practice for days. The only limitations with slide are in the way you hear it.\nSusan’s also an excellent guitarist. What was her instrumental role on Revelator?\nSusan plays rhythm on most of the record and takes the lead on “Love Has Something Else to Say,” which was just her plugged into an amp playing live as we cut the basic tracks. She just blew through it.\nMagic Sam and Johnny “Guitar” Watson are her two biggest guitar influences. When we play with the Allman Brothers, a lot of different guitar players come and sit in. She can get up with anybody and just cut through the [expletive].\nIs open E still your primary tuning?\nYes, but on a few tunes on Revelator I used an old Firebird and tuned it down to open D. We wrote 30 songs for the album and trimmed them down to 11, so there was plenty of time to experiment.\nYou’re cast as the inheritor of Duane Allman’s style, because of both your playing - Duane was a major influence on you – and your family heritage. What are your thoughts about Duane and his legacy?\nDuane is a seminal figure like Charlie Christian or Wes Montgomery – a guy who came along at exactly the point where there was a major change in music, and fell into the center of it.\nFor electric slide you’ve gotta go back to Elmore James, and Duane was really that next step.

{"question":"Please explain to me what is main headquarters location of CEC and OAS organizations?","answer":"The OAS has its headquarters in Washington, D.C., United States. The CEC is headquartered in Montreal, Canada, as evidenced by the location where they announced their new Executive Director.","context":["Richard A. Morgan announced as new Executive Director of the North American Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC)\nMontreal, 5 July 2019—The Council of the Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC) today announced the appointment of Richard A. Morgan as the ninth Executive Director of the CEC Secretariat.\nRichard A. Morgan is a former Commissioner for the International Joint Commission (IJC). During his time at the helm of the Canadian section of the IJC, he was responsible for overseeing projects that affect the level and flow of water across the Canada-US border and investigations of transboundary issues. He has over 30 years’ experience in public affairs, business and government administration in both the public and private sector.\nBorn in Sherbrooke, Quebec, and raised in Montreal, Richard A. Morgan brings to the CEC a breadth and depth of experience in public policy, international relations and change management. He began his career in the political arena as the executive assistant to the Prime Minister of Canada immediately after graduating in business administration from the University of Ottawa in 1986. He later became Director of Operations in the Prime Minister’s Office, assuming the leadership of large multidisciplinary teams and initiatives and was also responsible for the organization of major international summits.\nFrom 1994 to 2014, Morgan worked as a strategic planning, communications and public affairs executive in management consulting and public relations. He most recently completed a four-year term with the International Joint Commission, where he was appointed by the Government of Canada to serve as Commissioner.\nCanadian Minister of Environment and Climate Change Catherine McKenna, as the new Chair of the CEC Council, welcomed Morgan to the position.\n“Mr. Morgan is taking on this leadership role as the CEC celebrates its 25th year of successful environmental cooperation across North America. On behalf of the Council, we look forward to working with him to continue to advance environmental and trade priorities, working with governments, local and Indigenous communities, academia, business and youth”, said Minister McKenna.\nRichard A. Morgan will succeed CEC Executive Director César Rafael Chávez who concludes his three-year term with the CEC on July 15. In its 2019 Ministerial Statement, the CEC Council thanked Chávez for his valuable contribution and commitment in leading the CEC Secretariat.\nAbout the CEC\nThe Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC) was established in 1994 by the governments of Canada, Mexico and the United States through the North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation, a parallel environmental agreement to NAFTA. As of 2020, the CEC is recognized and maintained by the Environmental Cooperation Agreement, in parallel with the new Free Trade Agreement of North America. The CEC brings together a wide range of stakeholders, including the general public, Indigenous people, youth, nongovernmental organizations, academia, and the business sector, to seek solutions to protect North America’s shared environment while supporting sustainable development for the benefit of present and future generations\nThe CEC is governed and funded equally by the Government of Canada through Environment and Climate Change Canada, the Government of the United States of Mexico through the Secretaría de Medio Ambiente y Recursos Naturales, and the Government of the United States of America through the Environmental Protection Agency.","The Organization of American States (OAS) is the most important institution in the Western Hemisphere. It comprises 35 States, including the United States, Mexico and Canada.\nFormally, it was born on April 20, 1948, yet its roots can be traced back to the First Conference of American States in 1889-1890. The OAS is an umbrella under which Pan-American relations develop in a number of fields including health, agriculture, security, human rights, democracy, elections, trade, etc.\nThe OAS has its headquarters in Washington, D.C., and historically has been perceived by Latin American and Caribbean countries as an instrument of the American interests within the region. Yet, the United States provides more than half of the OAS budget. For the fiscal year of January 1 to December 31, 2019, the OAS had a budget of $83 million of which the United States was required to provide 51 million or 61 percent.\nOriginally conceived as a way of promoting a high level political dialogue, the United States and Canada joined the OAS during the Cold War with the aim of halting the spread of communism within the region.\nThe institution has faced several problems throughout its more than 70 years. One of the most important obstacles for succeeding in establishing a common agenda in the Americas is the existing imbalance between one of its members and the rest of the participants. Another one is the fact that, because the OAS is headquartered in Washington, D.C., and most of the countries in the region have embassies and diplomatic representations in the same city, most of them prefer to advance their interests through their diplomatic missions to the U.S. rather than the OAS.\nDivisions and rivalries between Latin American and Caribbean countries take a toll when it comes to counterbalancing the American influence and interests within the region. Mexico and Brazil have had a historic rivalry in terms of defining who the Latin America leader is, and also because both have pursued a privileged relationship with Washington. As a result, and because of geopolitical and geographic realities, Mexico has taken most of the attention the U.S. pays to Latin America, whereas Brazil has become a de facto leader or big brother in South America. Brazil also tends to portray Mexico to South American audiences as a puppet of Washington in Latin America. Mexico normally dismisses Brazilian leadership attempts in Latin America by arguing its culture and language differ substantially from most of the countries within the region.\nControversies surrounding the OAS\nCuba is a contentious issue within the OAS. In 1962 the country was suspended from OAS after proclaiming itself as “Marxist-Leninist.” The U.S. broke diplomatic relations with the Fidel Castro regime and prompted Latin American countries to replicate Washington’s stance on Cuba. Yet, during the Obama Administration, Cuba and the United States reestablished diplomatic ties and both Obama and the Cuban leader Raúl Castro met in 2015 on the sidelines of the Summit of the Americas. Previously in 2009, the OAS General Assembly voted unanimously to lift the suspension of Cuba, paving the way for the island to return to the Inter-American system. Until now, however, Cuba has not rejoined the OAS.\nMilitary cooperation within the Western Hemisphere has also been controversial. The Rio Treaty that led to the establishment of the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (TIAR) in 1947, was aimed, purposely, to protecting the Americas from the “Soviet threat” during the Cold Wear. Yet, TIAR was used to perform a naval blockade against Cuba during the 50’s and 60’s and, during the Malvinas War between Argentina and the United Kingdom, the United States sided with London against Buenos Aires, a situation highly criticized by Latin American countries. In fact, in September 2001 Mexico announced it would withdraw from TIAR and left in 2002. Other countries followed, including Bolivia, Ecuador, Nicaragua and Venezuela.\nAccomplishments made by OAS\nSome landmarks in the history of the OAS includes the birth of the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB) in 1959, as well as the launching of the Alliance for Progress in 1961, both as a response to the Cuban Revolution. In 1991 it was agreed that the secretary general of the institution should react within ten days in case a coup d’état develops in any member country. In December 1994, on the occasion of the First Summit of the Americas, the creation of a Free Trade Agreement of the Americas was announced. In 2009, Honduras was suspended when a coup ousted President Manuel Zelaya. Most recently, the OAS has exerted pressure on Venezuela, for failing to comply with the respect of political and self-determination rights of the population so that a democratic government can be elected. President Nicolás Maduro has challenged the OAS due to what he considers interference in Venezuela’s internal affairs and initiated the process to withdraw from the organization.\nDespite criticism against the OAS and its dominance by the United States, the institution has provided a number of critical dialogue and cooperation mechanisms to address relevant issues. For instance, the Pan-American Health Organization (PAHO), based in Washington D. C., is a key player in dealing with health and public sanitation. The Interamerican Human Rights Commission (IHRC) provides human rights monitoring in the region and advises the OAS in this field. Together with the Interamerican Court of Human Rights (IACHR), it examines complaints and petitions regarding specific human rights violations.\nThe Secretary General\nThe secretary general is the leading political representative of the OAS. In the history of the institution 11 diplomats have led the OAS, all men. Of them, two have been Colombian, two Uruguayan, two Chilean, one Ecuadorian, one Argentinian, one Brazilian, one American and one Costa Rican. Mexico has never led the organization. The secretary general is elected for a term of five years and can be re-elected. The current secretary general is the former Minister for Foreign Affairs for Uruguay, Luis Almagro, whose term is about to expire (he arrived at the post on May 26, 2015). Next March 20, either Almagro will be re-elected – he wishes to remain in the position – or someone else will arrive.\nIn addition to Almagro, there are currently two other candidates: María Fernanda Espinosa, the former foreign minister of Ecuador and the Peruvian Ambassador to the U.S., Hugo de Zéla. Normally governments support their candidates but this time two out of three candidacies are not endorsed by their respective governments: neither Almagro nor Espinosa are supported by Uruguay and Ecuador respectively. The only candidate who is supported by his country of origin is De Zéla.\nThis unusual situation leads to an unreliable forecast. Before leading the OAS, Almagro was foreign minister of Uruguay where he championed the support of refugees and orchestrated with the José Mujica government the welcome of dozens of Syrians who escaped violence in their homeland. He was also instrumental in the transfer of former prisoners from Guantanamo Bay to Uruguay. Then, on March 18, 2015, he was elected by 33 of 34 member states as secretary general. During his term, he has been very active in the electoral process in Haiti; the fight against corruption in Honduras; the call for democratic elections in Venezuela; the strengthening of democratic institutions in Nicaragua; and, most recently, the downfall of Evo Morales after elections where Morales, it is presumed, intended to stay in power despite a number of electoral irregularities documented by the OAS.\nTo some countries, Almagro should continue as secretary general. The United States has endorsed his candidacy, together with Colombia. These governments like Almagro’s despising of left-wing governments -o r at least that’s what Washington and Bogota thinks. This paves the way for the support of Brazil’s Bolsonaro. This means that countries with which Almagro has collided for different reasons – such as Venezuela, Nicaragua and, most important, Mexico -who has provided support for Evo Morales and members of is government- won’t vote for him.\nPlease bear in mind that any candidate, in order to become secretary general, requires 18 votes. As suggested before, Tabaré Vázquez, president of Uruguay, has not endorsed Almagro’s candidacy and he has stated that other countries and personalities should participate in the renewal of the OAS leadership. Then comes María Fernanda Espinosa, who faces a similar scenario because her native Ecuador doesn’t support her candidacy, which instead has been propelled by small Caribbean countries such as Antigua and Barbuda and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines. She may be getting support from other countries, possibly Argentina. The credentials of Espinosa are nevertheless impressive: she was elected back in 2018 as president of the United Nations General Assembly, thus becoming the first Latin American woman to hold that position. Previously she has been foreign minister twice and minister of defense in Ecuador.\nIf elected to the OAS Espinosa would become the first woman in the history of the organization to lead it. Yet, Espinosa is not well-liked by central and/or liberal governments in the region, because she is considered a left-wing politician, married to Eduardo Mangas, a Nicaraguan who previously served in the Sandinista government of Daniel Ortega. Lenin Moreno, currently president of Ecuador, and despite being considered a centrist-left wing politician, has moved closely to the right and has sought to improve his country’s relationship with the U.S. Following a visit of the U.S. Vice President Mike Pence to Ecuador in 2018, Moreno approved a number of initiatives including the purchase of arms and a weapons system from the Americans and, more importantly, he withdrew protection provided to Wikileaks’ founder, Julian Assange, who had been granted political asylum in August 2012 at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London by then President Rafael Correa. Thus, on April 11, 2019, Assange was arrested by the British police. Having this background in mind, Moreno is not able to support Espinosa at this critical juncture.\nFinally, the third candidate, the only one whose candidacy has been endorsed by his own government ,is the Peruvian diplomat Hugo De Zela. Considering that Almagro is well-liked by the U.S. and that Espinosa is seen as a leftist, the bet of Peru is that Hugo De Zela could become an intermediate option in case neither of the former gets the required 18 votes. How would Mexico vote? Most probably for Espinosa, but if this threatens to create frictions with the United States, then De Zela could be a safer bet for the Lopez Obrador Government.\nThe debate on the election of the secretary general of the OAS has become more complex due to a highly divided region, with Bolsonaro to the right, Mexico to the left -or something like that – and, in between, countries that need to sort out a number of problems. Demonstrations in Chile, Haiti, Colombia, etc., last year showed societies tired of politics as usual. Most countries tend to look indoors and may be prioritizing domestic over international affairs – with few exceptions, as Argentina’s Alberto Fernández has shown. This means countries don’t seem eager to getting involved in a never-ending debate over who is best equipped to lead the OAS. Most of the region may want this election to develop fast and without much fuss.\nNeedless to say, the U.S. will have presidential elections this year. Even though the Trump Administration has criticized the OAS among other things for advocating for the legalization of abortion, and has even threatened to cut its financial contributions for the organization, he doesn’t need a major crisis in the Western Hemisphere that may distract him from his most important goal – say, re-election. Thus, the sooner the “OAS file” is solved, the better. Yet, again, critics of the OAS may claim that this is business as usual, with the U.S. deciding what’s best for the region, even though the region disagrees.\nEditor’s Note: The main image accompanying the above guest column shows Luis Almagro, Secretary General of the Organization of American States."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:dd1b1a2e-de6c-4333-a242-62b476f0231a>","<urn:uuid:30b5fbcc-32dc-4cb8-bdf0-7220773e9e86>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the best timing for applying winter protection to plants, and how can anti-desiccants help prevent winter damage? 🌱","answer":"Winter protection should not be applied too early as it can interfere with plants' natural ability to harden off. Wait until late November, after a hard frost or two, before applying mulch. As for anti-desiccants, they should be applied when day temperatures begin dropping below 50°F, on a dry day with no rain or snow expected within 24 hours. These materials add a protective coating to plant leaves to help retain moisture, which is crucial since plants can die during winter from desiccation when their roots cannot take water from frozen soil. Anti-desiccants need to be reapplied in late winter on a dry day when temperatures are above freezing for at least 24 hours, as they break down in light and warmth.","context":["PROTECTING PLANTS FROM WINTER DAMAGE\nBy Dr. Vern Grubinger\nExtension Vegetable and Berry Specialist\nUniversity of Vermont\nBesides ice dams on the roof and piles\nof snow in the driveway, horticultural injury is a fact\nof life during northern winters. Surprisingly, there\nare many ways that otherwise long-lived plants may meet\ntheir demise in between growing seasons.\nDirect injury from exposure to cold temperature\nis the most obvious, and as a result, most gardeners\nand homeowners pay attention to maps of plant hardiness\nzones. These define the average annual minimum temperature\nof geographical areas based on years of meteorological\nThe southern corners of Vermont are in\nzone 5a, where the average minimum temperature is between\n15 and 20 degrees F below zero. That's why some people\ncall it the \"Banana Belt.\" Up in the Northeast\nKingdom, it's zone 3b, where the coldest temperature\neach year averages 30 to 35 F below.\nAvoiding the problem is one way to prevent\nwinter injury to your plants. Be sure to buy the hardiest\nplants you can find. When selecting species or varieties,\nnever choose those that aren't suited for your hardiness\nOf course, hardiness zones are based on\naverages, and that can lead to problems because some\nyears are colder than average. That's why it's advisable\nto err on the side of caution when choosing plant varieties\nbased on hardiness claims. If possible, purchase plants\nthat are suited to survive in a hardiness zone colder\nthan yours. If you must put in\"marginally hardy\"\nplantings, try to place them in protected areas, where\nthe winds are reduced by the presence of structures\nor by the topography.\nWinter conditions can cause the death\nof plants in many ways. Their tops or roots may freeze\nor plants may dry out when whipped by persistent winds.\nSometimes, roots are heaved out of the ground by alternate\nfreezing and thawing.\nSunny winter days followed by frigid nights\ncreate rapid temperature variations that really hurt\nplants. Ice storms can cause breakage of stems and limbs.\nMice and deer browsing for food also may cause damage.\nWhat's a grower to do?\nFor many valuable crops, winter protection\nis essential. But protecting crops too early can interfere\nwith the plant's natural ability to adjust for winter\nor \"harden off.\" The first step to take for\nwinter protection is to wait, so that plants are given\nenough time in the late fall to properly harden off.\nDon't apply mulch too early, and don't\napply nitrogen (N) late in the season. Too much available\nN, whether from fertilizers or manure, keeps plants\nsucculent in the autumn and increases susceptibility\nto winter injury.\nMulching plants is a means of stabilizing\nsoil against freezing and thawing. A thick layer of\nweed-free organic residue-like straw is best. Because\nstraw has hollow stems, it is a very good insulator.\nLeaves also can be used, but if they mat\ndown, their insulating value is diminished, and they\nmay smother plants. Mulch should be applied in late\nNovember, after a hard frost or two.\nWhen mulching roses, cut the canes back\nto 18 inches, surround with chicken wire, and cover\nthe whole plant to protect shoots as well as roots.\nLow-growing perennial flowers, strawberries, and the\nlike are easy enough to cover completely, but they may\nrequire re-covering if the winds blow off the mulch.\nFor grape varieties that are not very\nhardy, remove the vines from the trellis and lay them\non the ground before mulching. For upright plants that\ncannot be lowered to the ground, erecting a fence of\nsome kind can protect plants against drying winds. Burlap\nor other material stretched between posts works well.\nSo does snow fence. It breaks the wind somewhat even\nwhen there's no snow, and works really well to protect\nplants when there is snow.\nAntidesiccants are materials that add\na protective coating to plant leaves, helping them to\nretain their moisture. These can be sprayed on leaves\nof some plants to reduce the loss of water in winter.\nIn northern climates, winter injury to\nplants is hard to avoid. With proper precautions, it\ncan be minimized,but be prepared next spring to prune\naway winter-killed canes and limbs and to remove dead\nplants. These can be a source of plant disease if left","You’ve removed late-autumn weeds, layered on the mulch, pruned appropriately, possibly even covered or wrapped your plants – so why do some still die in the winter, despite all your well-meaning efforts?\nMany plants die during winter because they dry out, or desiccate. As temperatures drop, the ground freezes and plant roots cannot take water from the soil, no matter how much snow may fall. This causes the plant to use stored water from the leaves and stems as part of the transpiration process, during which water exits the plant through the leaves. If the sun is shining or the wind is blowing, transpiration increases and more water exits the leaves. If no water is available and transpiration continues, the plant will soon die. Because evergreen plants do not drop their leaves, they are especially susceptible to this death.\nHow can you help your plants stay well-hydrated through the frozen drought of winter? The first step is to remember healthy plants in the summer survive the hardships of winter far better than sickly or stressed plants. Through the spring, summer and fall, you should always be on the lookout for signs of pests, diseases and damage, and take all necessary steps to keep your plants thriving.\nSecond, be sure to water well even when temperatures begin dropping below freezing. Later, if the ground thaws, water before the ground refreezes. Water slowly to provide a deep drink without waterlogging the roots, however, so they are not damaged by ice.\nThe third step is to use an anti-desiccant, also called an anti-transpirant, to reduce the moisture loss from the leaves and needles. Because broadleaf evergreens such as boxwood, aucuba, holly, rhododendron, many laurels, Japanese skimmia and leucothoe do not drop their leaves, they are especially vulnerable to winter death. Using a product such as Wilt-Pruf to reduce transpiration by protecting the pores will save many broadleaf evergreens.\nWhen using any horticultural product, be sure to check the label and follow all instructions properly. Some conifers such as cedar, cypress, juniper and pine may benefit from these products. However, be sure to read the instructions to prevent burning specific conifers. Also, do not use on “waxy” blue conifers, such as blue spruce, which already have an oily protective film on the nettles.\nHere are a few reminders to get the best protection from an anti-desiccant:\n- Plan to apply when day temperatures begin dropping below 50⁰ Fahrenheit. Apply when temperatures are above freezing on a dry day with no rain or snow anticipated within 24 hours. This allows the product to thoroughly dry. Spraying in freezing temperatures will cause plant damage.\n- Do not spray conifers until thoroughly dormant, generally in late winter. This prevents trapping moisture in the needles which could burst when frozen.\n- Generously apply to dry leaves and needles. Don’t forget the undersides. Spray from several angles to ensure complete coverage.\n- Because the anti-desiccant will break down in light and warmth, reapply in late winter on a dry day when temperatures are above freezing for at least 24 hours.\nBeyond Winter Drought\nOther than protecting your landscape evergreens from winter drought, there are other uses for anti-desiccants. Many gardeners use it to protect newly transplanted shrubs from drying winds and sunshine as they settle in. It also provides protection to tender bulbs going into storage. A quick spray in early winter protects rose canes and hydrangea stems. Spraying onto live or cut Christmas trees and carved pumpkins slows the drying process, making them last longer for greater holiday enjoyment.\nTo answer your questions, or to choose the best product for your landscape plants, come in to discuss anti-desiccants with one of our friendly and knowledgeable staff members. Together, we can reduce the number of plants you lose to the dryness of winter and keep your garden beautiful and healthy."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c72f7763-2f12-40a5-bb16-c79eb033de77>","<urn:uuid:2ad5c424-599b-49ab-b03a-677385a46618>"],"error":null}

Commit to taking your dog to your veterinarian for annual checkups; consider twice-annual visits for dogs seven years of age and older.\nShould you vaccinate your dog? Should your dog receive all the recommended vaccines at once? How important are common shots, like the DHPP vaccine, or rabies vaccine? Over-vaccinating dogs is a definite problem in the veterinary world, but immunizing your pet is nonetheless a necessary part of having one.\nYou check your mailbox and there it is: a reminder postcard from your dog’s veterinarian. If you’re like many of us dog owners, you groan and toss the card aside.\nIf you’ve not yet found an enlightened, up-to-date veterinarian, the postcard is likely to say, “It’s time for your dog’s annual vaccinations! Call us today for an appointment!”\nWe hope, however, that you’ve done your homework and found a veterinary practice whose postcards say something more like, “It’s time for your dog’s wellness examination! Call us today for an appointment!”\nEducate yourself on canine vaccination practices using reputable sources so that you can have an intelligent conversation with your veterinarian on the pros and cons of vaccination for your dog; a good place to start are the AAHA Guidelines.\nWhat’s the difference? In 2003, the American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) revised its vaccination guidelines, recommending that vets vaccinate adult dogs only every three years – not annually. Many enlightened veterinarians changed their canine healthcare protocols to reflect the guidelines, and now suggest annual wellness examinations with vaccinations only every three years.\nVaccines for Dogs: The Basics\nCore vaccines protect animals from severe, life-threatening diseases that have global distribution. According to the AAHA, core vaccines that every dog should receive initially as a puppy (a series of three vaccines given between 8-16 weeks of age) are:\n1. canine distemper (CDV)\n2. canine parvovirus 2 (CPV-2)\n3. canine adenovirus 2 (CAV)\nThe core vaccines should be administered one year later, and every three years thereafter, unless antibody titer test results indicate that the dog possesses antibody levels that have been determined to be protective.\nThe rabies vaccine is also considered a core vaccine, but should be given once at age 12 to 16 weeks (or as late as local law allows), then again one year later, followed by every three years. (Unfortunately, some locales require rabies vaccination more frequently than every three years, so check your local laws.)\nNon-core vaccinations should be administered only to dogs whose geographical location, local environment, or lifestyle place them at risk of contracting each of the speciﬁc infections. These vaccines are:\n- Bordetella bronchiseptica (kennel cough) & parainﬂuenza\n- Borrelia burgdorferi (Lyme)\nNote: The above recommendations are per the AAHA. Dr. Dodds advocates administration of the initial rabies vaccine after 20 weeks of age (if allowable by local law).\nBe Prepared with Your Dog's Vaccination History\nThat said, don’t think for a minute that you need to take your dog to the vet only every three years. It’s imperative that you take your canine companions in for yearly checkups. Rather than throw that postcard in the trash, pick up the phone and call for an appointment. Yearly wellness examinations help our veterinarians develop a good baseline on our dog’s health, be better able to take notice of subtle changes in his health over time, and develop a relationship with our dog and us.\nWhile these annual trips to the vet might now be called “wellness checks” rather than “vaccine visits,” the odds are good that the topic of vaccines will come up. And despite our good intentions, many of us head in with our dog for his annual exam and feel blindsided as the vet suggests an array of vaccines for our dogs. Often, we nod in agreement, get that “deer in the headlights” look and agree with her recommendations (she is the expert after all), then go home with regrets.\nRemember the Scout motto and “Be prepared” as you get ready for your dog’s next veterinary appointment. Being prepared means more than remembering to take your dog’s leash, collar with ID, treats, and showing up on time, on the right day, with the right dog.\nHow to best prepare for your dog’s annual veterinary visit and be ready for a discussion on the most appropriate vaccine strategy for him?\n◾Bring veterinary records and/or a list with you of your dog’s vaccination history; do not assume the veterinary clinic will have all the most recent information, especially if you’ve changed clinics. Other test dates and results to bring include most recent heartworm test, antibody titer test results, and blood and/or urinalysis test results. Ideally, you’ll collect all the data ahead of time and enter into a table so that you have a timeline of the pet’s life.\nOften its best to have a health record with dates of every vaccine, deworming, flee/tick treatment, and any other treatments available at a glance... See the link for Health record\n◾Have a clear idea in your mind whether you want/need your dog to receive any vaccinations (and for which diseases), an antibody titer test, or none of the above. If you are unsure, cultivate a good understanding of the vaccines available. And ask your veterinarian if any particular vaccines are warranted due to conditions in the area in which you live.\n◾Educate yourself using reputable sources so that you can have an intelligent conversation with your veterinarian on the pros and cons of vaccination for your dog; a good place to start are the AAHA Guidelines. Writings and research by Ronald Schultz, PhD, DACVIM, and Jean Dodds, DVM, are also excellent references.\n◾Know the status of your dog’s health, and whether he has any health or behavioral issues that your veterinarian should be aware of.\n◾Bring a list of your dog’s current medications and supplements, including dose, strength, and frequency.\n◾Have an idea of what the visit will cost, including any tests, to avoid sticker shock or making hasty (bad) decisions based solely on price. Call ahead.\n◾Be prepared to take your dog and go home if you are uncomfortable with your veterinarian’s recommendations. There’s no need to get nasty or defensive. We suggest something along the lines of, “I’m not sure I’m comfortable with those recommendations. I’d like to go home and think about them.”\nIf you are going to see a veterinarian who is new to you and your dog, consider making an appointment with the veterinarian, without your dog, to discuss her philosophy toward vaccinations and antibody titer tests.\nyour veterinarian suggesting that your dog is \"due\" for certain vaccines does NOT mean your dog must have those vaccines!\nHow Antibody Titer Tests May Affect Your Decisions\nAntigens are any substance that the immune system identifies as an invader and responds to by producing a chemical defense: antibodies. When everything is working as it should, your dog’s immune system will recognize disease antigens that were introduced to his system via a vaccine (weakened or killed) or by natural exposure to the antigen that causes the disease (viral or bacterial).\nA “titer” is a measurement of how much antibody to a certain antigen is circulating in the blood at that moment. The result is usually expressed in a ratio. A positive titer test result is strongly correlated with a good antibody response to either a recent infection or vaccination. A dog who has received “core” vaccines and who displays a positive antibody titer test result should be considered protected from the diseases for which he was vaccinated (meaning, he doesn’t need vaccines at that time). See \"Vaccine Titer Tests,\" for more insight.\nYour dog must undergo a blood draw in order to have an antibody titer test. Labs such as Antech, IDEXX, and most veterinary college laboratories offer these tests. Antibody titer testing is typically run for parvovirus and distemper, since the dog’s antibody response to these two antigens is highly predictive as to the dog’s immunologic competence in dealing with any other antigen to which he has been exposed.\nRarely, there are exceptions. When an antibody titer test is negative, the owner and veterinarian should consider revaccinating and then testing the titers again. It may turn out that the animal simply needed another exposure to the antigen in order to stimulate a stronger immune response. Or, it may develop that the dog lacks the ability to respond normally to vaccines, that is, by mounting a proper immune response. In this case, the owner and veterinarian have gained very valuable information about the dog’s compromised immune status – information they never would have gained by simply vaccinating and assuming the dog was “protected,” as is usually the case with healthy dogs.\nIf You Choose to Vaccinate Your Dog\nIf you determine that your dog is in need of vaccination, consider the following:\n◾Ask the veterinarian to perform the health exam and other tests first; you might even wait to vaccinate until those results are in, and schedule a follow-up vaccine visit once you know your dog is in the clear, health-wise.\n◾At a minimum, try to schedule the rabies vaccine for a different visit than the other vaccines, if your dog needs them. The rabies vaccine should be administered by itself at a later date, apart from the other three “core” vaccines (distemper, parvo-virus, and adenovirus), and in another part of the dog’s body.\nIf you’re considering vaccinating simply for financial reasons (because vaccines cost less than running a titer test) a well-planned vaccine/titer strategy might have you coming out ahead in the long run if you scale back on vaccines and run titers on a strategically planned schedule.\nVeterinary medicine today has advanced to the point of acknowledging that there is no single “perfect” vaccine program; vaccine programs must be tailored to the specific needs of each animal. Although there is a tendency to want to treat all dogs the same, the program should be designed for the individual, not the masses. The dog’s health, age, environment, activities, lifestyle, and whether he has previously had any adverse vaccine reactions all need to figure in to the equation.\nIt’s Up to You to Make Vaccination Decisions\nDon’t expect your veterinarian to ask you broadly what you want to do when you take your dog in for an annual exam. Most veterinarians, unless prompted by the client, will assume that you’re there for “the usual” and will go ahead and recommend annual vaccinations. It is up to you to educate yourself and advocate for your dog and know what vaccines and tests might benefit him, and to know the laws concerning how frequently the rabies vaccine must be administered.\nLisa Rodier is a frequent contributor to WDJ. She lives in Alpharetta, Georgia, with her husband and two Bouviers, and volunteers with the American Bouvier Rescue League.\nFor most of us who share our lives with dogs, making sure they are vaccinated tops the list of preventive-care tasks. We mindfully take our puppies or newly adopted dogs for their recommended\nvaccines. We routinely return to our veterinarian or vaccine clinic when that postcard or email arrives, reminding us that our dogs are due for booster shots. We know vaccination offers critical\nprotection from diseases such as canine parvovirus, canine distemper virus, rabies and more.\nHowever, many of us question the concept of “routine” when it comes to vaccinations. While grateful for the protection that vaccines offer, we are increasingly aware of their possible unintended consequences. After all, people are not continuing to be re vaccinated as adults for every disease. That’s where titer testing comes in.\nTiter tests are among the tools that dog owners and veterinarians can use to help minimize the risks of both infectious diseases and unnecessary vaccinations. Simply put, these tests can tell you if a previous vaccine is still protecting your dog. If it’s still working, you don’t have to revaccinate.\nDr. Evelyn Sharp a Vet in Santa Cruz, Calif., has used titer tests with her own dogs since she began practicing veterinary medicine in the mid-1990s. The first dog she regularly tested was her Border Collie mix, Ace. Titers showed that the protection provided by Ace’s initial puppy series and one-year booster lasted the rest of his life. With the recent availability of in-practice titer-test kits—VacciCheck from Biogal Laboratories and TiterCHEK from Synbiotics Corporation—titer testing has become even easier to do.\nBecause the newer titer-test kits are affordable, accurate and can be run inhouse (rather than by a lab), Dr. Sharp now suggests titer testing as part of preventive care. With the information she gets from the titers, she can provide a customized vaccination protocol for each dog, keeping the dog well protected while minimizing the risks of over-vaccination.\nThe most recent American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA) Canine Vaccination Guidelines say that reported side effects from vaccines vary from injection-site reactions, lethargy, lack of appetite and fever to more serious adverse events, including allergic reactions, autoimmune problems and, rarely, sarcoma or other tumors. The decision about when to vaccinate requires a risk/benefit analysis. Most experts agree that vaccines are critical to the overall health and wellness of our dogs (and cats), but many also agree that giving a vaccine when it is not needed exposes animals to unnecessary hazards.\nSo what exactly is involved in titer testing? A “titer” is a method of measuring antibodies in a blood sample for specific diseases. Your vet will draw a small amount of blood and then run that blood through the test. Titers are usually expressed as a ratio; if the titer number is high, it means that your dog has enough antibodies to fight off that specific disease and is considered to have immunity from infection. For many of our dogs, that immunity is the result of a previous vaccine. However, immunity can also develop because a dog had the disease in the past. Either way, a high titer means your dog is protected.\nIf the test shows a low titer, your dog may not have immunity. The interesting and perhaps odd detail (odd, at least, from a layperson’s viewpoint) is that a low titer is not completely definitive. A dog may still have some protection. Still, the accepted standard with the in-house test kit is that a low titer means that you and your veterinarian should discuss revaccinating.\nJust as vaccine prices vary, the price of a titer test can also vary from veterinary practice to veterinary practice. According to Dr. Sharp, the VacciCheck tests three diseases—parvovirus, distemper and adenovirus (canine hepatitis)— and generally runs between $45 and $80, which is a little more than most vaccines, but not unreasonably high.\nAAHA vaccine guidelines say that titer testing is an appropriate way to check for immunity to parvovirus, distemper and adenovirus. However, it is not recommended for canine leptospirosis, bordetella or Lyme disease, because these vaccines only provide short-term protection.\nRabies vaccines do provide long-term protection, and the titer tests for rabies are also considered to be a very accurate measure of immunity. However, vaccination against rabies is mandated by law and at this time, no state in the U.S. accepts titer-test results in lieu of vaccination history. If your dog bites someone, she will still need to be quarantined, even if a titer test shows she has immunity. Specific types of rabies titer tests are used, however, when moving to rabies-free countries or regions—for example, Hawaii, Guam, Japan, New Zealand or Great Britain. In this case, the rabies titer test will help qualify a dog for a shorter quarantine.\nAlong with using titer tests to check for immunity to parvovirus, distemper and adenovirus in a previously vaccinated adult dog, titers are also a good option for a newly adopted dog whose vaccination or health history you may not know. In addition, a titer test may be used to make sure young puppies have responded to the initial vaccine series and are fully protected. If a pup did not respond, the vaccine may have been compromised, the mother’s immunity may still be active or the pup may be a non-responder (meaning she will not have an immune reaction to vaccines). Your veterinarian can help you decide on the best course of action if your pup does not have an acceptable titer.\nWhile vaccinating animals against infectious diseases is critical to protecting individual dogs and communities at large, over-vaccinating is also a real concern for those of us who share our lives with dogs. Titer tests give us another tool and can help when it comes time to discuss vaccines with our veterinarian and make the best health-care decisions for our dogs.\nPapillon Breeder of:\nAKC Champions and Grand Champions\nAKC Agility titles\nAKC Obedience and rally titles\nService Dogs, Hearing dogs\nAKC Trick dogs,\nAKC Barn Hunt,\nAKC scent work\nAKC dock diving and more.\nThe Butterfly dog that does it all\nMiddleville, Michigan 49333\nPhone: +1 6162171616","Preventive care involves more than just ensuring that your pet has the right shots at the right time. Responsible preventive care involves an adequate vaccination program, comprehensive parasite control, controlled exercise that is sufficient to satisfy your dog's needs, and grooming. Vaccination or inoculation simulates the dog to produce active immunity against one or more diseases without developing any symptoms of that disease. In order to achieve this, the causative microorganisms (bacteria or viruses) have to be altered. They are either killed (inactivated) or weakened (attenuated) sufficiently, so as not to cause the disease but to stimulate a workable immunity. The altered microorganisms can be introduced into the body by various routes. For example, vaccination against kennel cough (infectious bronchotracheitis) is by administration of nasal drops. Inoculation, on the other hand, usually involves an injection. Irrespective of the method, the body produces an active immunity that lasts a variable time without boosting. This depends on the type of vaccine and the disease.\nPuppy Immunity and Boosters\nThere are several types of immunity that require different vaccination approach. Puppies are usually born with some immunity that they acquire from their mother while still in the womb. The necessary antibodies are carried in the blood and cross the placenta into the puppy. This acquired (passive) immunity soon wanes, which is why vaccinations are necessary. Modern vaccines confer solid protection in the shortest possible time, even when circulating maternal antibodies are present, and can be completed by ten to twelve weeks of age, affording the puppy early immunity. Because vaccination does not give lifelong immunity, reinforcement (boosting) will be required. Another reason for boosters is that the amount of immunity conferred varies with the disease and is also determined by whether the vaccine is attenuated or inactivated. Generally, killed vaccines last a much shorter time. The problem is when to administer them.\nCombined vaccines and boosters have their positive and negative aspects and vaccination programs should take into account the unique state of an animal's immune system. Modern canine vaccines cover several diseases with one course of injections. This is for reasons of cost and convenience. Some components, however, particularly inactivated (killed) vaccines, such as the one against leptospirosis, are known to confer only a short immunity, often measured in months. With any combined (multivalent) vaccine, the efficacy of the product as a whole is considered in relation to the component that gives the shortest period of effective protection. Therefore, although protection against disease such as distemper and hepatitis will last for much linger than a year, because these are combined with leptospirosis, the manufacturer's recommendation will be that an annual booster of the multivalent vaccine is advised. Recent concern regarding the possibility of some dogs developing reactions to booster vaccination has led to a rethink, and manufacturer's recommendations are beginning to change. Primary vaccination and boosters are now tailored for the individual and the area. Discuss this with your local veterinary surgeon at the time of the primary vaccination. There is concern that problems, particularly those of an autoimmune nature, can be caused by over-vaccination, particularly \"over-boosting.\" Blood test are available, both for puppies and adult dogs, that will accurately indicate whether immunity has fallen to a level where the dog is at risk and boosting is advised. However, the cost of testing for one disease will probably be equal to, if not more than, the cost of a combined re-vaccination for all the diseases. There is also the question of stress for the dog.\nAnother negative aspect of vaccination is vaccinosis, which is a chronic disease caused by adverse effects of vaccination. About one in ten-thousand cats develops a sarcoma - a tumor of connective tissue - within a few months of receiving routine vaccinations. Though these tumors have been known to appear at other locations, they most often develop at or near the injection site. A group of veterinary scientists, researchers, and clinical veterinarians formed the American Veterinary Medical Association Vaccine-Associated Sarcoma Task Force (AVMA-VASTF) to examine the known facts about the sarcomas reported. It was determined that sarcomas most often appeared after administration of the rabies and Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV) vaccines. One major recommendation was to discontinue the use of polyvalent (combined vaccines - that is, several vaccines combined in a single injection). While such combination shots are more convenient, and possibly cheaper, the Task Force determined that these shots were forcing additional vaccines on cats who didn't need them and were also producing an unacceptable high number of side affects. Because of the concerns expressed regarding vaccinations, the number of components combined in each injection, and the recommendation of annual repeats, vaccines have recently been divided into two groups: core vaccines and noncore vaccines.\nMany veterinarians are now recommending the measurement of antibody titers to diseases normally vaccinated against as an alternative to routine annual vaccination. An antibody titer may help determine whether or not a patient is likely to need a booster vaccinations, although there is still much uncertainty surrounding titer use. Antibody titers are more costly than vaccines."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d5ca1cba-3b9e-4db1-8437-0daba5a68d2a>","<urn:uuid:2bbd0fac-962a-4350-b58f-8925d48e2f7e>"],"error":null}

{"question":"Can you explain how modern infrastructure maintenance systems handle both cyber and physical threats, particularly in the context of transportation equipment?","answer":"Modern infrastructure maintenance systems must address both cyber and physical threats in a comprehensive manner. On the cyber side, systems face risks from malware, hackers, and internal threats that can damage IT equipment, disrupt communications, and corrupt software systems or stored data. The physical threat landscape includes risks to actual equipment and infrastructure, such as theft of components, damage from severe weather events, and disruption from hazardous materials incidents. In military applications, this dual threat environment is being addressed through AI-powered maintenance systems that can predict equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules, while simultaneously considering physical security threats. For example, the U.S. Army's pilot program with Uptake analyzes vehicle diagnostic data while accounting for various operational constraints and security considerations.","context":["Going into combat is difficult enough as it is and the last thing you want on the battlefield is to have your equipment break down, especially something as critical as the vehicle that’s getting you around.\nThat’s why the U.S. Army spends millions of dollars every year making sure its infantry vehicles are ready for action. And officials think artificial intelligence could make maintenance more effective by lowering costs and giving commanders a better understanding of their fleets.\nLast month the Army kicked off a pilot program with Uptake, a Chicago-based industrial technology startup, to test whether the company’s AI-powered platform can predict when components on the M2A3 Bradley Fighting Vehicle will break down. If the program is successful, the Army could ultimately scale the technology to the thousands of Bradleys it operates across the globe.\n“Maintenance costs are one of our biggest concerns in the military in regards to sustaining the fleet,” said Chief Warrant Officer Jason Sibley, who serves as a maintenance technical adviser for armored fighting vehicles. “We’re doing all that we can to ensure the military is being supported as best as possible … so given the opportunity we have to be able to save costs in regards to sustaining the fleet, [artificial intelligence] is definitely an opportunity we want to look at.”\nUptake in July won the $1 million contract through the Defense Innovation Unit, a Pentagon startup outreach program that was rebranded Thursday. Under the agreement, Uptake will deploy its software on 32 Bradleys stationed at Fort Hood in Texas and work to predict when future repairs are needed and optimize the timing of general maintenance.\nThe company’s software, which is already used by industrial giants like Caterpillar and Berkshire Hathaway Energy, crunches data from diagnostic computers onboard the Bradleys as well as information about prior maintenance to determine how specific parts perform over time, said Uptake Federal and Defense Director Trey Clark in a conversation with Nextgov.\nThe program can then compare that information with a trove of historic machine data and estimate how long a specific component will last and alert Army technicians when maintenance is needed.\nIt could also prevent the Army from doing unnecessary preventative maintenance work, saving time and money.\nToday, the Army annually spends $58.6 million to operate and maintain its fleet of M2A3 Bradleys, according to data provided by Sibley. That breaks down to roughly $47,000 per vehicle, or about $160 for every mile driven.\nMuch of that cost stems from the rigorous maintenance standards the Army upholds. Every Bradley is subject to weekly maintenance checks, as well as more intrusive quarterly, semi-annual and annual inspections, Sibley told Nextgov. But using Uptake’s software, technicians could get a better idea of which components need changing out and which ones have more life left in them.\n“What we don’t want to do is we don’t want to preemptively spend a lot of money changing out parts that could withhold [more use]” Sibley said. “We’re always looking at opportunities to determine and validate whether the amount of maintenance that we perform currently is what’s needed for the platform itself. Can [maintenance standards] be safely pushed out a little bit further?”\nDuring the pilot, Uptake will only analyze a handful of the Bradley’s components, Sibley said. While he declined to estimate the potential savings Uptake’s AI would bring, he said the Army is particularly interested in its uses for “sophisticated electronics” and other high-cost items.\nBeyond general maintenance, the software could also give commanders in the field an in-depth understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the vehicles at their disposal.\nImagine a commander is planning a dangerous mission that requires three Bradleys, but they have 10 to choose from. Right now they would select vehicles based on intuition and potentially outdated information, Clark said, but with real-time diagnostic data, that commander could pick the ones that are truly the most prepared for battle.\n“To be able to project [diagnostics] straight back to the commander and give him an operational view to make choices regarding his fleet, that’s definitely something that’s going to be new that we’re looking forward to,” Sibley said.\nThe pilot will conclude roughly one year from now, at which point the Army will assess whether to scale the program to cover more components or vehicles, he added.","Security threats can be divided into those which:\n- have the capability to cause damage or disruption to the construction, operation or maintenance of the highway infrastructure (the physical infrastructure)\n- could damage or disrupt the infrastructure operating systems and associated information (the ITS infrastructure).\nThreats can also be unintentional, non-directed or unpredicted – for example:\n- severe weather events\n- incidents involving hazardous materials\n- road traffic collisions\n- fall-out from disruption to other transport modes\n- the jamming or interference with navigation signals caused by natural factors\n- malware infection on an IT system.\nThe potential level of impact will depend on the criticality of the asset, system or information affected. An example is shown in the photo below.\nDamage or disruption to the construction, operation or maintenance of the road infrastructure may arise from a number of threats.\nCivil protests and strikes\nCivil protests and strikes are most likely to arise from social unrest and civil disobedience. Sometimes this is in response to the construction of assets that are sensitive for environmental, social, economic or political reasons. They have the potential to disrupt or delay operations and can be expensive to manage – and expensive in relation to the final cost of the work being undertaken.\nA malicious attack can occur through a range of external and internal/insider threats. These include damage caused by malware, hackers, disaffected personnel or blast. The result of an attack – in relation to the construction, operation and maintenance of the road network – is likely to centre on physical damage/sabotage to the infrastructure, plant or equipment, or disruption to road users.\nSevere weather events\nSevere and adverse weather – such as periods of rain, flooding, hard frost, snow, prolonged dry weather, excess heat, high winds, dust storms and earthquakes can cause serious disruption and dangerous driving conditions – as well as considerable damage to the network, in particular:\n- the pavement surface condition and structural strength\n- the stability of surrounding and underlying ground and earthworks\n- sensors embedded within the network.\n- The risks of adverse weather can be mitigated to a degree by the installation of road sensor and weather stations at locations that have a high level of exposure. (See.Weather Monitoring)\nPandemics can affect humans, agricultural livestock and wildlife. They can impact on:\n- a population’s capability to travel and to access needed facilities\n- the willingness and ability of staff and external resources – such as contractors and maintenance staff – to enter an area to undertake work.\nTheft of equipment\nDepending on the type of equipment, theft can impact directly on traffic operations and on the ability of an authority, and the cost to it, of constructing, maintaining and improving transport infrastructure. It can also have a direct influence on road user safety – and the capability of an authority to manage traffic behaviour and enhance a network’s capacity.\nHazardous materials (solids, liquids and gases that can be flammable, corrosive or toxic) are frequently transported by road. They are also used within highway construction and management – and may be stored, processed, or used adjacent (or in close proximity) to the road network. An incident involving hazardous materials can lead to closure of the highway – or damage to it and its supporting systems.\nRoad traffic collisions can cause damage to:\n- pavement surface condition\n- structures such as bridges\n- infrastructure such as gantry signs and traffic management equipment\n- sensors embedded within the network.\n- Incidents can also lead to prolonged closure of the highway and have significant social and economic costs. (See Incident Response Plans)\nFall-out from disruption to other modes (rail, ports, airports)\nDisruption to other modes of transport can have a significant effect on road traffic. It can force users to make alternative travel arrangements or – where this is not possible or cost effective (for example, in the case of transportation of freight) – to wait until the disruption has been resolved. Contingency plans may be necessary for parking vehicles that are held up by disruption.\nGlobal Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS)\nThe jamming of, or interference with, navigation signals may be caused by human factors, such as intentional or malicious acts/attack, or natural factors such as solar flares and disturbance to the ionosphere. It can result in the loss of precision location information, failure of in-vehicle navigation systems and/or loss of accurate timing signals for area-wide systems.\nDamage or disruption to the ITS infrastructure, operating systems and associated information may arise from:\n- similar threats to those facing the physical infrastructure – although with different impacts\n- and from threats directly associated with digital technology\nA malicious attack can occur through a range of external and internal/insider threats. For example, damage may be caused by malware, hackers or disaffected personnel. Physical damage may be caused to:\n- IT equipment and sensors within the highway boundary\n- communications infrastructure or processing systems located outside the highway boundary (such as control centres, data centres, etc.)\n- logical damage to system software, operating systems and stored data or information\n- road users\n- These attacks can lead to loss of communications or network connectivity – and the corruption or loss of information and traffic disruption.\nTheft of equipment\nTheft of IT equipment, sensors or cables within the highway boundary can lead to loss of functionality or system resilience. It can also impact on the ability of the infrastructure system to perform as efficiently as it would otherwise. Repair and replacement can be disruptive and problematic.\nCyber-threats can arise in several ways including:\n- eCrime – such as the interference with road charging or toll systems, can lead to loss, or corruption, of data on charging, revenue or usage\n- loss of communications and power supplies – which can be accidental or due to deliberate damage to cables and/or distribution system components within the highway boundary or supplying systems outside. The impact will be reduced performance of the infrastructure\n- loss or corruption of software systems – which can impact on the system’s availability or integrity, leading to loss of functionality and/or loss or corruption of data."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c46d9f4b-56e8-474c-bb52-447e29d5774c>","<urn:uuid:b6075b45-b67f-4917-a717-ece1d197fa91>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What economic implications and security risks are associated with airline revenue management systems?","answer":"Airline revenue management systems have significant economic implications through their ability to implement sophisticated price discrimination strategies, such as charging 5% lower fares on weekends to target price-elastic leisure travelers. These systems have become progressively more sophisticated and are being adopted by other hospitality industries including hotels, rental cars, and cruise lines. However, these same systems face substantial security risks. They are frequent targets of cyberattacks, with credit card information and frequent flyer data being particularly vulnerable. For example, British Airways faced a $230 million fine after hackers stole credit card information from 380,000 passengers, while Cathay Pacific had personal information of 9.4 million passengers compromised, demonstrating the significant financial and reputational risks associated with these systems.","context":["تبعیض قیمت توسط جمعه بازار: شواهدی از صنعت هواپیمایی ایالات متحده\n|کد مقاله||سال انتشار||مقاله انگلیسی||ترجمه فارسی||تعداد کلمات|\n|18167||2012||12 صفحه PDF||سفارش دهید||9060 کلمه|\nPublisher : Elsevier - Science Direct (الزویر - ساینس دایرکت)\nJournal : Journal of Economic Behavior & Organization, Volume 84, Issue 3, December 2012, Pages 801–812\nThis paper identifies a source of price discrimination utilized by airlines – price discrimination based on the day-of-the-week that a ticket is purchased. Using unique transaction data, we compare tickets on the same airline and route that are purchased on different days of the week, after controlling for the day of week of travel, the ticket restrictions, the demand characteristics of the flights, and the number of days in advance that the ticket is purchased. We find that fares are 5% lower when purchased on the weekend. We conjecture that this is a form of price discrimination. If airlines believe that weekend purchasers are more likely to be price-elastic leisure travelers, then they may offer lower prices on weekends when the mix of purchasing customers makes demand more price elastic. This conjecture is supported by the finding that the weekend purchase effect is distinctly larger on routes with a mixture of both business and leisure customers than on routes that disproportionately serve leisure customers. We illustrate that this pricing practice can have important impacts on airline profits. These results have implications for other industries that have the ability to change prices daily based upon the types of customers who purchase on a specific day.\nIt is well-known that airlines use a variety of mechanisms to price discriminate between customers with different willingness to pay for travel. The existing theoretical and empirical literature has investigated several of these mechanisms including advance purchase restrictions, non-refundability, minimum stay requirements, and Saturday night stay requirements. Advance purchase restrictions can be used to segment consumers by their value of time (Gale and Holmes, 1993) and may be sold disproportionately to customers with low valuation (Dana, 1998). Tickets with Saturday night stay restrictions and other travel and refundability restrictions have lower fares, suggesting that ticket restrictions are used to price discriminate (Stavins, 2001 and Puller et al., 2009). However, the literature has not studied whether airlines segment customers by the day-of-week of purchase. In principle, this could be a valuable segmenting device. Travelers who purchase on the weekend (but travel any day of the week) may have different price elasticities than those who purchase during the week. Moreover, it would be very feasible to implement “day-of-week-of-purchase” pricing because airlines have the ability to dynamically change prices daily using sophisticated computer reservation systems. Current revenue management systems used by airlines allow revenue management analysts to reassess pricing daily during the booking process. 1 In this paper, we make a simple and straightforward contribution to the literature. We find that airlines charge lower fares for observably similar tickets based on the day-of-week of purchase, and that this phenomenon is consistent with price discrimination. This finding is important in its own right because airlines are increasingly using complex pricing schemes, and revenue management systems are becoming progressively more sophisticated. This analysis provides insights into the mechanisms of airline pricing. Our finding also has implications for a variety of other industries in which sophisticated pricing schemes can be applied. For example, the revenue management systems developed for airlines are being deployed in other hospitality industries including hotels, rental cars, cruise lines, and trains. And more generally, the study of price discrimination by time of purchase could have implications for e-commerce. The dynamic pricing of online retail markets could take advantage of changing prices based on the demand elasticities of consumers likely to be purchasing on any given day or specific times of the day. Although the general topic of intertemporal price discrimination has received considerable attention in the literature, this is the first paper to our knowledge to empirically investigate price discrimination based on day-of-week of purchase that is independent of the actual day of consumption. 2 One obstacle to identifying whether airlines price differently on specific days of the week is obtaining sufficiently detailed data in order to address various selection issues. For example, travelers purchasing on the weekend could pay less because they choose tickets with more restrictions or fly on less popular flights; such selection behavior could lead one to incorrectly conclude that airlines set different fares on weekends. One would need to control for a variety of ticket characteristics to accurately assess whether airlines price differently on weekends. The most common data used in existing airline pricing research – the U.S. Department of Transportation's Airline Origin and Destination Survey (DB1B) – do not include purchase or departure date nor ticket restrictions or load factors; thus, this dataset is not adequate to properly control for other factors that could affect pricing. Likewise, data on posted airfares gathered via web-scraping are not sufficient to address this issue unless the data contain flight times and ticket restrictions.3 We use a unique new dataset of ticket transactions to overcome many of these obstacles. Our data include individual ticket restrictions and information on the load factors of the itinerary's flights. We illustrate the general phenomenon of the weekend pricing effect in Fig. 1. This figure plots the mean fare paid by the day-of-week of purchase for a set of “restricted” tickets that involve travel on a weekday.4 Fares are distinctly lower when the ticket is purchased on Saturday or Sunday. This figure uses only a small subset of the controls that we use in the formal regressions. As we show below, even after controlling for a large set of ticket restrictions and load factors, tickets purchased on weekends are sold at fares that are 5% lower than fares purchased on weekdays. We interpret this finding as differential pricing of weekend purchases. Full-size image (29 K) Fig. 1. Motivating figure for a weekend purchase effect. Figure options We show that this empirical regularity is consistent with price discrimination. Routes with a larger share of business travelers are likely to have a different composition of passengers purchasing on weekends versus weekdays, creating incentives for airlines to lower fares on weekends when the demand is more price elastic. We find that the weekend purchase effect is 7% on routes that are a mix of business and leisure travelers while the effect is only 2% on routes that disproportionately serve leisure travelers. We argue that this is highly suggestive that airlines implement price discrimination by the day-of-week of purchase. In the final section, we show that the pricing strategy could have notable effects on airline profits. Our results differ from the only other paper that investigates a day of purchase effect in airlines. Mantin and Koo (2010) analyze a collection of fares from Farecast.com and find that, for a given route, average price is not affected by purchase day of the week but that price dispersion is higher Friday through Sunday. The differences between our findings and those of Mantin and Koo most likely arise from fundamental differences in the data. Mantin and Koo use posted online fares while we use transacted fares. Our data make it possible to account for factors not controlled for by Mantin and Koo, including ticket restrictions and flight-level load factors.\nنتیجه گیری انگلیسی\nThis paper investigates a robust empirical regularity that was not previously identified – the existence of a weekend purchase effect on airline ticket prices. Although we cannot definitively conclude that the effect reflects price discrimination, the cross-sectional variation in the size of the effect is certainly suggestive of a price discrimination mechanism. Moreover, simple calculations show that the pricing strategy could have notable effects on airline profits. These findings have implications beyond pricing in the airline industry. If the customer composition varies by day-of-week, such a pricing strategy could be utilized in other hospitality industries that use yield management software. Future research could test for day-of-week pricing in other hospitality industries such as hotels, car rentals, trains, and cruises. More generally, future research could test for similar pricing behavior in e-commerce in which prices can be adjusted by day of week (or even time of day) when customer composition is different.","Customer experience is paramount in an industry as competitive and prone to issues as air travel. To deliver a great experience, airports are innovating, from mobile apps to mood lighting and entertainment systems. An area that’s less visible to passengers is the activity monitoring and data collection airports conduct across a wide range of applications. This information is used to improve operations that impact every stage of the traveller experience. Even before passengers arrive at the airport, there are many ways applications are helping to make the experience more efficient, and as a result, more data than ever is being used to protect passenger privacy and keep departures on time. But, as well as the opportunities this creates, it’s also important to be aware of the cybersecurity risks.\nTicketing, frequent flyer miles, and personal data: access points for identity theft and fraud\nLooking at the recent experiences of some of the best-known airlines offers some valuable lessons. In 2018, British Airways announced that its systems had been hacked and the credit card information of roughly 380,000 passengers had been stolen. According to GDPR guidelines, the maximum penalty for a company hit with a data breach is a fine of either £17 million or four per cent of global turnover, whichever is greater. In this case, authorities intend to order British Airways to pay a fine of nearly $230 million for the breach.\nTwo months later, Cathay Pacific reported that the personal information of some 9.4 million passengers had been compromised — a collection of sensitive data that included passport and other identification numbers.\nAttacks like these have ripple effects beyond fines and public scrutiny: they impact customer confidence and brand reputation. That’s why data encryption and tokenisation technologies to protect critical customer information —such as credits cards, identification numbers and bank accounts — are now so important to keeping every aspect of the travel process more secure.\nBeyond credit card data, a growing black market for frequent flyer data is flourishing. Visitors to the ‘dark web’ can find hundreds of thousands of airline miles available at a fraction of the cost they would pay to airlines or credit card companies. Those ill-gotten miles can then be used to redeem gift cards or other points-based rewards – a simple form of illicit arbitrage. These miles can also be resold and put toward first-class upgrades and other bonus offers, according to Comparitech’s study into the black market for frequent flyer miles conducted last year.\nThat resale market has created a demand for bad actors to crack frequent flyer accounts. It’s also created a need for analytics to eliminate an unrelenting risk. For any application of this nature, software can be implemented that can spot behaviour-based anomalies — such as repeated password reset requests on the same account or login attempts from an odd location — to identify possibly illicit account access. Customers can then be alerted before the problem develops further.\nThat process starts with collecting data and tracking every incident, whether benign or threatening, and defining what constitutes normal account use. By leveraging machine learning and analytics, it’s possible to create a baseline of standard behaviour for the individual. This makes it easier to spot behaviours that fall outside that norm. Appropriate action can then be taken to stop the activity and build processes to address them.\nBaggage and luggage: Turning to analytics\nSeveral airlines have discovered baggage handlers that have checked an extra bag filled with rare and high-tariff goods into the system for an accomplice to collect at the destination. In such cases, neither the passenger, airport nor the airline are aware of the illegal use of identity and systems.\nNow that all appears to be on the brink of change: as of June 2018, the International Air Transport Association issued Resolution 753 requires that airlines track baggage at four key points: passenger handover to airline, loading to the aircraft, delivery to the transfer area and return to passenger.\nAirports and airlines are turning to data collection and analytics to solve this problem. Beyond tracking the location of a piece of luggage at a given time, analytics can spot unusual patterns, such as bags unexpectedly entering the system on loading or baggage handlers that stand out for baggage that is persistently misrouted — a sign that they may be using passenger bags to route illicit goods to an accomplice.\nIn the end, that means nothing gets on the plane that shouldn’t, which plays a significant role in keeping planes and passengers secure.\nRunways and perimeter breaches: Securing access to the plane\nBetween 2004 and 2015, there were 268 perimeter breaches at airports that handle three-quarters of U.S. commercial passenger traffic.\nFor example, there was the mentally ill man in L.A. who hopped the fence eight times in less than a year and twice reached stairs that led to jets. There was the man who threw his bike over a fence in Chicago, riding the bike across a runway and knocking on a terminal door. Then there was the man who drove an SUV through a security gate in Philadelphia and played chicken with a plane trying to land. In the UK, consumer drones entering the airspace of London Heathrow forced the entire airport to shut down.\nMuch of the protection required to prevent those breaches is physical, with additional barricades and security personnel on the ground. But there’s also the need to protect what’s on board because, in the modern airline industry, threats don’t always take a physical form.\nEvery month, there are 1,000 cyberattacks across the air transport industry. At the same time, just 35 per cent of airlines and 30 per cent of airports believe they are prepared to deal with cyber-threats today.\nBut, the same technology that is creating these new vulnerabilities is also being used to stay ahead of them. Machine learning, big data and analytics are all being used to gather data and set a baseline of normal behaviour, which makes threats and anomalous behaviour easier and faster to identify. Systems that can detect and escalate unusual patterns and help pinpoint event timelines provide deep insight on security events that may be the source of the anomalies. Gaining access to that insight before something happens is critical because it allows officials to stop problems before they start.\nIf something does come to pass, advanced tracking and analysis also facilitates a faster investigation — and ultimately find a faster way to resolution. The right tools can transform a process that typically takes weeks of searching through multiple months-worth of raw incident logs into one that takes only seconds — and presents a timeline for each security incident. And the faster you can find your way to the root cause of a problem, the quicker you can implement policies and procedures to prevent the same thing from happening again.\nPlanes, ageing fleets and controls: Securing the plane\nAnalytical insights are used every day to secure the plane from emerging and potential threats. In the past several years, a few examples of cybersecurity attacks on planes have surfaced.\nIn 2015, a cybersecurity consultant told the FBI he was able to successfully hack into an airplane’s computer system and force it to climb. Then, a year later, a Department of Homeland Security official remotely hacked the systems of an airplane parked at an airport in Atlantic City, N.J.\nWith a significant portion of every airline’s fleet made up of older airplanes, how do aircraft mechanics and maintenance teams track when those older systems are about to break or need to be tuned? At the same time, airplanes are coming onto the market with new bells and whistles, greater energy efficiency and their own unique vulnerabilities.\nSo how do we ensure both old and new airplanes are safe and secure? And how do we prevent cybersecurity attacks?\nThe answer, once again, lies in software.\nNewer planes can harness the power of data to spot red flags and identify possible security breaches as they’re happening. As standard procedure for newer planes, all flight data from a single flight is automatically downloaded when the aircraft is parked. This data will be used to gauge what’s happening in flight and pinpoint any anomalies in the plane’s functions. Airlines then run applications that log the files and use machine learning to analyse them for irregularities onboard and during the flight. Data collection and analysis ensure that problems don’t repeat themselves over time.\nFlying remains one of the most convenient and safest ways to travel. As the travel industry continues to provide better and more personalised experiences, analytics software will continue to drive innovation through the entire journey for passengers.\nOrion Cassetto, director product marketing, Exabeam"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5cde6a30-65c5-480a-9bc0-19efe0e9d380>","<urn:uuid:1c7739f1-e27f-4946-8c11-65ee2ad6cba2>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do Joshua trees and landbirds differ in their role as ecological indicators in desert ecosystems?","answer":"Joshua trees and landbirds serve as ecological indicators in different ways. Joshua trees are a keystone species in the Mojave desert with a specific mutualistic relationship with yucca moths for pollination and reproduction. In contrast, landbirds are considered good indicators due to their high body temperatures, rapid metabolisms, high trophic levels, and quick responses to resource condition changes. Additionally, landbirds are highly detectable and can be efficiently surveyed using standardized methods, while Joshua trees require more specialized study methods including genetic analysis and long-term population monitoring.","context":["Remember Joshua trees? If you read this blog, you probably do. They’re an ecological keystone species — and a cultural icon — in the Mojave desert, and they have a fascinating, co-evolving relationship with yucca moths. Some contributors to this very blog, have been studying that pollination relationship and its evolutionary consequences for a decade, building on natural history research that goes back to the time of Charles Darwin.\nUp to now, though, modern genetic tools have been of limited use for Joshua trees, because no one has assembled the complete DNA sequence of a Joshua tree. Having a “reference genome” would let those of us who study the trees identify specific genes involved in coevolution with yucca moths, compare the evolutionary effects of that pollination mutualism to natural selection exerted by the harsh environments in which the trees grow, and even use genome-scale data to inform Joshua tree conservation planning.\nWell, we’ve decided it’s time to do all of that, and we’re asking for help. A team of folks with expertise in Joshua trees’ natural history, Mojave Desert ecology, and genomic data analysis launched the Joshua Tree Genome Project a couple weeks ago, with a crowd-funding campaign on Experiment.com to pay for part of the DNA sequencing we’d need to assemble a reference genome.\nWe’re approaching 50% of our funding goal, and leading a competition among projects based at undergraduate universities to recruit the most donors, which could win us $2,000 in matching funds — so even if you give as little as $1, you’re providing a big boost to the project.

It’s mainly geared toward showcasing how Willamette undergraduate students participate in the fieldwork, but I’d say it makes the desert look mighty good, too.\nOne of your future colleagues in the Smith Lab, hard at work in the field.\nFriend of the blog—and longtime collaborator of mine—Chris Smith recently landed an NSF CAREER grant for new research on the causes of evolutionary divergence within the Joshua tree-yucca moth mutualism—and he’s looking for a postdoc to help with it!\nThe proposed work will take advantage of new genomic resources for the genus Yucca—Joshua tree population genetics is about to get a lot more powerful than the 10 microsatellite loci I used for my dissertation research. And it will involve fieldwork in the Mojave Desert, which is objectively one of the most beautiful empty spaces on the map of North America. Chris is on the faculty of Willamette University, which is an undergraduate institution, so the postdoc position is also a unique opportunity to do basic research in close coordination with an undergraduate teaching program.\nMoreover, I can personally recommend Chris as a mentor and collaborator—to the extent that I’ve turned out to be a pretty decent scientist, he’s one of the principal reasons why. (And to the extent that I haven’t, well, that’s a reflection on me, not him.)\nThe complete job description, and instructions on how to apply, are after the jump.\nA Joshua tree flower, up close.\nA huge diversity of flowering plants rely on animals to carry pollen from one flower to another, ensuring healthy, more genetically diverse offpsring. These animal-pollinated species are in a somewhat unique position, from an evolutionary perspective: they can become reproductively isolated, and to form new species, as a result of evolutionary or ecological change in an entirely different species.\nEvolutionary biologists have had good reason to think that pollinators often play a role in the formation of new plant species since at least the middle of the 20th century, when Verne Grant observed that animal-pollinated plant species are more likely to differ in their floral characteristics than plants that move pollen around via wind. More recently, biologists have gone as far as to dissect the genetic basis of traits that determine which pollinator species are attracted to a flower—and thus, which flowers can trade pollen.\nHowever, while it’s very well established that pollinators can maintain isolation between plant populations, we have much less evidence that interactions with pollinators help to create that isolation in the first place. One likely candidate for such pollinator-mediated speciation is Joshua tree, the iconic plant of the Mojave Desert.\nEvery Friday at Nothing in Biology Makes Sense! our contributors pass around links to new scientific results, or science-y news, or videos of adorable wildlife, that they’re most likely to bring up while waiting in line for a latte.\nWhich Coauthor are you?

It’s work I enjoy, but it doesn’t often give me an excuse to interact directly with the study organism, much less get outdoors. So, when Chris Smith dropped the hint that he could use an extra pair of hands for fieldwork in the Nevada desert this spring, I didn’t need a lot of persuasion.\nChris is continuing a program of research he started back when he was a postdoc at the University of Idaho, and which I contributed to as part of my doctoral dissertation work. The central question of that research is, can interactions between two species help to create new biological diversity? And the specific species we’ve been looking at all these years are Joshua trees and the moths that pollinate them.\nJoshua trees, the spiky icon of the Mojave desert, are exclusively pollinated by yucca moths, which lay their eggs in Joshua tree flowers, and whose larvae eat developing Joshua tree seeds. It’s a very simple, interdependent interaction—the trees only reproduce with the assistance of the moths, and the moths can’t raise larvae without Joshua tree flowers. So it’s particularly interesting that there are two species of these highly specialized moths, and they are found on Joshua trees that look … different. Some Joshua trees are tall and tree-ish, and some Joshua trees are shorter and bushy. Maybe more importantly for the moths, their flowers look different, too.\nWhite gypsum sands: officially an ecological opportunity\nEvidently they’re not willing to toot their own horns, so I’ll do it on their behalf: Two of our contributors, Simone Des Roches and Chris Smith, have brand-new publications in print, and both papers are open access, available to anyone who wants to take a look.\nSimone’s paper makes the case that the gypsum sands of White Sands, New Mexico, create an “ecological release” for lizards living there, since reduced predator density and diversity on the white dunes lets the lizards use a wider range of habitat types, and achieve higher population density.\nFirst, we provide evidence for ecological opportunity by demonstrating reduced species richness and abundance of potential competitors and predators at White Sands relative to nearby dark soils habitats. Second, we characterize ecological release at White Sands by demonstrating density compensation in the three White Sands lizard species and expanded resource use in White Sands Sceloporus undulatus.\nChris’s paper tests the hypothesis that Joshua trees have expanded their range northward since the last glacial maximum, drawing together many different data sets to find the same signal of population expansion.\nUsing a database of >5000 GPS records for Joshua trees, and multi-locus DNA sequence data from the Joshua tree and four species of yucca moth, we combined paleaodistribution modeling with coalescent-based analyses of demographic and phylgeographic history. We extensively evaluated the power of our methods to infer past population size and distributional changes by evaluating the effect of different inference procedures on our results, comparing our palaeodistribution models to Pleistocene-aged packrat midden records, and simulating DNA sequence data under a variety of alternative demographic histories.","Landbird Monitoring in the Southern Plains, Sonoran Desert, and Chihuahuan Desert\nLandbirds are one of many natural resources monitored by the National Park Service (NPS) Division of Inventory & Monitoring (I&M). Landbirds are considered good indicators of ecosystem health for many reasons. In NPS units of the American Southwest, three I&M networks monitor landbirds using the scientific protocol described here.\nLandbirds are a conspicuous component of many ecosystems. Because they have high body temperatures, rapid metabolisms, occupy high trophic levels, and can respond quickly to changes in resource conditions, landbirds are considered good indicators of ecosystem health. In addition, landbirds are highly detectable relative to other vertebrates, and they can be efficiently surveyed with the use of several standardized methods.\nLandbirds are also protected under the legal mandates of the Endangered Species Act (1973) and Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Monitoring changes in landbird population and community parameters can be an important component of any comprehensive, long-term monitoring program.\nFor these reasons and because they are specifically identified in the management objectives of many network parks, the National Park Service’s Southern Plains, Sonoran Desert, and Chihuahuan Desert Inventory and Monitoring Networks have chosen landbirds as a focus for long-term natural resources monitoring. To gain operational efficiencies and improve the spatial and thematic scope of our results, the three networks conduct monitoring in an integrated, collaborative fashion, in partnership with the Rocky Mountain Bird Observatory.\nSpecific, measurable objectives for landbirds monitoring are:\nTo estimate the proportion of points occupied for most species in most parks. Occupancy is a measure of presence or absence of a species in space. This measure, when evaluated across time, indicates changes in the distribution of a species.\nTo estimate parameters related to community dynamics—particularly species richness and composition, which are essential to understanding the effects of changing landscapes and management practices on native biodiversity. Using community-level estimators is an efficient means of obtaining meaningful landbird data within our operational constraints.\nTo estimate density of the most common species using the point-transect distance-sampling method at fixed points. Where assumptions are met, density estimates can provide a robust and widely accepted method for estimating bird abundance. For larger parks, we will likely be able to estimate density for only the most common species, due to time and other constraints on field efforts.\nThe researchers developed an aerial survey method specifically for counting sea otters and estimating abundance and distribution. Aerial surveys were conducted annually.\nFrom vessels and from the shore, the researchers observed thousands of sea otter foraging dives and recorded information on foraging success and efficiency based on prey numbers, types and sizes obtained, and time expended.\nBenthic invertebrates, such as clams, urchins, crabs, and snails, were collected by divers, measured, and returned to the seafloor. This study compared the fauna of intertidal and subtidal habitats before and after their re-occupation by sea otters.\nProducts, Scope, and Schedule\nNetwork-scale status and trends reports and park-specific landbird resource briefs are produced annually. Appropriate assessments of potential trends requires several years of data, so early reports focus on current status and species composition.

{"question":"How large is the Great Ball Court at Chichen Itza and when was it dedicated?","answer":"The Great Ball Court at Chichen Itza measures 545 by 223 feet (166 x 68 meters), making it the largest ball court in Mesoamerica. It was dedicated in 864 AD.","context":["This is an expanded collection of photos taken on our day in Chichen Itza. In this gallery I will share photos as I created them and offer added information prior to the photo in most cases.\nEntering the Zona under the gaze of El Castillo\nLocated in the center of the Great Plaza stands the Temple of Kukulkan, also referred to as El Castillo (the castle in Spanish). Dedicated to the feathered serpent god Quetzalcoatl, this is easily the most famous landmark of Chichén Itzá. The pyramid rises 79 feet (24 meters) above the plaza, plus an additional 20 feet (6 meters) for the temple on top. The base of the pyramid is 181 feet (55.3 meters) on each side. El Castillo represents the Snake Mountain, a mystic place in Maya folklore where creation first occurred. Snake Mountain is a design practice adopted in Teotihuican as well as the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan. At Chichen Itza the design is brought to its full artistic maturity.\nPerhaps the most iconic of Mayan pyramids, the Temple of Kulkulkan (the Feathered Serpent) was built over a recently discovered cave and cenote. (Read more here.) I appreciated the recent restrictions prohibiting people climbing on the structures, and practiced patience throughout the day to get the cleanest shots of the ruins that I could.\nGroup of the Thousand Columns & Temple of the Warriors\nThe Temple of the Warriors is a large stepped pyramid that was named after the surrounding carved columns depicting warriors. This temple is similar to Temple B at the Toltec capital of Tula. The one at Chichen Itza, however is much larger. The Temple of Warriors is approached by a broad stairway with a plain, stepped ramp on either side, each ramp has figures of standard-bearers to hold flags. At the top of the stairway on the temple’s summit sits Chac Mool, a statue depicting a reclining figure supporting itself on its elbows with a bowl or a disk upon its stomach.\nAlong the south wall of the Temple of Warriors are a series of about 200 columns, prompting the name Plaza of a Thousand Columns. When Chichen Itza was inhabited these would have supported an extensive roof system. The columns are in three distinct sections: a west group, that extends the lines of the front of the Temple of Warriors; a north group, which runs along the south wall of the Temple of Warriors and contains pillars with carvings of soldiers in bas-relief; and a northeast group, which apparently formed a small temple at the southeast corner of the Temple of Warriors.\nIn and around the Venus Platform and Tzompantli\nThe Ball Court\nChichen Itza contain no less than 13 ball courts, but the Great Ball Court is by far the most impressive. At 545 by 223 feet (166 x 68 meter) it is the largest ball court in Mesoamerica. The ball court has an I-shaped playing ground and a small temple at either end. To the north stands the North Temple or Temple of the Bearded Man, a small masonry building with detailed bas-relief carvings on the inner walls, including a center figure that has carving under his chin that resembles facial hair. At the south end stand another, much bigger temple, but in ruins.\nThe Great Ball Court was dedicated in 864 AD and is radically different than any other Mayan ball court, which are smaller and have sloping sided courts. The two vertical walls of the Great Ball Court are 39 feet high (12 meter) high with ringscarved with intertwining serpents in the center of each wall. Both walls are carved with scenes showing teams of ball players. One panel shows a headless player kneeling with blood shooting from his neck, while another player holds the head.\nThe Sacred Cenote\nThe Sacred Cenote is a sinkhole that is connected to Chichen Itza by a raised pathway. This large natural well may have given Chichén Itzá (“Well of the Itzáes”) its name. There is a second karst cave in the center of Chichén Itzá that was used as a source of water for Chichén Itzá’s residents. The use of the Sacred Cenote was exclusively ceremonial. Over the years, the murky water has yielded many artifacts including gold, jade, copper, turquoise, obsidian, copal or incense, pottery, rubber, shells and the bones of around 200 people who were thrown in as a sacrifice.\nThe Tomb of the High Priest is also known as the Ossuary or Osario, meaning burial place.\nReflecting the styles of El Castillo, the Tomb of the High Priest has a combined elements of both Toltec and Puuc influences. The pyramid stands ten meters (30 feet) high and has four staircases leading up to the top temple. Carved feathered serpents adorn the sides if the stairwells and the pillars also reflect the serpent-God. It has stucco reliefs of mythological characters.\nIn between the two pillars is an entry port 10 meters (36 feet) down via a cut stone shaft to a natural cave. When it was excavated, numerous bones and funeral offerings were found at the cave; shell, copper bells, jade.\nThe Red House\nThe Red House is also known as the House of Little Holes; the name was attributed to the holes in the latticework on the roof comb on the top of the structure.\nCalled the Red House because it contained the famous Mayan red colors when discovered, it is located in a plaza with the House of the Deer and House of Grinding Stones. It rests on a 5 Meter high platform and has simple lines and three Chac masks on the roof comb. Hieroglyphs in one chamber mention rulers of Chichén Itza and Ek’Balam and an inscribed date relating to 869 AD. Some describe blood- letting and other ceremonies.\nVery new hieroglyphs reveal the structure was built around AD 800 and 850. It was probably a residential building for the elite.\nA small ball court was restored on the structures back wall.\nTemple of the Deer\nBuilt in the Terminal Classic Period, the House of the Deer is a badly damaged building showing only a small fraction of its former glory.It was named for the carving of a deer found inside the house when it was first explored. That carving has long since been lost but the name has endured. The buildings consist of three chambers and an alter to the front face. It is 53 feet (16 meters) high including platform and chambers. It is a simple structure with a plain façade. The undecorated roof comb is only partially standing. The House of the Deer was likely a civic or religious structure but certainly with less stature than many of the other ceremonial buildings at Chichen Itza.\nThe El Caracol “observatory” stands as a monument not only to the architectural skill of the ancient Mayans but also to their surprisingly advanced understanding of the heavens. El Caracol, which means “snail” in Spanish is named after the winding staircase that rounds the interior of the central tower. Dating to around 906 AD, the crumbling viewing tower stands on a large square platform high above its surroundings. From the tower the Mayans could view the sky above the vegetation without any obstruction.\nThe Nunnery complex is the largest structure in what is called the Late Classic zone (600-950 A.D.), which preceded the Toltec takeover of Chichen Itza. However it also shows some influence of later residence. The building itself is of the Chenes style, which is a local Yucatan style. The main part of the Nunnery consists of a series of vaulted rooms seated on a 33 foot (10 meter) high platform mound. Some of the rooms were abundantly decorated with mural paintings and stone mosaics in the late Puuc style. The doorway lintels have well-preserved carved hieroglyphs referring events that took place around 880 A.D. Later on, another small construction was added as a third floor, completely built in the Maya-Toltec style, for which many Puuc decorated pieces were reused.\nThe name of the Nunnery (Las Monjas in Spanish) comes from the erroneous interpretation of the first Spanish visitors who, upon seeing the large number of rooms, were reminded of the cells of a monastery. Most archaeologists now believe it was a palace for Maya royalty.\nThis small building with only one chamber owes its name to its proximity to the so-called “convent” of the Nunnery and to the exuberant decoration on its upper facade, which rises even higher due to its lofty roofcomb. One can observe large areas covered with the original stucco on the Grecian frets of the central panel. Chaac is represented repeatedly on the panels. Up to now, it is not known what the function of this building was, and in spite of the overloaded decoration of the building, it is one of the best architectural examples of the Puuc style in Chichen Itza\nAnd of course the daily reward for a day well spent in the hot: a dip in the cool. A bit overcrowded and developed, but well worth the slalom. Everything you need to know about Ik-kil found in Cenotes of Mexico.\nI would like to give credit where credit it due. I have borrowed information from several sites including: ChichenItzaRuins.org and MexicoArcheology.com as well as plaques provided on site at Chichen Itza."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:d1505b10-bd3e-4bb8-af5a-e6df905e1956>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the similarities between Open Automation's collaborative features and Microservices' architectural approach to system integration?","answer":"Both systems emphasize interconnected components working together, but through different mechanisms. Open Automation Platforms facilitate collaborative workflows by breaking down traditional silos between departments and enabling cross-functional collaboration in real-time.

The keyword “open automation platform” represents not just a technological shift but a strategic move towards a more integrated and responsive industrial ecosystem.\nTop of Form","Thoughts by: Sven Bernhardt, Richard Attemeyer, Torsten Winterberg, Stefan Kühnlein, Stefan Scheidt\nA frequently discussed topic these days is the Micorservices architectural paradigm. Discussions on various internet blogs and forums are showing the trend that proponents of this approach are not tired of emphasizing why Microservices are different to a holistic SOA approach, when dealing with breaking up or avoiding monolithic software architectures.\nFor this reason it’s time for the Cattle Crew team, to take a closer look on this arising architectural style and the corresponding discussions from a different perspective.\nAmongst others Martin Fowler published a blog about what is characteristic for Microservices and applications build on the foundation of this architectural style . According to this and other blog posts (see also , ), the goal of a Microservices approach is to avoid software systems to become monolithic, inflexible and hardly manageable, by splitting a system into modular, lightweight and maximum cohesive services. Applications build on this architecture should ensure the agility regarding changes caused by changed business requirements, because affected services of an application can simply be adapted and be redeployed independently from other components.\nEffectively a Microservice is a in itself cohesive, atomic application, which fulfills a dedicated purpose. Therefore it encapsulates all needed elements, e.g. UIs, logic components, may also have its own separated persistent store and may run in a separate JVM, to ensure as less impairment to other services as possible. Furthermore the implementation technologies for a specific service may vary. For each service the best-fitting technology should be used; there should be no restrictions regarding the used technologies.\nTo ensure consistency as well as compatibility with already existing components in case of changes and to guarantee seamless release management of changed components, a Continuous Delivery procedure is indispensable for succeeding. In addition the implementation efficiency benefits from the Microservices approach, because different components may be developed in parallel. Communication between the services, if needed, is done via lightweight protocols such as HTTP. Well defined interfaces are depicting the service contracts.\nWhere there is light, there is also shadow…\nOne of the basic questions, we asked ourselves when discussing the Microservices approach, is how to determine respectively which metrics to use for evaluating, if a service is a Micorservice or not. Resulting from that it would be interesting what if it is no longer a Microservice: is it directly a monolithic service?\nA clear definition about what are the differentiating and unique characteristics of a Microservice cannot be found. Metrics like lines of code or number of classes are no appropriate characteristics, so something spongy, like specific business functionality has to be taken as a distinctive mark for a real Microservice. But that’s not really measureable…\nBesides the missing clarification about the Microservice term as such, building business applications using a modular Microservices architecture means a higher complexity than when using a classical monolithic approach. From conception to delivery to the operating this higher complexity may raise the following challenges:\n- Right level of service granularity; not too coarse grained, not too fine-grained\n- Comprehensible service distribution for scalability reasons and the corresponding monitoring\n- Complex testing procedures because of loose coupling and service distribution\n- Consistent and tolerant Error-handling, because a referenced service might be down for maintenance reasons (Timeouts, Retry mechanisms, etc.)\n- Reliable message delivery\n- Consistent transaction handling, because of cross-service communications using non-transactional protocols like HTTP mean the establishment of complex compensation mechanisms\n- Guarantee of data synchronization and consistency, when services have their own and exclusive persistent stores\n- Sophisticated Service Lifecycle Management, because every service has its own lifecycle including challenges like how to deal with incompatible interface changes\nAnother risk we see with a naive implementation of the Micorservices architecture is a fall-back to the days of distributed objects: Calling a magnitude of services is not a good idea because of latency and (missing) stability.\nMicroservices and SOA\nWhen dealing with the Microservices approach it is conspicuous that at least one paragraph could often be found, stating something like “Microservices vs. SOA”, where it is depicted that Microservices and SOA are conceptually different. In this context the idea of SOA is often reduced to technology terms like WS* or ESB and therefore referred to as heavyweights. This definition of SOA only covers possible implementation details, because from a conceptual perspective SOA is also an architectural paradigm, making no premises regarding implementation details or the corresponding technologies to use for a concrete SOA implementation.\nWhen looking at the sections before, describing Microservices-based architectures and its challenges, it can be stated that very similar concepts and challenges arise in SOA-style architectures, because characteristics for Service-oriented architectures are loose-coupling, standard-based and stable service contracts, distributed services and flexibility as well as agility regarding changing business requirements. The resulting challenges are nearly the same. As a reason for this, in our opinion the both approaches aren’t so different essentially.\nSOA-style architectures historically often use SOAP-style communications. But regarding this fact we are observing a change: the number REST-style SOA services is growing. A trend which is mainly influenced by the increasing need of multi-channel support, e.g. for mobile devices, where REST-style communications by using a JSON-based data format is the preferred variant. The big software vendors, e.g. Oracle, also recognize this trend and therefore have extended out-of-the-box support for REST services.\nIn system architectures that are based on the SOA paradigm, an ESB is often used to integrate different enterprise applications. Classically it cares about routings, protocol as well as data transformations and service virtualization. So point-to-point integrations between systems can be avoided and makes an IT system landscape more flexible regarding adding new applications as well as services. In our opinion this can’t be called heavyweight and is indispensable for increasing agility.\nFurthermore the microservices proponents do not say any word about service governance. This is also ok for some sorts of SOA services. We often differentiate services into public and private services. Systems consisting of multiple components are often organized as a set of collaborating private services . These interfaces are not published enterprise-wide and must therefore not adhere to more strict policies applied to public services. The offical / public interfaces of a system are in contrast published as public services.\nThus from our perspectives, Microservices are nothing new, but rather an implementation of the concept of private services.\nMicroservices architectures are primarily focusing on a local, application-based scope and provide a very flexible as well as modular approach for developing easy-to-extend applications. In summary it can be said that the Microservices architectural paradigm seams to deliver great benefits though it must be stated that the approach is not a completely new concept. Compared to that a SOA approach has a farsighted, global scope aiming at the enterprise level. From a SOA perspective, Microservices could be understood as private services, not necessarily exposing their functionalities for reusing them in other systems or services. But that is ok, because in service-oriented architectures one does not expose a service, when there is no need – which means no need for reuse in other applications or services – for it.\nTaking all points discussed in this article into account, we would recommend that discussions about differences between Microservices and SOA should be avoided. Instead it should be evaluated how and if a coexistence of these two very similar approaches is possible to deliver the most valuable benefit for system architectures as possible, making IT system landscapes more flexible and therefore promoting business agility."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e3b3e2a7-5fd6-4524-a979-0aa4422557d2>","<urn:uuid:b8e0e007-8359-439e-929e-672362e007a8>"],"error":null}

{"question":"How do the New Year celebrations differ between Ratha Saptami in India and Songkran in Thailand in terms of their water-related rituals?","answer":"Both festivals involve water rituals but with different purposes and styles. During Ratha Saptami, devotees perform 'Arghyadan' by offering water to the Sun God using copper Kalash while standing and chanting mantras. In contrast, during Songkran, people throw water at each other using containers, water guns, or garden hoses, and also gently pour fragrant water over Buddha images in monasteries for good luck. Ratha Saptami's water ritual is a more solemn religious offering to one deity, while Songkran's water activities have evolved into widespread celebratory splashing, though it also retains religious significance through the ritual cleansing of Buddha images.","context":["Click the 'Play' button to read out loud this webpage content\nRatha Saptami is an important day in Hinduism, which is celebrated as a festival. The festivity happens on the Saptami or the 7th day during the Shukla Paksha in the month of \"Magha\" as per the Hindu calendar.\nThis way, Ratha Saptami falls on the next day of Shri Panchami or Vasant Panchami. The day celebrates Sun God, and hence it is also known as Surya Jayanti or Magh Jayanti; it happens in Magha month. This is considered the birthday of the Lord Sun, which people celebrate to show gratitude toward the Sun that enlightens the whole world and makes life possible in the universe.\nOn the day of Saptami, Lord Sun is worshipped who sits on a golden chariot driven by seven white horses. This image denotes the glory of the Sun, which is not just limited to Earth but in heaven and the entire universe too.\nThere are many temples built to honor Lord Sun to praise him through gratitude. On this day, all these temples are decorated; special events and celebrations happen. People visit the sun temples; they thank the Lord for giving them light and energy, and they worship God. Several big temples like Tirumala Tirupati Balaji arrange special pujas and adornments for Sun, and it is majorly celebrated in Indian states like Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh.\nTaking a bath on this day holds unique significance. Hence people wake up early in the morning and take a holy bath. The bath taken at the time of Sunrise is considered auspicious on this day. It is also considered to remove all the ailments and negativity while blessing the individual with good health and life. For this reason, the day is also known as \"Arogya Saptami.\" In Tamil Nadu, people use Erukku leaves in their bath to make it more sacred.\nOnce the devotees take a bath, they offer \"Arghyadan\" to Sun. During this, they offer water to Sun, slowly using a small Kalash. This is done by facing the Sun in standing position; people use copper Kalash for the offering. They chant Surya Mantra while offering the water; some people also chant twelve different names of Sun.\nOnce they have performed the water rituals, they worship the Lord Sun. For this, devotees light up a Ghee Diya and circle it in front of the Sun. They then offer red flowers by sprinkling in the direction of Sun. They light up some Kapoor and dhoop batti too. It is a belief that doing so blesses the devotee with the Sun's blessings, and he gets bestowed with a long and healthy life along with success.\nWomen of the household welcome and show gratitude to Lord Sun by drawing the image of Surya with the chariot. They make rangolis in front of their house as a welcome gesture. They then boil the milk in their courtyard in a mud vessel that faces the Sun. This boiled milk is then used to make the sweet rice to offer the Lord Sun.\nChanting Surya Mantra or Gayatri Mantra is considered very auspicious on this day.\nIn Hinduism, Sun is considered God who provides us with light and energy that makes life possible on Earth. Since the Ratha Saptami is considered the Sun's birthday, worshiping him on the day brings blessings of the Sun in one's life. In Hinduism, Sun is also a giver of long life, good health, a positive mind, and success. Hence worshipping Sun on a specific day sanctifies the devotee with all these aspects; plus, it also helps in flushing away his sins committed in the lifetime, so he gets a better life in the next birth and the current birth.\nThe day of Ratha Saptami also denotes the movement of the Sun in the northern hemisphere. The Winter ends, and the Summer season starts; this is also an indication of a rising temperature that is more notable in India's Southern states. The occasion signifies the beginning of the harvesting season too. The farmers harvest their crops and express gratitude to Sun God Surya and nature for providing them the right environment to let the crops grow. This is also the beginning of the New Year in some places.\nThe sacred scriptures prescribe fire ceremony, Abishekam (hydration ceremony), Pooja/Archana (Light and Sound ceremony), Yantra and Mantra (special sounds) as the ways to offer your prayer to the divine. Out of these, fire ceremony is the most evolved spiritual technology on earth to connect with the divine beings. Participate in the remedial services to clear your karma and receive the blessings.","\"The Songkran festival (Thai: สงกรานต์, Khmer: សង្រ្កាន្ត; from the Sanskrit wordsaṃkrānti, or literally \"astrological passage\") is celebrated in Thailand as the traditional New Year's Day from 13 to 15 April. It coincides with the New Year of many calendars ofSouth and Southeast Asia.\nThe date of the festival was originally set by astrological calculation, but it is now fixed. If these days fall on a weekend, the missed days off are taken on the weekdays immediately following. Songkran falls in the hottest time of the year in Thailand, at the end of the dry season. Until 1888 the Thai New Year was the beginning of the year in Thailand; thereafter 1 April was used until 1940. 1 January is now the beginning of the year. The traditional Thai New Year has been a national holiday since then.\nSongkran has traditionally been celebrated as the New Year for many centuries, and is believed to have been adapted from an Indian festival. It is now observed nationwide, even in the far south. However, the most famous Songkran celebrations are still in the northern city of Chiang Mai, where it continues for six days and even longer. It has also become a party for foreigners and an additional reason for many to visit Thailand for immersion in another culture.\"\nThis celebration entails a ceremonial blessing by sprinkling of water. Over the years, it has evolved into almost prankish levels. So if someone hits you with a water balloon or dumps an entire bucket of water on you and runs for cover, you'll know why.\n\"The most obvious celebration of Songkran is the throwing of water. Thais roam the streets with containers of water or water guns (sometimes mixed with mentholated talc), or post themselves at the side of roads with a garden hose and drench each other and passersby. This, however, was not always the main activity of this festival. Songkran was traditionally a time to visit and pay respects to elders, including family members, friends, neighbors, and monks.\nBesides the throwing of water, people celebrating Songkran as a Buddhist festival may also go to a wat (Buddhist monastery) to pray and give food to monks. They may also cleanse Buddhaimages from household shrines as well as Buddha images at monasteries by gently pouring water mixed with a Thai fragrance (Thai: น้ำอบไทย) over them. It is believed that doing this will bring good luck and prosperity for the New Year. In many cities, such as Chiang Mai, the Buddha images from all of the city's important monasteries are paraded through the streets so that people can toss water at them, ritually 'bathing' the images, as they pass by on ornately decorated floats. In northern Thailand, people may carry handfuls of sand to their neighborhood monastery in order to recompense the dirt that they have carried away on their feet during the rest of the year. The sand is then sculpted into stupa-shaped piles and decorated with colorful flags.\nSome people make New Year resolutions - to refrain from bad behavior, or to do good things. Songkran is a time for cleaning and renewal. Besides washing household Buddha images, many Thais also take this opportunity to give their home a thorough cleaning.\"\nSo if you never got to that New Year's resolution, go ahead and make it now. :) Better late than never."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4f631de3-4148-424b-9d1c-49cd75f2f654>","<urn:uuid:136d7786-fbd4-47fa-95a6-55787346cf1a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are required distances from power lines during excavation work, and what financial penalties apply for violations?","answer":"OSHA standards require excavators to maintain a minimum distance of 10 feet from energized power lines during operation. Violation of this safety requirement can result in substantial fines, as demonstrated by a case where a contractor received a willful violation citation with a $56,000 fine for operating within this limit. Additional serious violations related to shock hazards and improper excavator placement resulted in $6,600 in fines, bringing total penalties to $62,600. Beyond OSHA fines, utility strikes can also incur costs of around $10,000 per hour for service disruption to clients.","context":["I (William Sheppard) was a Safety professional in heavy civil construction for over 10 years, and in that time I investigated numerous incidents of breaking functioning underground utilities. Not once did anyone get hurt or die. What are odds of dying from a utility strike, you ask? The odds of being fatally injured are one in five, for those incidents with an injury. Those aren’t good odds, so if you have hit a utility four times during your career, do not hit another.\nUnder every city and town in the state and, yes, below our lakes and rivers, run utility lines, tunnels and other structures. If you hit them some can kill you, and all will cost you. You will encounter hidden hazards that kill the striker quickly: gas, propane and electricity. In addition, you may also encounter those that may kill others: telephone and communication cables and national defense lines. Many people are unaware of these hazards. Some who are aware do not respect the danger of underground utilities.\nAnyone in Oklahoma can dial 811 or use the OKIE811 online service to notify utilities so they can “mark out” their underground facilities. Always remember, you must call for these utilities to get marked, whether you are constructing a new drive way, or driving posts for a new fence, etc. The OKIE811 system is free, it is easy, and it’s the law.\n- You must call regardless of where the excavation is located. Even if it’s on private property, out in the middle of a field, or on a street with no name – “You must Call.”\n- You must call if you are only excavating a few inches or just surface grading. If you move material – “You must Call.”\nEach year, approximately 700,000 underground utilities are struck during excavation work, according to the Common Ground Alliance, a group that provides training and education on underground hazards as well as coordinating the “OKIE811 – Call Before You Dig System.” If you’re lucky and no one is fatally injured, the cost of one utility strike may result in serious financial losses. Additional costs can be fines levied by the utility that can no longer provide service to its clients. These fees can range around $10,000 per hour for loss of service. If you shut down a hospital or stop work at a factory, you will likely pay for their losses too.\nIt has been my professional experience there are two steps that can help eliminate and reduce excavating hazards - verifying and documenting utility mark out. Here are some tips to help you, the excavator, work safely and save your municipality money:\nUpon arrival at the worksite, prior to beginning the excavation, an excavator should do the following:\n- Verify that the worksite matches the OKIE811 one-call request and is timely\n- Verify that all facilities have been marked and review the color codes if in doubt\n- Verify all service feeds from buildings and homes near the worksite\n- Check for any visible signs of underground facilities, such as pedestals, risers, meters and new trench lines\n- Check for any facilities that are not members of the one call center and contact someone to get them located\nIt is important for excavators and locators to document the location of markings before excavation work begins. The primary purpose of this best practice is to avoid unnecessary litigation and expensive legal fees for all parties involved. Additionally, documenting marks is an excellent idea, as marks will be covered by spoils or degraded by weather and construction equipment and there could be, if not caught during the mark-out verification process, mismarked utilities. In most situations when underground facilities are not properly marked, excavators have no way of knowing where underground utilities are located. If located markings are adequately documented through the use of photographs, video, or sketches before excavation work begins, it is easier to resolve disputes if an underground facility is damaged as a result of improper marking, failure to mark, or markings that have been moved, removed, or covered. Make sure to capture documentation (measurements) of marks in relation to permanent landmarks like large rocks, utility poles, pedestals, gates, fences and buildings.","ELECTROCUTION DEATH LEADS TO $62,600 IN FINES AGAINST CONTRACTOR\nBOSTON -- The electrocution death of a worker who came in contact with energized power lines at a Blackstone, Mass., sewer installation project has resulted in $62,600 in proposed fines against his employer. The U.S. Labor Department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration has cited ODF Contractors, of Dorchester, Mass., for alleged willful and serious violations of the Occupational Safety and Health Act following the July 5 accident. The worker was standing in the elevated bucket of an excavator attempting to tie together overhead wiring when the arm of the excavator contacted an energized power line, killing him instantly. \"The inspection found that the excavator was operating within 10 feet of energized lines, a clear violation of OSHA standards with which this employer was certainly familiar,\" said Ronald E. Morin, OSHA area director for Central Massachusetts. \"As a result, we have issued a willful citation for failing to maintain a safe distance from the lines and proposed a fine of $56,000 for that hazard.\" A willful violation is defined by OSHA as one committed with an intentional disregard of, or plain indifference to, the requirements of the Occupational Safety and Health Act and regulations. Three serious citations, totaling $6,600 in fines, were also issued. Two are for allegedly exposing employees to serious shock hazards by allowing the worker to use the excavator bucket without first deenergizing the power lines and for lack of ground fault protection for employees using a submersible pump to remove water from a trench. The third citation is for placing the excavator at the edge of an excavation, into which it could fall in the event of a collapse of the trench's walls. OSHA issues a serious citation when there is a substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result from the cited condition, and the employer knew, or should have known, of the hazard. ODF Contractors has 15 working days from receipt of its citations and proposed penalties to either elect to comply with them, to request and participate in an informal conference with the OSHA area director, or to contest them before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. The inspection was conducted by OSHA's Springfield, Mass., area office.

{"question":"How does linguistic bias affect archaeological research publication, and what are the main themes in Roman sculpture studies?","answer":"Linguistic bias significantly impacts archaeological publication, as papers lacking native English writing style may be perceived as having substandard research, leading to lower acceptance rates from non-Anglophone countries. This creates barriers for sharing important findings. Regarding Roman sculpture studies, three main themes emerge: contextualization of finds within cities' topographic and social landscapes, construction of identity and cultural memory (especially during the Second Sophistic period), and analysis of production modes, trade, and workshop relationships. These themes are studied across major sites in Asia Minor, though language barriers may limit their international dissemination.","context":["Bryn Mawr Classical Review 2012.06.37\nFrancesco D'Andria, Ilaria Romeo (ed.), Roman Sculpture in Asia Minor. Proceedings of the International Conference to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Italian excavations at Hierapolis in Phrygia, held on May 24-26, 2007, in Cavallino (Lecce). JRA Supplementary series, 80. Portsmouth, RI: Journal of Roman Archaeology, 2011. Pp. 384. ISBN 9781887829809. $149.00.\nReviewed by Esen Öğüş, Texas Tech University (email@example.com)\nThis is a multilingual volume of 25 papers presented at the conference on ‘Roman Sculpture in Asia Minor’ held in 2007 to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the Italian excavations at Hierapolis, Phrygia. As stated in the very brief Preface by the editors, this book intends to complement the Hierapolis volumes published in recent years by the Missione Archeologica Italiana at Hierapolis (MAIER) and by Ege Yayınları in Istanbul (p. 7). The volume is indeed a welcome contribution for understanding the recent finds, problems, and methods of interpreting the sculpture of Hierapolis and other major sites in Asia Minor.\nThe presentations are organized in six sections. The first, ‘Roman sculpture in Asia Minor: the state of the art,’ comprises three articles by Koch, Bejor and Pensabene that deal with key questions about production and schools of sculpture. The following four sections group essays not according to subject matter, but according to the sites that they discuss. They are: Aphrodisias (Smith, Chaisemartin, Roueché), Ephesos (Aurenhammer, Auinger, Rathmayr), and Hierapolis (D’Andria, Ritti, Romeo, Zaccharia Ruggiu and Canazza, Rossignani and Sacchi, Yıldız, Pellino). The fourth section, titled ‘Other Sites,’ deals with Nysa (Strocka), Ilion (Rose), Lagina (Söğüt), Perge (Bravi), Sagalassos (Mägele), Laodikeia (Şimşek) and Pergamon (Mania). The final section is devoted to ‘late antiquity’ (Kiilerich, Sperti). Due to space restrictions, the present review will not deal with all the articles individually, but only with some specific points.\nFirst of all, the Preface is too short (only five paragraphs) and is largely devoted to thanking various institutions and sponsors that made the conference possible. Although it states the three major themes handled in the book (see below), a more comprehensive introductory chapter by the editors might have addressed significant issues, such as the aims of this gathering, the choice of sites and especially of invited scholars, what results were gained from the encounter, and what new finds or methods of investigation it produced.\nThe second point that deserves mention is that the site-based division of the articles, although seemingly well organized, does not necessarily reflect the three important themes addressed in the book. As stated in the Preface, one of these themes is the “contextualization of the sculptural finds within the topographic and social landscapes of cities such as Aphrodisias, Ephesus, Hierapolis, Ilion, Laodikeia, Pergamon, Perge, and Sagalassos” (p. 7). Examining sculptural material within its cultural, social, historical and archaeological context is indeed a popular trend that promotes viewing the objects through the eyes of their contemporaries. Auinger, for example, compares the sculptural decoration from the Vedius and the East gymnasium baths in Ephesus. Based on reconstructions of fragments in their context, she concludes that the so-called Kaisersaal halls were used as an encomium to the benefactors. Mägele, likewise, examines the sculpture of Sagalassos in its urban context, in particular the three monumental nymphaea and their sculptural assemblages. Similarly, other authors demonstrate the usefulness of considering epigraphic and literary context in interpreting statuary. Ritti delves into the relationship between art and text at Hierapolis, while Roueché investigates the ancient response to statues by discussing text and graffiti not only at Aphrodisias, but also at other sites, particularly Ephesus.\nThe second leitmotif in the book is the construction of identity and cultural memory in statuary within the cultural context and the complex web of power relationships in Asia Minor. Among the many articles in this category, D’Andria’s paper on the sculptural decoration of the nymphaea in Hierapolis examines how the scenes of Amazonomachy and images of the Gods aimed to evoke cultural memory and myth within the broader background of the Second Sophistic. Similarly, Romeo investigates the civic identity expressed by the iconography of the ‘Beautiful Tomb,’ a monumental heroon at Hierapolis. Rose focuses on sculpture and coinage at Roman Ilion to demonstrate the evident link of the Roman site with its Bronze Age antecedent in the visual record, and the complex relationship of the imperial family with Ilion’s past. Bravi, on the other hand, examines the reflection of panhellenism and cultural memory in the public spaces at Perge, particularly the Hellenistic towers and the city gate, and the north nymphaeum.\nThe third theme in the book concerns the modes of production, trade, technical aspects of the workshop, and the existence of workshops and their relationship with each other. Under this category, Bejor’s article on the ‘schools’ and ‘workshops’ poses significant questions regarding the definition and distinction of these terms while reviewing current literature on the topic. Pensabene focuses on the ‘schools’ of Dokimeion, Aphrodisias and Nicomedia, while Smith’s essay concentrates on the visual and epigraphic evidence regarding sculptural workshops at Aphrodisias. Koch’s paper on the state of research on Roman imperial sarcophagi in Asia Minor deserves special mention. It raises several critical questions that await further analysis in the field of sarcophagus studies, such as the practice of producing imitations of Attic sarcophagi in local workshops, or where Dokimeion sculptors were located after the workshops ended production. An expanded and illustrated version of this article, happily for students of Roman sarcophagi, was recently published in a bilingual book (German and Turkish).1\nThe essays in the book were written by a good mix of well-known and accomplished scholars with less well-known or new names in academia. Such combination is a welcome and positive aspect of the book, which adds to the richness of the collection. This applies also to the choice of subject matter, which unites new material with reappraisal of previously published items. However, greater consistency would have been desirable as well, in terms of both the scholars’ contribution and the content and coverage of the material. While some papers hit key points in the overall thinking and methodology of understanding the sculptural material, others are no more than descriptive accounts that rely on basic, though careful, formal analysis.\nOf the 25 articles in the volume, 11 are in English, 10 are in Italian, 3 are in German, and 1 is in French. Since the volume was published by a prominent American publisher, this reviewer would have preferred to have English abstracts for each paper, both in order to appeal to a larger audience in the Anglophone world, and for quick reference to the articles’ contents. The print quality is high, consistent with the rest of the JRA supplementary volumes. Some of the drawings and plans are more meticulously and accurately prepared than others, but are, in general, satisfactory.\nOverall, the book is a welcome and commendable addition to the recent scholarship on the sculpture of Asia Minor, which in general receives less attention than sculpture in Italy or Greece. The reader will not only learn about recent finds and scholarly research, but also about recent methods of interpreting the material.\n1. Koch, G. 2010.

However, the dominance of the English language especially in the most prestigious academic journals, poses a different barrier to researchers who do not have high quality English writing skills. In this post Sneha Kulkarni discusses how the rise of English as the ‘lingua franca’ of science poses challenges for effective research communication and suggests how the research community might act collectively to address these issues.\n“How difficult it must be to reach a “eureka” moment but feel that the words are inadequate to describe it; what a challenge it is to articulate ideas in a language not your own.” – Boer Deng in an article for Slate.\nIf you are a researcher, you are most likely familiar with the pressure to publish in international journals. But when it comes to non-native English speakers, the added challenge of writing papers in a language they lack proficiency in, only increases this pressure. To some, this problem may appear to be a minor one. However, if good research fails to find its way to publication – the barrier being the language – ultimately it is a loss for science.\nToday, English is the lingua franca of global science. Its dominance in international scholarship is apparent from the fact that most researchers would not consider publishing their best work in any other language but English. As Nicholas Subtirelu observed, publishing in an “international” journal by default now refers to an English-language journal.\nHowever, this situation is a relatively recent development. Up to the mid-twentieth century, German and French arguably had a similar status across a range of disciplines to English. The most influential works of Albert Einstein for instance, were published in German. Whilst the dominance of English has been noted before, the issue has a new salience now, as an increasingly large share of global research comes from non-English speaking countries. Notably, in 2018, China surpassed the USA to become the largest producer of scientific articles. As research has become increasingly globalized, the challenge of how to deal with English as a barrier to engagement with the scientific community has remained.\nThis barrier is very real for authors who lack the vocabulary to present in English the findings they have worked for years to arrive at. In a large-scale survey report that Editage released in 2018, about 76% of over 7000 researchers (mainly from South Korea, China, Japan, and Brazil) reported experiencing moderate to extreme difficulty in writing in English. As one participant remarked:\n“It is too hard for a young researcher […] to write a English paper for submission to international journals. It is enough hard in English to pass a peer review… I am not good at writing English, it is too difficult to write, it takes time, and I cannot judge my English paper is good or not.”\nCertainly, it is not enough to have breakthrough findings unless they are reported comprehensibly. But when a paper’s fate hinges on how sound it is grammatically and linguistically, rather than its merit, one can imagine the additional burden it places on authors who are not proficient in English. This is only exacerbated by the fact that a number of high profile journals indicate in their instructions for authors that a poorly written research paper can be rejected.\nAnother major ramification of the pressure to publish research in English is the impact it is having on research cultures outside of science. As Mary Jane Curry and Theresa Lillis argue, the pressure to publish in prestigious English language journals is now increasingly being felt in the social sciences and humanities. With the result that the best highly contextual research in these fields is, not only becoming more difficult to access for regional researchers, but is also being isolated from the local communities and institutions that might benefit from their findings.\nThere is also evidence for significant linguistic bias when journals receive a manuscript written in poor English, in which papers lacking a native English writing style create an impression that the research they discuss is also sub-standard. This may account in part for the comparatively low acceptance rate that has been reported for papers that come from non-Anglophone countries. It also suggests that again high-quality research findings never see the light of day because they are obscured by poor language.\nSo what can be done to empower non-native English-speaking authors?\n“For authors who are non-English-native and resident in non-English speaking world, too much cost is taken in time and money, in spite of the importance of publishing papers in English. […] For this, many researchers are giving up submitting papers to English journals, even if they are doing excellent studies,” asserted one of the researchers who participated in the Editage survey.\nIf examples such as these are to be avoided, responsibility falls on the stakeholders across the academic publishing industry to address this issue collectively. To start with, the challenges of authors who struggle to write in English should be acknowledged. Policymakers should assist authors to become better writers by offering aid for academic writing courses. Universities and colleges should also include scientific or academic writing as part of their curriculum. As Scott L. Montgomery, author of the book Does Science Need a Global Language? English and the Future of Research, suggests, scientific training for non-native English researchers should be “handled as a normal and necessary skill, like mathematics.”\nTranslation can also play a role in bridging the language gap by making a greater share of the best global research available to a wider audience. While English has become the lingua franca of science, important research continues to be published in other languages. Many journals, however, refrain from publishing translated versions of papers due to the time and cost involved. Identifying the benefits of making research available to a wider audience, journals should take advantage of the availability of new technologies that can help streamline the publication process and reduce the cost of publishing translated papers.\nJournal editors and reviewers should also shoulder responsibility for eliminating bias directed toward authors with imperfect English writing skills. Keeping an open mind when evaluating papers with poor English and assessing a manuscript beyond the parameters of language could go a long way in this regard. Understandably, journals are swamped with submissions, and it would be unfair to expect editors and peer reviewers to spend time processing incomprehensible manuscripts. It is certainly heartening, therefore, that many publishers now encourage authors to get their manuscripts edited for language before submission.\nResearchers lie at the core of this community that is dedicated to creating and disseminating knowledge for the benefit of society. To enable them to pursue their work and excel in it, the research culture needs to be more inclusive. Taking into account the problems that non-native English authors face when writing in English, peers and journal editors should extend a helping hand to ensure that these authors are empowered. The boundaries created by language can only truly be transcended with the recognition and collective action of the scientific community.\nAbout the author\nSneha Kulkarni is Managing Editor, Editage Insights, Editage, Cactus Communications.

{"question":"How do chaos theory and random walks both demonstrate the delicate balance between stability and unpredictability in living systems?","answer":"Both concepts demonstrate that living systems require a precise balance between order and disorder. In random walks, like card shuffling, there is a phase transition phenomenon where the system abruptly shifts from an ordered state to a uniform distribution after a certain threshold. Similarly, in chaotic systems like the three-body problem, too much chaos prevents systems from developing, while too little leads to stagnation. Living things exist in a narrow, fertile region between these extremes where just enough disturbance maintains healthy functioning, whether in heart rhythms or population dynamics. This reflects life's fundamental nature as a dynamic process rather than a static equilibrium, where feedback and conflict are constant yet manageable within certain bounds.","context":["Michael Chapman loves to solve riddles and logic puzzles. This passion was one of the catalysts for him to pursue a mathematical career. As a doctoral student at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in Israel, Chapman became an expert in group theory, the mathematical study of symmetry, and its various connections to theoretical computer science. For example, he studied the dynamics of random walks on groups, a field that examines, among other things, how many shuffles are needed for a deck of cards to be properly ‘mixed.’ In more recent explorations, Chapman has focused on property testing problems in groups and their relation to approximation theory of algebraic structures.\nChapman is a second-year Junior Fellow with the Simons Society of Fellows. He has a postdoctoral appointment at New York University’s Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences under the mentorship of Subhash Khot and Oded Regev. We recently spoke about his current work and doctoral achievements, as well as the general mathematical concepts that guide his work today.\nOur conversation has been edited for clarity.\nYour academic interests include combinatorics, group theory and probability. How do these fields relate to one another?\nOne could — and many do — study each of these topics separately. But even when these topics are studied together, that combination takes various forms. Combinatorics is the study of discrete — often finite — objects, such as graphs (in the sense of a network of nodes and the connections between them). Group theory focuses on the symmetries of an object. For example, a square has eight symmetries, while a circle has infinitely many. In mathematics, finite collections of symmetries are both ‘group theoretic’ and ‘combinatorial’ in their nature and can thus be studied through the lenses of both fields.\nAn interesting thing about symmetries is that they can either commute or not commute with one another. In this case, a pair of symmetries commute with one another if the order in which you apply them provides the same result.\nFor example, let’s say you have a clock with its hand pointing to 12. You then rotate the clock 90 degrees clockwise and then reflect it through its (vertical) middle. The hand will now point to 9. But if you first reflect and then rotate, you get a different outcome: The hand will now point to 3. This means that, for the clock, not all symmetries commute with one another.\nProbability theory is the rigorous study of random events, and this is a point in which it can enter the scene: Given two randomly chosen symmetries, what is the likelihood of them commuting? Another interesting random event is the following: Let’s say I start flipping a coin again and again. Each time it comes up heads, I rotate my clock by 90 degrees. But each time it comes up tails, I reflect the clock through its middle. What would be the expected position of the hand of the clock after, say, 500 coin flips? This second type of problem, in which you randomly apply symmetries on an object and study the expected behavior, was the focus of one of my doctoral projects. These processes are called random walks or drunken walks because you can view them as traveling in a random (or unsober) way on a graph of symmetries.\nTell us more about that.\nShuffling a deck of cards is an example of the application of a symmetry to the deck. When you shuffle a deck of cards, your goal is to end up with a scenario in which every ordering of the cards is equally likely. So, the longer you shuffle, you’d expect to get closer and closer to this ideal uniform distribution of all orderings. This is true, but surprisingly, the transition from being far from uniform to being close to uniform occurs abruptly.\nThis is similar to the physics phenomenon of phase transition. Water is a liquid between 0 and 100 degrees Celsius, which is a vast temperature range. But if you cool the water from 1 degree Celsius to –1 degrees — a change of just two degrees — it turns to ice, a substantial change of global behavior.\nThe same happens with shuffling. There is a long period during shuffling whereby the resulting deck is still very reminiscent of the original ordering. But, by applying only a few extra shuffles, the cards reach their ideal uniform distribution of all orderings. In the study of random walks, this temporal phase transition phenomenon is known as ‘cutoff.’\nI study the cutoff phenomenon in various naturally occurring random walks.\nHow does this work relate to theoretical computer science?\nRandom walks appear throughout theoretical computer science. So, the examples I described above are already on the cusp of mathematics and computer science. But my focus on computer science comes from a different angle. Further into my doctorate, I started studying property testing problems in the context of group theory. These are the kinds of problems that are still my main interest today.\nA property tester is a fast, randomized algorithm with the goal of deciding whether a big object, which the tester does not have time to examine thoroughly, satisfies a certain property. For example, say you want to group all Instagram users into 200 sets, such that no users of the same set follow each other. If this can be done, we would say that Instagram is ‘200-colorable.’ Determining whether this is indeed the case requires an immense amount of computing resources. But there is a simpler way: Sample a small, random portion of the people on Instagram, analyze who follows who, and then declare a verdict for all of Instagram according to this local view.\nClearly, we cannot use this method to deduce with certainty that Instagram is 200-colorable. However, we may construct our fast random process such that the further Instagram is from being 200-colorable, the higher the chance that this process would spot this uncolorability property.\nIt turns out that finding good property testers for certain properties of function between groups has far-reaching applications — both theoretical and practical. The fields of probabilistically checkable proofs in computer science, as well as approximation theory of algebraic structures, are closely tied to such questions. In my recent work with Oren Becker, we studied a generalized version of the linearity, or homomorphism, test of Blum–Luby–Rubinfeld for amenable groups, and proved that, in this more general setup, it is a good tester.\nA homomorphism is a structure-preserving map between groups, and it is an essential building block in the theory of groups. Currently, I study more efficient candidate testers for verifying that a function is close to being a homomorphism. Inspired by the MIP*=RE breakthrough in quantum information theory, my collaborators and I recently devised complexity classes that are connected to big open problems in pure mathematics, such as the Aldous–Lyons conjecture. The hope is that a better understanding of these complexity classes may resolve these problems in pure math.\nFinally, what are your thoughts about the Simons Junior Fellowship?\nWhen I was getting my doctorate, I had many colleagues who were around my age. We socialized a lot, and generally shared in the struggles and triumphs of working through a Ph.D.\nNow I am older, with a wife and two young daughters. I generally socialize much less. Also, postdoc life tends to be a bit more individualistic. For all these reasons, the Simons Society of Fellows community has been most welcome. I have found genuine friends that will hopefully keep being part of my life in years to come.\nI also enjoy learning about what happens in science in general, and the Simons Society of Fellows enables me to do that. I love attending the foundation’s weekly Presidential Lectures, and relish the countless opportunities I have to chat informally with other Junior Fellows, whether about their work, my work, or the lecture we just attended. Overall, it has been a truly enlightening experience.","Pan Books 1999\nKeywords : artificial life - artificial life research - information - life is all about insuring information is passed on while at the same time preventing entropy from corrupting the message - ALife is showing how the dynamics of information can come to dominate over the properties of the material living things are made of - phase space - Chris Langton -\n...the continuum of living organism stretches from viruses, which are little more than a stretch of DNA or RNA surrounded by a protein sheath, up to planetary ecosystems like earth at the other. All the use the same principles to defy the first and second laws of thermodynamics and the attempts of the larger universe to return them to the dust from whence they came.\nArtificial life research encompasses software simulations, robotics, protein electronics and even attempts to recreate the Earth's first living organism. It is less concerned with what something is built of than with how it lives. It is concerned with dynamics and just how life keeps going. All you, I and everything else need is information.\n... Life keeps going using information. The relationship between information and entropy was first discovered by Claude Shannon, an engineer who worked at Bell Laboratories in New Jersey during the 40ies. Shannon is investigating what prevents information being transmitted across a channel or telephoneline. He found that fault lay with the hard to define quality that all this seemed to be increasing whenever information was lost. Shanon never witnessed a decrease in this quality in all the experiments he performed. He called this slippery quality entropy.\nLife is all about insuring information is passed on, or transmitted, while at the same time preventing entropy from corrupting the message. Life has found a way to ensure that entropy keeps increasing but not that the expense of its own survival or the integrity of the information it wants to transmit.\nThis is the biggest and best tricks that life has learned. Now ALife is helping us to understand just how it does it. It is starting to show that living things do not rely on the properties of chemicals to foster another generation, they depend on information encoded in chemical form. ALife is showing how the dynamics of information can come to dominate over the properties of the material living things are made of.\nTHE THREE BODY PROBLEM\n...ALife research has revealed that this shift occurs when the system is acting chaotically. Chaos in the mathematical sense. In the real world stability seems to reign. The seasons come and go, our heart keeps on beating and the taps keep dripping but in truth nothing is as safe or secure as it first appears. Living things cannot be captured by equations, they are too messy for that. Intuitively we feel that we have more in common with clouds than clocks and Chaos helps explain why.\nPredicting the movement and interaction of two bodies as they orbit the sun is relatively straightforward. Newton solved the mathematics of this problem. You could be forgiven for thinking the mathematics would not get much more complicated if a third body were added. In fact the addition of another object creates an intractable computation known as the n-body problem. The mutual interaction of three bodies around a gravitational centre makes their exact movement impossible to predict. Only in the last decade have researchers been able to use Chaos mathematics to confirm that this is the case. The implication is that the same is true of any system where remarkable forces and influences are at work.\nThis interplay of objects and forces plays two roles. It keeps the system unpredictable, constantly threatening to upset the apparent equilibrium and plunge it into chaos, but that the same time the push-me-pull-you play of forces keeps it on the straight and narrow. ... The best that can be done is map out all possible outcomes and watch the subject move around the territory to get the feeling for what forces are at work and how they are weighed against each other. These 3-dimensional behavioural maps can be plotted on computer and are said to exist in phase space. You can think of it as a place where anything can happen.\nWhat is becoming apparent is that life has to exist on a knife edge. Observation of fish populations and ant colonies, as well as experiments with artificial creatures, have shown that too much chaos produces a system that never gets a chance to settle down and develop. But if there is too little stimulation, everything stagnates. Between these extremes is a narrow, fertile region where just enough disturbance gets through to keep our heart beating healthily or a populations thriving.\nLIFE AS A DYNAMIC PROCESS\n... this conception of life as a dynamic process - rather than an inherent property of the bits and pieces that living organisms are made of - has only recently begun to prevail. Prior to this change in perception life and living systems were fault by ecologists and biologists to be working toward a static state where environment and organism work in a equilibrium. Now it is known that feedback and conflict is the norm, with specious constantly wrestling for the upper hand and managing to survive and develop together as a result.\nThis method works because of the realisation that the essential properties of life can be abstracted away from the bustling life we find on earth. In constructing computer models of living things we lose nothing because life is all about the preservation of an abstract property - information. ALife pioneer Chris Langton says: \"...the \"artificial\" in Artificial Life refers to the component parts, not the emergent processes. If the component parts are implemented correctly, the process they support are genuine - every bit as genuine as the natural processes they imitate. The big claim is that a properly organised set of artificial primitives carrying out the same functional roles as the biomolecules in natural living systems will support the process that will be \"alive\" in the same way that natural organisms are alive. Artificial life will therefore be genuine life - it will simply be made of different stuff that the life that has evolved here on earth.\"\nHOME BOE SAL TEXTE"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7924cca1-af81-4e64-89af-3a10aaa03af1>","<urn:uuid:46ec1179-b0ec-4a19-be37-5a3a4ae6447c>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do header tags and canonical tags compare in their impact on website navigation? 🔍","answer":"Header tags (H1-H6) and canonical tags serve different navigational purposes. Header tags shape the content structure of your website, with H1 being the main title and H2-H6 forming subsequent sub-headings, which improves readability and user experience. Canonical tags, however, specify to search engines which version of a URL should be considered the master copy when multiple similar URLs exist (like https://www.samplesite.com and www.samplesite.com), helping search engines navigate and index your site more effectively by avoiding duplicate content.","context":["Was this article helpful?\nThanks for your feedback\nSearch Engine Optimization (SEO) improves your website’s ranking on Search Engine Results Page (SERP). An exceptional SEO strategy can attract customer traffic and provide growth in revenue and sales. Let us look at some of the SEO best practices that you can implement with Contentstack to improve your site’s visibility on a search engine.\nMeta description and title tags provide a brief introduction to your website. This introductory content comes up on a SERP when a customer’s search criteria match keywords in your website’s metadata.\nTitle tags and meta descriptions are pieces of HTML code placed within the <header> tag of a web page.\nLet us look at how you can assign appropriate meta description and title tags to your webpage with Contentstack.\nWhile defining the structure of your Contentstack website, perform the following steps:\nAdditional Resource: Want to know more about content types? Check out the Create Content Types section that has a set of guides that has all the details that you need to know.\nThis will make sure you have relevant metadata in place when you decide to publish content to your website.\nPerform the following steps to add SEO related tags to your website code:\n<meta name=\"title\" content=\"an appropriate title for your website content\">\nThis code assigns a title to your meta tag.\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"appropriate description for your website content.\">\nThis code assigns description details to your <meta> tag.\nThis code will make sure that the necessary SEO calls fetch and display appropriate metadata on your website.\nDisplaying images is the best way to explain a certain feature of your company’s software. The images provide a direct view of the steps being performed while a user makes use of that particular feature.\nThe “alt” (short for “alternate”) text appears in place of an image on a website if the image fails to load on a user's screen. Sometimes, this alternate text helps provide information about an image while the image loads on the screen. This helps improve SEO ranking as search engines find it easy to crawl the web and visit your website’s links.\nContentstack also uses alt text to provide information about the images uploaded to our website. Follow the below steps to add “alt” text to images within Contentstack:\nIf you happen to change the URL of an already-published entry, it is highly advised that you redirect the previous URL to the newer one. This is considered as an appropriate SEO best practice as users trying to visit the older link to the website will be automatically taken to the newer link, instead of seeing a “Page not found” error.\nAdditional Resource: We have a detailed, step-by-step guide on Redirecting URLs that you can refer to, for more details.\nLet’s see what you need to do to manage URL redirects for your Contentstack-powered websites.\nYou need to create a separate content type to manage the redirection of the changed URLs.\nIf you change the URL of any published entry, create an entry for your Redirect content type.\nNow, if any user visits the old URL, he/she will be redirected to the new URL automatically.\nBroken links can affect your website in the following ways:\nAdditional Resource: Contentstack uses Xenu for finding broken links on the website. This tool is available online and you can download it for free. It connects to your website and checks for broken links by crawling through webpages just like any search engine would.\nA canonical tag specifies to the search engine that a particular URL is actually a master copy of a specific page. This tag indicates which version of a specific URL should be displayed in the search results that a search engine derives.\nUsing the canonical tag helps avoid duplicate content being placed on multiple URLs. This helps the search engine easily crawl the Web and pick out the URL you have mentioned in the canonical tag to browse through your website. Easy navigation enables better SEO rankings.\nLet us consider a sample website which can be reached through all of the following links:\nA search engine will consider every single one of these URLs as a unique webpage. However, they are five similar copies of the homepage. Here, setting a canonical tag that points to a specific URL (e.g. https://www.samplesite.com) will tell the search engine to include just that URL in the search results.\nWhen setting up the code for your website on Contentstack, add the following line of code inside the header tag in HTML:\n<link rel=\"canonical\" href=\"your preferred website address\">\nYou can add the version of your website address that needs to be displayed on the search results page here.\nA sitemap provides a list of all the important URLs that exist on your website. The sitemap forms a roadmap that Google’s search engine can follow to crawl to a particular URL link on your website.\nThe use of sitemap benefits organizations that have websites:\nBy providing a list of all the important webpages on a sitemap, you indicate to a search engine that these are appropriate landing pages on your website. The sitemap then provides an easily accessible index for the search engine to intelligently traverse through your website. This provides better on-site SEO.\nYou can use service providers such as Google’s online XML sitemap generator service to make use of sitemaps with Contentstack. These sitemaps are normally stored within a file named sitemap-index.xml.\nYou can also create a plugin that autogenerates the sitemap-index.xml file when a particular entry on your Contentstack website is published.\nHigh-quality content attracts search engines and visitors to your website. Visitors prefer crisp and engaging content that sticks to the main topic that your website is all about. Users are able to find relevant content and may end up visiting related sections of your site too.\nContent that promotes good onsite-SEO should contain the following attributes:\nWhen search engines can easily crawl to a particular website URL, onsite-SEO rankings improve. Search engine friendly URLs provide users with an appropriate path to their desired destination.\nLet us see how URLs can be optimized for SEO.\nIt is a good practice to include keywords that tell crawlers what the webpage is about in the URL. When you include the most relevant term alongside the root domain of the website URL, this helps search engines direct the right traffic to your site.\nConsider a website with the URL https://example.com/headlesscms. Here, the keyword headlesscms specifies what the webpage is about.\nAn SEO-friendly URL should flow logically from the root domain to categories and sub-categories. This hierarchy will allow search engines and users to crawl through your website with ease.\nConsider the following URLs:\nThe first URL is SEO-friendly as it provides smooth flow towards the CMS. While the second URL confuses users with its inappropriate categorization.\nHere are a few more practices that help maintain SEO-friendly URLs on your website:\nIt is a good practice to optimize the header tags on your website for better user experience and onsite-SEO. Use of SEO-friendly headlines makes your content easier to browse through and improves SEO ranking for your website.\nLet us take a look at some best practices to be followed while using header tags for your website.\nAn H1 tag provides the largest headline available on your webpage. This tag usually represents the title of your webpage or other significant content that should stand out from the remaining data on the webpage.\nIt is considered as a best practice to use only one H1 tag for your webpage as more than one titles would confuse visitors that scan through your website.\nFor example, the Contentstack website follows the same ideology on its webpage. The webpage maintains “Industry Leader in Headless CMS” as the sole H1 tag, providing better readability for its visitors.\nUse of a single header tag enhances user experience and improves SEO rankings for the website.\nThe header tags shape the content on your website and provide appropriate context for the data present on your webpage. To provide appropriate flow of information on your website, you can use different header tags to structure your content.\nLet us take a look at the different types of header tags:\nFor example, the H1 tag would form the title of your blog post, while the tags ranging from H2 to H6 would form the subsequent sub-headings inside your blog post.\nThe “Robots.txt” file is a text file that indicates to search engines which webpages on the website to crawl and which not to crawl. Before a search engine visits a site, it will first go through the “Robots.txt” file for directions.\nLet’s consider the following basic content block that lies within the “Robots.txt” file:\nUser-agent: * Disallow: /\nHere, the asterisk refers to all the search engines or visitors that crawl the website while the slash indicates to the visitors that they should avoid visiting that particular website.\nAny search engine that crawls your website will crawl through all the webpages displayed on your website. However, crawling through so many webpages can take a lot of time and affect SEO rankings for your website.\nThis negative ranking depends on the crawl budget that Googlebot assigns to your website. The crawl budget represents the number of URLs on your website that Googlebot decides to crawl through.\nNow, this is where the “Robots.txt” file comes in handy. To help Googlebot or any other search engine crawl the most important webpages on your website, you can mention the important URLs within the “Robots.txt” file. This helps improve SEO rankings for your website.\nLet’s consider a scenario where we have placed content for a particular blog post within the Contentstack CMS. Here, we have placed the content, however, it is supposed to be published to the website at a later time.\nTo avoid the blog getting published at an earlier time, the developer includes the link for this blog post within the “Robots.txt” file. This means that the blog post entry will be skipped whenever any other content is sent for publishing.\nWas this article helpful?\nThanks for your feedback","HTML Codes Cheat Sheet\nThis page contains a list of up-to-date HTML tags / codes, complete with comments and mini video tutorials - just click on the corresponding links to launch the video.\nThis page is a work in progress ... now 40 minutes of free of videos.\nWebsites you may want to check out:\nWeb design basics video tutorial: Beginners Web Design\nBeginner's tutorial on web design: www.how-to-build-websites.com.\n|GENERAL COMMENTS: These tags are the foundation of a web page, and as such they must be included in every page.||Video|\n|<!DOCTYPE ...||The doctype 'tells' the browser how to read and interpret the HTML (markup*) code.||Video|\n|<html> ... </html>||Creates the HTML page|\n|<head> ... </head>|\n|<title> ... </title>||Sets the page title|\n|<body> ... </body>||What you see on the page falls between these tags|\n|About 'markup' :||Web pages can be written in either HTML or XHTML ... both are 'markup' languages.|\nGENERAL COMMENTS: Keeping with the goal of 'real-world-web design', this page of HTML CODES starts with the tags that are by far the most often used.\nNote: keep in mind that most tags work in pairs - that is to say, they have an opening tag and a closing tag.

{"question":"What is difference between using long and short tethers on a sailboat deck?","answer":"Long tethers (6 feet) are primarily used in the cockpit and allow standing up, but if you fall overboard with a long tether at high speeds, you risk being bashed against the hull while in water. Short tethers (3 feet or one-meter) are safer when moving forward on deck as they prevent you from hitting the water completely, though they require crawling along the deck. Using a double tether system allows switching between lengths as needed.","context":["Activities The Great Outdoors How to Use Jacklines Share PINTEREST Email Print The Great Outdoors Sailing Gear Navigation & Seamanship Types of Sailboats Hiking Climbing Skiing Snowboarding Surfing Paddling Fishing Scuba Diving & Snorkeling Learn More By Tom Lochhaas Tom Lochhaas is an experienced sailor who has developed several boating safety books with the American Red Cross and the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary. our editorial process Tom Lochhaas Updated June 24, 2019 01 of 03 What Is a Jackline? Photo © Tom Lochhaas. A jackline is a line or strap used 0n a sailboat to help keep you on the boat. Typically a jackline is run from the stern to the bow on both sides of the boat. A sailor wearing a safety harness uses a tether to connect to the jackline when moving along the deck of the boat. Having one continuous jackline from stern to bow makes it easy and safe to stay clipped on the whole time when moving forward to the bow from the cockpit. Shown here is a commercially available jackline coiled before use. Typically sailors stow jacklines away until needed or until taking the boat offshore, when it’s a good idea to have jacklines in place so that they’re ready when needed. When purchasing a jackline, get one about the length of your boat. Typically a jackline runs from a strong cleat at the bow to one on the stern—one on each side. 02 of 03 Jackline Secured to Bow Anchor Cleat Photo © Tom Lochhaas. This boat has a heavy cleat near the bow on each side. This photo shows the view back from the bow of a jackline running down the deck toward the stern. The line is tied to an aft cleat using a cleat hitch. Notice that this jackline is a heavy strap, not a round line. It is important to use a flat strap rather than a round rope. If you step on a round line, the line may roll and cause you to lose your footing. If you make your own jacklines rather than purchasing them, keep in mind that the standard is at least 5000 lbs. breaking strength. This may seem excessive, but a person thrown across the deck by a big wave may strain a line with well over a thousand pounds of force. 03 of 03 Safety Tether Clipped to Jackline Photo © Tom Lochhaas. With the jackline in place, you simply clip onto to it with the shackle on the end of the tether hooked to your harness. As you move along the deck in either direction, the tether simply slides along the jackline. With a well-positioned jackline, you can clip on for safety before leaving the harness and attend to any business on deck without having to unclip. Safety Issue vs Personal Preference? Since most tethers are 6 feet long, a sailor who is thrown overboard while tethered to a jackline will likely go into the water but not with head immersed. Sailors who have had this happen while the boat is moving very fast in a high wind have described the plight of being bashed around in the water and against the hull until the crew can stop the boat and hoist them back aboard. Some sailors, therefore, prefer to use the 3-foot length of a double tether to clip on and crawl forward along the deck—the shorter tether should prevent you from hitting the water at all. With a double tether, you can always switch to the 6-foot tether when necessary to stand up at the bow. Read more about other Sailing Safety topics.","Some simple steps can reduce the risk of a crew overboard incident.\n- Keep low and use one-meter tether going forward. Double tether when working. Sit down. Some days the only smart way to move forward of the mast is to scoot.\n- The long tether may be used in cockpit, but only rarely on deck.\n- The decks are thinner; every attachment requires a backing plate to spread the load.\n- With outboard-powered boats, the tether must never reach past the transom. Propellers kill.\n- Run the jacklines well inboard when possible.\n- Stop jacklines 4 feet short of front edge of tramps or front beam; the greatest MOB risk is a sudden stop when the boat slams into a wave.\n- Tramp lacing must only be used as a hardpoint if it is at least 7 mm and is tied off at frequent intervals to prevent a zippering failure.\n- Dont fall in. The tether must make it impossible to fall off. If this is not possible, remember that at over 15 knots the harness and tether will tear you in half; you will be better off without a tether if you go over the rail. PFD and PLB always.\n- Rigging must be foolproof at speed. Over time, you become accustomed to the speed and it is easy to become complacent.\n- In-shore and supervised racing. If MOB recovery is fast and dependable, it is probably safer to fall cleanly into the water than to be caught by a tether, hanging over the side. This is NOT an excuse for lax sailing practices; use short tethers that will keep you on-board and move carefully. Be certain of your MOB recovery drill. PFDs and personal locator beacons are essential. Night and bad weather can invalidate this exception very quickly.\n- Some sailors add chest-high lifelines between the shrouds-a practice that has its cons (see PS June 2018).\n- Add non-skid anywhere your foot can go. Areas around hatches and cleats are too often left slick.\n- Add non-skid on steep slopes. Often sloping cabin sides become walking surfaces when heeled. And even if a surface is too steep to walk on, when a foot is placed there in a stumble, good non-skid will make the slide considerably slower and often times recoverable.\n- A swimmer-accessible ladder is a must for cruisers and short-handed racers. There have been serious incidents, even at anchor, when a sailor suddenly learned how difficult it is to reboard a high freeboard boat from the water. A ladder can be a great aid to recovering an uninjured MOB. However, it may not be usable in rough weather and do not assume the victim will be able to get to it.\n- Lines in the water. A common reason for not being able to start the engine during MOB recovery is the risk of fouling the prop with lines in the water. Keep the tails tidied up at all times so that this is not a risk. If you need the engine, spend just a few minutes hauling the line in. Shorthanded or with less skilled crew, using the engine may be the safest way.\n- A parting thought, many of us reach a balance of risk that we are comfortable with and become complacent. Experience alone does not automatically make you a safer sailor."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2111ed9b-b66f-490a-87c2-a370187e2914>","<urn:uuid:4628e1d3-a0a7-43f3-bf4e-79f65a27d427>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How did the management of urban transit services differ between American cities and British metropolitan counties during the 1980s?","answer":"In American cities during the 1980s, transit systems were primarily operated by local governments who had taken over from private companies, with federal government providing financing for expansions and renovations. In contrast, British metropolitan counties handled their local services through Passenger Transport Executives under the broader Regional Railways sector, which was part of British Rail. This represented different approaches to urban transit management - direct local government control in America versus a more structured, nationally-integrated approach in Britain through the Regional Railways system.","context":["Few alive today can remember, but public transit (subways, commuter rail, buses, streetcars, and ferries) was once a for-profit industry. So how did nearly all of these services ended up under government ownership? Because, at a point, private owners walked away from them. Cities, regional authorities, and states stepped in to keep the services alive and, in many cases, expand them.\nSo this is the story of one of government’s strengths: its steadfastness. Once it recognizes a vital service, it doesn’t give up on it as easily as corporations. We’ll get into why transit is considered vital to cities but, first, a little history.\nTransit in America began in the early 1800s with ferry boats and horse-drawn wagons called omnibuses. For a price, these private services would take passengers across a river or across town on a fixed route—like modern-day buses and streetcars. But an omnibus ride was a bumpy one since most streets were either dirt or cobblestones. Before the Civil War, then, to smooth the ride, some private companies laid down rails on the streets for the wagons to use. For this, they needed government approval, since cities owned the streets. This was the point when government first played a role in transit, as granters of rights of way.\nIt wasn’t until engineers figured out how to use electricity as a means of locomotion, though, that the “mass” part of mass transit took off. Electricity allowed private companies to build efficient streetcars and, later, elevated trains and subways that could move large numbers at small, “token” prices.\nAs transit grew, so did congestion. By the early 1900s, city streets had become a jumble of transportation modes. There were streetcars, pedestrians, bicyclists, horse-drawn wagons, and a few privately owned cars, all fighting for a piece of the pavement. (For a glimpse, watch this video of New York in 1911, starting at the 1:28 mark.) That’s why the transit companies wanted exclusive right of ways, either above the street (in elevated trains) or below (in subways).\nThis got some of the transit out of public streets, but the tunnels and elevated tracks required even greater government cooperation. New York’s subways, for instance, were mostly “cut and cover” projects. That is, streets were dug up, tunnels and tracks built, then the streets were covered again. In most cities, the construction was privately financed but the city had to give its permission to close the streets and its elected officials felt the anger of residents and businesses that were disrupted.\nSo here was another way government became a major player in mass transit, as a partner in its construction. There was yet another role it came to play: regulator of fares. Why? Because, in nearly every case, the transit companies were monopoly businesses. And in return for the monopoly status—and the city’s help with construction—local governments gained a say in transit fares, much as state public service commissions set electric and natural gas rates today. It was another step toward government involvement.\nWhy did the private companies leave the business? Because it became less profitable as cars pushed their way into cities. Transit ridership peaked in 1926, then began a steady decline as more people drove to work or shopping. And as profits declined, so did maintenance, which encouraged yet more people to abandon buses and trains for private automobiles.\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, one city government after another bought out the private companies and took over their train and bus lines. The best that cities could do, at first, was maintain the systems they had bought, and without expansion or improvements, ridership continued its decline.\nWhat changed things in the 1960s and 1970s was that the federal government started financing transit. This led to brand-new rapid transit systems in Washington, D.C., San Francisco-Oakland, and Atlanta, and expansions and renovations for older systems like those in Boston and Chicago.\nBy the early years of the 21st century, transit ridership was rising again. Then, in about 2010, ridership hit a wall. There were a number of reasons. In places like New York and Washington, D.C., transit systems had deferred maintenance to the point that service suffered. And as trains became overcrowded and undependable, riders looked for alternatives—and found it in new transportation services, like Uber and Lyft.\nBetter management was beginning to turn around big-city transit systems when, in 2020, ridership fell off a cliff with the Covid-19 pandemic and the public health shutdown that followed. It is unclear when or how ridership will improve. Still, no major American city signaled an intention to give up on transit.\nWhy are local governments so committed to public transit? Because transit has important positive externalities: It makes cities more affordable. It reduces pollution. It creates denser development, which makes streets livelier. And it leads to more productive land uses by reducing one of the most wasteful uses, which is parking. (To see how transit can change land uses, compare San Francisco’s two baseball parks, the old Candlestick Park, remote and surrounded by parking, and the new Oracle Park, with transit at its doorstep.)\nIf you’ve ever taken a train or bus in a city—or merely appreciated the liveliness of urban streets—you can thank government for maintaining the transit systems that make these possible.\nGive the credit to: local governments 70%, federal government 30%","|Franchise(s):||Not subject to franchising|\n|Main region(s):||East Anglia, North West, North East, Wales|\n|Other region(s):||East Midlands, West Midlands, Scotland, Merseyside|\n|Parent company:||British Rail|\nThe sector was broken up into 8 franchises during the privatisation of British Rail, and ceased to exist on 31 March 1997.\nUpon sectorisation in 1982, three passenger sectors were created: InterCity, operating principal express services; London & South East (renamed Network SouthEast in 1986) operating commuter services in the London area; and Provincial (renamed Regional Railways in 1989) responsible for all other passenger services. In the metropolitan counties local services were managed by the Passenger Transport Executives.\nRegional Railways inherited a diverse range of routes, comprising both express and local services. Expresses mainly ran to non-principal destinations or on less popular routes, such as Birmingham or Liverpool to Norwich or Liverpool to Scarborough, and were chiefly operated by older locomotives and second-hand InterCity coaches. Later these services were operated by Sprinter units - mainly Class 158s on express services. There were also the internal Scottish Region local services and expresses, the latter including the Edinburgh-Glasgow push-pull service.\nLocal services ran on both main lines and branch lines, and were often operated by first generation diesel multiple units dating back to the 1950s. Longer distance trains often formed of older coaches and locomotives of Class 31, Class 40 and Class 45 which were of similar vintage.\nDevelopment of new rolling stock\nIn the early 1980s, large numbers of diesel multiple unit (DMU) and locomotive-hauled coaches were found to contain asbestos. Removing this would be a considerable cost and generating no extra revenue, which, coupled with the increasingly unreliabile old locomotives and DMUs prompted BR to look for a new generation of diesel multiple units.\nThe first, Pacers, used bus technology from the Leyland National, in classes numbered in the 14X range. Not long after introduction to service large numbers of them suffered from a number of technical problems, particularly with their gearboxes. In Cornwall it was found that their long wheelbase caused intolerable squealing noises and high tyre wear on tight curves, and they quickly had to be replaced by the old DMUs. The solution obviously lay elsewhere, although after much modification, the Pacers eventually proved themselves in traffic.\nBR ideally needed something mid-way between the Pacers and the Class 210s. In 1984/1985, two experimental DMU designs were put into service: the BREL Class 150 and Metro-Cammell Class 151. Both of these used hydraulic transmission and were less bus-like than the Pacers. After trials, the Class 150 was selected for production, entering service from 1987. Reliability was much improved by the new units, with depot visits being reduced from two or three times a week to fortnightly.\nThe late 1980s and early 1990s also saw the development of secondary express services that complemented the mainline Intercity routes. Class 155 and Class 156 Sprinters were developed to replace locomotive-hauled trains on these services; their interiors being designed with longer distance journeys in mind. In particular, key Scottish and Transpennine routes were upgraded with new Class 158 Express Sprinters, while a network of 'Alphaline' services was introduced elsewhere in the country.\nBy the end of the 1980s, passenger numbers had increased and costs had been reduced to two-and-a-half times revenue.\nFrom 1986, Provincial adopted a version of the prototype Class 150 livery: \"aircraft\" blue over white, with a light blue stripe at waist level. All new units, plus a few existing ones, such as selected Class 304 EMUs, received it. Some units and coaches received the livery with either \"ScotRail\" or \"Trans-Pennine\" branding.\nThe Class 158s, introduced in 1989, appeared in \"Express\" livery: dark grey window surrounds over light grey, with light and dark blue stripes at waist level. This colour scheme was also applied to some Class 156 units around privatisation.\nThe final British railway vehicle to carry Regional Railways livery was a Class 153, which was repainted in July 2008 into East Midlands Trains livery. However, the Class 158 units operated by State Railway of Thailand carried Regional Railways livery until they were refurbished in 2011.\nSplit for privatisation\nAs part of the process of privatisation between 1994 and 1997, Regional Railways was split into several different shadow train operating units, which later became independent train operating companies:\n|Train Operating Unit||Routes|\n|Anglia Railways||Routes in East Anglia (combined with InterCity services in the region).|\n|Cardiff Railway Company||Urban 'Valley Lines' services around Cardiff, previously integrated within the South Wales and West division.|\n|Central Trains||Regional Railways' Central division, minus the services transferred to Anglia Railways and the Oxford to Worcester service.

{"question":"What's the connection between Winston Churchill's 1941 radio broadcast about Nazi atrocities and the emergence of the term 'retronym' in 1980? Both seem to deal with naming things! 🧐","answer":"Both instances indeed deal with the significance of naming, but in different contexts. Churchill's 1941 broadcast highlighted the absence of a term to describe Nazi atrocities, stating they were witnessing 'a crime without a name' (which would later be termed 'genocide' by Raphael Lemkin in 1943). In contrast, the term 'retronym,' which emerged in 1980, refers to creating new terms for existing concepts when the original terms become ambiguous. While Churchill was addressing the lack of a term for a new type of crime, retronyms deal with the need to rename existing concepts due to evolving circumstances.","context":["Naming crimes: genocide and public opinion in the United States\nDebates about the label “genocide” distract from the substantive discussion about whether and how to stop the killing.\nOn August 24, 1941, two months after Germany's invasion of the Soviet Union, Winston Churchill addressed the British people in a live radio broadcast. Describing intelligence reports he had received from occupied Russia, Churchill reported: “Scores of thousands of executions in cold blood are being perpetrated by the German police troops…We are in the presence of a crime without a name.” Although the Polish jurist Raphael Lemkin coined the term “genocide” in 1943 to give these crimes a name, heated debates about the use of the word have continued ever since in response to almost every episode of mass atrocity since World War II.\nIn recent years the most prominent chapter in this debate occurred in response to the violence in Darfur, Sudan in 2003. In July 2004, prompted by pressure from human rights groups and the press, the US House of Representatives passed a resolution declaring that the “the atrocities unfolding in Darfur, Sudan, are genocide,” and in September, the Secretary of State, Colin Powell, officially concurred. In January 2005, however, the UN released its own report on Darfur concluding that, although crimes against humanity had been committed, there was insufficient evidence to support a charge of genocide.\nThe conflicting findings sparked an intense debate. Those in favor of using the term genocide argued that applying this label to Darfur would establish a moral imperative for taking action. Critics, on the other hand, argued that the term obscured the complex reality of the conflict in Sudan—exaggerating the scope of the violence, and distorting its causes and the motives of the government and the rebels. Both sides seemed to agree, however, that the outcome of the debate held the key to American public opinion and, ultimately, to the fate of the people of Darfur.\nPress Association Images/ALFRED DE MONTESQUIOU (All rights reserved)\nRebel soldiers assemble in Darfur, Sudan in 2007.\nVirtually no evidence exists to demonstrate that this word wields the power attributed to it.However, despite the intensity of debates about the genocide label, virtually no evidence exists to demonstrate that this word wields the power that advocates on both sides of these debates attribute to it. To explore this question scientifically, we fielded an original survey experiment on a representative group of American citizens designed to isolate the effect of framing a violent conflict as “genocide” on public attitudes. Three hundred subjects were randomly assigned to one of two groups and each group was asked to read a different version of a fictional news story about a civil conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\nEach story reported that key public figures—US State Department spokesperson, Robert Wood, and the United Nations Secretary General, Ban Ki Moon—had issued important public statements about the ongoing violence in the country. In order to increase the realism of the experience, the stories were mocked up to look like typical newspaper stories with an Associated Press byline.\nThe conflict scenario described in the article was specifically designed to depict a situation that mirrored the circumstances of recent civil conflicts such as those in Rwanda and Darfur. The conflict was portrayed in the context of ongoing ethnic fighting between the government and rebels, who were demanding increased rights and representation for their minority ethnic group. The conflict was reported to have escalated recently when the rebels attacked a police outpost, killing 20 officers. The articles stated that the government responded “with a major crackdown on local civilian populations it suspects of collaborating with the rebels.” The Red Cross was quoted as estimating that 20,000 civilians had been killed by the government in the previous three months along with a warning that “hundreds of thousands of additional deaths are possible if the violence continues.”\nIn each scenario, both Wood and Secretary Ban issued statements deploring the violence in the Congo and calling for a response. In the first scenario, which served as the control group, Wood described a “widespread pattern of violence and killing by the government targeted against civilian populations,” and Ban pointed to “the intentional killing of civilians.” In the second scenario, both Wood and Ban clearly described the situation as constituting “genocide”. Otherwise, the articles were identical.\nAfter reading the article, subjects were asked a series of questions about their views on the conflict, including their moral judgments of both sides and their willingness to support various forms of intervention. First, subjects were asked, “Regardless of what the people quoted in the article said, do you personally think the violence in Congo should be called ‘genocide?’” In the control group, 51% of respondents said it “probably” should, while 26% believed it should “definitely” be called genocide. Among respondents who had received the genocide treatment, however, 39% believed that the conflict should “probably” be called genocide, while 41% believed that it “definitely” should be. Thus, the percentage of people willing to “definitely” call the event genocide increased by 15 points—an increase of over 50% relative to the control.\nInterestingly, though, despite the increase in the willingness of subjects in the genocide group to label the event genocide, we found little evidence that using the word genocide led subjects to draw different ethical judgments about the conflict or to express different preferences about how the United States should respond. As can be seen in figure 1, the results show that subjects in the genocide condition were slightly more likely to condemn the perpetrators as evil, see the victims as innocent, and support different forms of intervention. However, these effects were very small—never exceeding more than .3 points on a 6 point scale—and never approaching statistical significance at conventional levels.\nThis is not to assert that debates over the use of the term genocide are purely semantic. The use of the term genocide may have important legal implications, especially regarding charges brought in criminal cases against alleged perpetrators. Nonetheless, to the extent that such debates are motivated by concerns that the term’s use is critical in building public support for intervention in humanitarian crises, our results suggest that, on the contrary, these debates are more likely to distract from the substantive discussion about whether and how to stop the killing.\nBenjamin A.

The full carbohydrate loading appears in medical literature as early as 1963, but around 1980 endurance athletes took up the practice and the term, clipping it to just carbo-loading.\nchuffing, adj. This British slang euphemism for “fucking” appears. The noun chuff, meaning “buttocks,” dates to at least 1945. The OED gives its origin as unknown, but Green’s Dictionary of Slang says it’s from the British dialectal chuff, meaning “fat, plump.”\ncold call, v. The OED records both the verb to cold call and the corresponding noun, meaning “an unsolicited telephonic sales pitch,” from 1980. But the dictionary has cold calling from 1972, so the two base terms are likely somewhat older.\ncomb-over, n.

But what about the future? Why were we so unprepared for the COVID-19 pandemic? And how will new technologies – ranging from artificial intelligence and robotics to so-called ‘human augmentation’ – impact our societies? In this first contribution of our new topic ‘Tomorrow’s Worlds’, Etienne F. Augé argues that science fiction is a valuable source of inspiration for political analysts offering us a better grip on the future.\nIn the West, most of us are used to a comfortable lifestyle. We can plan ahead due to good health care, a decent pension, and an overall feeling of security. This bubble of safety is sometimes punctured by a crisis, from terrorist attacks to a global pandemic or rumours of a war against China.\nEven though Western governments are better prepared for crises than their counterparts in less developed countries, they remain taken by surprise when the next ‘unforeseen’ crisis hits them. One reason is that governments as well as ordinary citizens are faced with an exponential amount of data.1 Distinguishing between relevant and irrelevant factors and developments becomes harder by the day. Our world has moved from ‘big data’ to ‘impossible-to-handle data’.\nEven ambitious projects from well-funded organisations, like Global Trends 2040 of the American National Intelligence Council2 , often tend to be wrong about their predictions of the future, and are usually rather vague about them. Other well-known initiatives such as Shell’s future scenarios3 , tend to be off the mark for the simple reason that this powerful Anglo-Dutch oil company simply cannot imagine a future where they themselves would become marginalised.\nIt is difficult to blame these organisations as predicting the future remains a nigh impossible task\nThere are numerous reasons why such large, powerful companies like Shell fail to predict the future with some accuracy. One obvious reason is groupthink, a psychological phenomenon that pushes a group to find consensus rather than examine daring ideas. Another could be vested interest, since thinking ‘outside the box’ and imagining a future without Shell is a real career killer for any Shell-employee. A last reason could simply be a lack of imagination, as relying on trends alone often results in tunnel vision, which certainly clouds a clear vision of the future.\nIt is difficult to blame these organisations as predicting the future remains a nigh impossible task. There are numerous past forecasts that got it notoriously wrong. Orrin E. Dunlap Jr. from The New York Times did not see a future for television in 1939, as the “problem with television is that the people must sit and keep their eyes glued on a screen; the average American family hasn’t time for it”.4 Thomas Watson, chairman of IBM, announced in 1943 that there may be “a world market for maybe five computers”.5 And Steve Ballmer, former CEO of Microsoft, famously laughed at the iPhone in 2007, seeing no future in it.6\nFutures Studies: a new idea?\nDespite the many mishaps, it is of course possible to think about the future and design desirable futures – often on the basis of different scenarios. So-called ‘Futures Studies’ have developed extensive methodologies to do exactly that, and a host of futurists are working fulltime around the globe imagining our future, providing scenarios to make humanity better prepared and more resilient to change.\nThis is hardly a novel idea. As early as 1932, one of the founding parents of science fiction, British author H.G. Wells, broadcast on the BBC a short plea entitled ‘Wanted – Professors of Foresight!’ He remarked: “It seems an odd thing to me that though we have thousands and thousands of professors and hundreds of thousands of students of history working upon the records of the past, there is not a single person anywhere who makes a whole-time job of estimating the future consequences of new inventions and new devices. There is not a single Professor of Foresight in the world. But why shouldn't there be?”7\nIt took some time before Wells’ advice was followed. Studying the future has only become part of academic research and teaching since the 1960s. During all phases of the Cold War, strategic planning – including playing so-called ‘War games’ – was considered essential to prepare for an uncertain future.\nFor Western governments, it became existential to imagine how new technologies – ranging from satellites to computers, and from television to the internet – would affect their prosperity and security\nIn 1964 the US-based RAND Corporation famously published the Report on a Long-Range Forecasting Study, stating: “The fact remains, however, for better or for worse, trend predictions – implicit or explicit, ‘scientific’ or intuitive – about periods as far as twenty or even fifty years in the future do affect current planning decisions (or lack of the same) in such areas as national defense, urban renewal, resource development, etc.”8\nThinking about the future was not just a frivolous exercise. For Western governments, it became existential to imagine how new technologies – ranging from satellites to computers, and from television to the internet – would affect their prosperity and security.9 Futures Studies were called upon not only to predict crises, but also to imagine and design better policies concerning all societal sectors, from defence to energy, from education to food, and from supply chains to geopolitics.\nWhat remains surprising is that many experts working in Futures Studies hardly watch science fiction, let alone read it. Most experts dismiss the genre as unserious, a teenage distraction at best. According to its critics, science fiction is barely science, and usually involves poor writing.\nThis bad reputation is largely undeserved and science fiction is often misunderstood. Though there certainly is plenty ‘cheap’ science fiction, some authors have had a lasting impact on societies – think about Isaac Asimov’s ideas on robotics, Philip K. Dick on philosophy, or Frank Herbert on ecology. The list is impressive, and way too long for a single article. Science fiction has had a major impact on our societies, mainly because it has constantly reinvented itself.\nScience fiction is hard to define. One of its best writers, Norman Spinrad, claimed “science fiction is anything published as science fiction”.10 This generous definition would also include famous mainstream authors into the category of science fiction. George Orwell’s 1984 is a classic work of fiction, but rarely recognised as science fiction, although Orwell imagines a future dystopia for a reason, namely to avoid it.\nThe category or term science fiction has become a bit of a misnomer. Science was indeed the focus when science fiction started off with authors like Mary Shelley, Jules Verne, and Wells. Today, the element of science is of decreasing importance to the genre, since it has become clear that technology is hardly the answer to all human problems. Since the 1950s, the focus of science fiction is on possible future social change, rather than technology per se. Clearly, authors have drawn lessons from Auschwitz and Hiroshima: science and technology in the wrong hands could well mean the end of humanity.\nModern science fiction trends like hopepunk11 barely make use of technology for their stories, where steampunk – another major trend in science fiction – even creates a uchronia (an idealised or fictional conception of a particular period of time, especially in the past)12 where steam power has again become the main source of energy. The Handmaid's Tale, currently a popular TV show initially based on Margaret Atwood’s novel, also imagines a future world centred around technological regression rather than scientific progress.13\nScience fiction as a source of inspiration\nScience fiction can be a remarkable source of inspiration for Futures Studies as it continually asks the question: what if? The genre can also be used as a sandbox to turn over new ideas, since one of the main purposes of the genre is to discover and invent.\n‘What if cars could fly?’ is a trope in science fiction, but science fiction goes much deeper and questions present societal models by imagining alternative ones. What if women and men were equal in rights? What if earth was not the centre of the universe and aliens really exist? What if artificial intelligence could help us overcome issues such inequality or misinformation? The list is endless, or only limited by our imagination.\nThe global pandemic we are living through today, has been the topic of many works of science fiction\nScience fiction can also be used to prevent the worst from happening, by presenting possible future challenges and problems that today’s policymakers decide to ignore, often for lack of a long-term vision. The global pandemic we are living through today, has been the topic of many works of science fiction: I am Legend in 1954, that inspired three later film adaptations; 12 Monkeys (1995); and more recently the movie Contagion (2011, by Steven Soderbergh14 ).\nThe rise of robots is another favourite topic among science fiction writers and is becoming dangerously close to reality since drones may have attacked humans fully autonomously for the first time in 2021.15 Another classic science fiction theme is the end of the world, though the main difference with religious prophecies is we can avoid doom by reacting soon enough, redemption not being provided by a megalomaniac deity but by societies changing together. Hopefully.\nDue to its spectacular and imaginative qualities, science fiction is Hollywood’s most profitable genre. Today, science fiction movies and television shows comprise about one third of all Netflix productions.\nBoth the US army16 and the French military17 are using the power of science fiction to get better prepared for future conflicts or crises. For modern armies, it is crucial to be able to anticipate how terrorism or guerrilla warfare might evolve, and science fiction writers are able to provide possible scenarios for future conflicts.\nScience fiction is also a major source of inspiration for Silicon Valley’s high-tech companies. Would the ‘metaverse’18 envisioned by the company formerly known as Facebook exist without a description of the next frontier in Neal Stephenson’s Snow Crash? Even in Stephenson’s novel, the metaverse is owned and controlled by a giant corporation known as the Global Multimedia Protocol Group. This tends to show that science fiction has a major power to make things happen through self-fulfilling prophecies – for better or for worse.\nAutocratic states like the People’s Republic of China and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia are also embracing the power of the genre, after initially having strongly rejected science fiction. Recently, Saudi Arabia has commissioned the public relations firm Ruder Finn to promote ‘Neom’, the Saudi mega-city of the future inspired by science fiction.19\nIt seems today that controlling the future contributes to controlling the present, as more and more entities embrace the power of science fiction to literally capture imagination\nNeom is pitched as a city of the future based on “sustainable living” and “focused on setting new standards for community health, environmental protection, and the effective and productive use of technology”, at an initial 500 billion US dollars. Interestingly, Saudi Arabia now brands itself as a future oriented country, sponsoring the UNESCO Future Literacy Summit in 202020 and hosting the 2022 World Science Fiction Convention.\nThe People’s Republic of China has decided to actively encourage science fiction writing ever since they realised that most Silicon Valley inventors and designers were avid science fiction fans, as Neil Gaiman explained in a wonderful conversation with Kazuo Ishiguro.21 Since the Chinese government remains keen on its control over its citizens, special guidelines have been issued to make sure China is depicted in the best way possible.22\n“Who controls the past controls the future: who controls the present controls the past”, George Orwell famously claimed in his 1984. It seems today that controlling the future contributes to controlling the present, as more and more entities embrace the power of science fiction to literally capture imagination.\nUsing science fiction\nScience fiction can still be used for the greater good. Combining scientific methods with the capacity of stimulating imagination from science fiction can lead to a powerful tool to anticipate the future, or make it happen. For that reason, science fiction has become ‘trendy’ as organisations understand that, beyond Futures Studies, there should also be a narrative motivating societies to embrace change.\nEven the United Nations, usually cautious about innovation, has decided to make use of science fiction as an inspiration for its mission, challenging so-called dystopia with better futures imagined with science fiction.23 For now, the European Union remains hesitant to follow the UN’s example. Science fiction could nevertheless help the EU tremendously by creating inclusive scenarios for desirable futures, reducing declinism and limiting fears of tomorrow.\nThere is a long road before academia incorporates Futures Studies as part of all curricula, but we better start today than tomorrow\nThe time might therefore be ripe for giving voice to a new kind of expert who is able to combine ‘traditional’ Futures Studies methodology with storytelling skills to lead societies away from doomsday-thinking. A prime example of such an initiative can be found in Arizona State University (AZU), where the Center for Science and the Imagination collaborates with established science fiction writers like Kim Stanley Robinson, but also with up and coming authors to imagine better futures.24\nIn 2015, inspired by AZU, Erasmus University Rotterdam established the special program called ‘The Consortium’ aimed to combine university-based research skills and creativity, academia and the ‘real world’, and bright students and experienced professionals – all geared towards generating scenarios for the future; hopefully desirable ones. In a world where neither Francis Fukuyama nor Samuel P. Huntington have been right about their vision of the world of the future, we believed it was high time to train our students to design the future they want and be ready for unplanned catastrophic scenarios.\nThere is a long road before academia incorporates Futures Studies as part of all curricula, but we better start today than tomorrow. As Wells warned us in 1932: “Because if it is not to be peace foreseen and planned and established, then it will be disaster and death. Will there be no Foresight until those bombs begin to rain upon us?”7\n- The future of Overcapitalism: Metropolis (1927)\n- The future of Humanity: 2001: a Space Odyssey (1968)\n- The future of the Universe: Solaris (1972)\n- The future of Humans: Blade Runner (1982)\n- The future of Society: Minority Report (2002)\n- The future of our moon: Moon (2009)\n- The present of robots: Animatrix (2013)\n- The future of Time: Predestination (2014)\n- No future: Mad Max: Fury Road (2015)\n- The future of Earth: Aniara (2018)\n- The future of Space: Ad Astra (2019)\n- 1According to the World Economic Forum, the entire digital universe was around 44 zettabytes in 2020, which translates into 44.000.000.000.000.000.000.000 bytes.

{"question":"Can someone explain difference between how Lautner and Wright design interior spaces? I want learning about these famous architects way of making rooms! ¿Cual es la diferencia principal entre sus estilos?","answer":"The key difference in their interior design approaches lies in their flexibility and conventions. Lautner was known for being able to accommodate all client requests while maintaining the overall character of his buildings, creating spaces with great freedom of composition. His interiors often featured a single space with well-balanced variety of spatial conditions. Wright, on the other hand, was more rigid in his interior designs - he would incorporate his design aesthetic into every detail, including built-in furniture and light fixtures, sometimes leading to impractical situations (like hexagonal beds that were difficult to use). Wright focused on open floor plans centered around the hearth as the 'heart' of the home, incorporating abundant natural light through rows of windows. Both architects created innovative interior spaces, but Lautner's approach was more adaptable while Wright's was more controlled and systematized.","context":["Raphael Zuber: I’m constantly thinking of buildings I like, and since a while John Lautner and Vilanova Artigas are very present in my thoughts. Thinking of a house I would like to live in, Sheats-Goldstein Residence is the first one that comes to my mind at this moment. It’s a very grand house, but it’s also nothing else than a platform covered by a tent-like roof and a space under the platform to sleep. This represents an elemental concept of human existence.\nIs there any order at all, or is it rather a hierarchy of things that come together and create a certain tension between themselves?\nMany houses designed and built by Lautner follow a similar principle: one enters the building through a rather long corridor-like path, leading directly to the fireplace in the main space. This main space is usually an outside space in character and one cannot see any other buildings from there. So, entering the house, one moves from outside space to outside space - which in fact is the same space – but by once being public and once being private, the quality of this space is radically changed.\nThis change of perception creates the amazing sensation of the whole world being the house, or, to put it even more dramatically, the house being everything.\nThis experience is strongly emphasized by the fact that all the other rooms are usually not present in the house. They are rather used to form this transition from public into private. This also means that these rooms are often oriented towards the street, which is the most vulnerable and exposed place. But accessing them from the dense interior of the house, even there one feels very private and protected.\nIn the case of Sheats-Goldstein Residence, one goes around the house and enters in its middle. The master bedroom is hidden under the platform. It is cantilevering and can be entirely opened on two sides towards the city. Contradictory qualities, like in this particular case feeling protected and exposed at the same time, I think are essential. They create an ambiguity which is not only intellectual, but also very directly experienced physically. This is thought-provoking and creative.\nIt doesn’t give you a clear idea of how the building looks like from outside. What quality do you see in conceiving and experiencing a building from the inside?\nSheats-Goldstein Residence is surrounded by dense vegetation and is hardly visible from the outside.\nAlso, it doesn`t have any façade. This is of course the consequence of the idea of the house being everything. If the house would be an object, it would be disconnected from its surroundings. What stays in ones memory is rather a secret spot to access a constructed, fantastic world.\nThis is good for a house, but is it possible for other types of buildings to have this quality?\nI could imagine it for every building. For example, imagine a National Parliament Building without any external physical presence! An impressive appearance is the most direct way of representation and of producing an impact, but maybe not the one that lasts longest.\nWhat fascinates us about this house is that the connection between interior and exterior is accidental and unexpected, how do you think this interplay happens?\nApproaching the main space by the entrance path, it’s hard to tell where the house starts. Already there, the border between interior and exterior is blurred. After walking a bit, suddenly one feels protected and elegant, and this is exactly the moment of finally being in the house, even though still being in that same, infinite outside space.\nThere are many different factors making this happen. First of all, walls and glass don’t follow the geometry of the roof and walls do not always touch the roof. Then, there are openings in the roof where one cannot see any frame of the glass and there are mirroring surfaces, including water. In contrast to the very clear initial gestures of platform and freestanding roof, the climatic border is freely composed between these two elements and sometimes even natural elements like rocks. One could call that accidental or improvised, but in fact it’s of course intentional and controlled. I would rather call it unacademic. Often when I experience architecture that is thought through so called correctly, in an academic way, I don’t feel comfortable anymore. Lautner’s houses usually have a genuine looseness which even sharpens their basic idea.\nAnother aspect I like a lot about Sheats-Goldstein Residence is the fact that I think one would feel comfortable and great there both alone and with a crowd. This is very difficult to achieve!\nHow do you think this can happen?\nI would say that such a place or space needs moments of exposure as well as moments of protection. In a rather big space with freedom to move, one might easily feel lost or have difficulties to find a place where to sit. Usually we like to sit where we feel save, close to a solid element like a column, a wall or a ceiling, and rather in the dark. In that way we might be less seen or surprised. And we like to have an open view towards a point of interest. The opposite is the stage, where we get attention and attack or seduce. In this aspect we are very much alike animals, for different actions we instinctively chose different spatial conditions.\nSheats-Goldstein Residence is one single space with an extremely well balanced variety of all possible spatial conditions. And still, it’s not just a collection or a collage of many different things. It’s a basic idea, which in its consequence and virtuosity creates a oneness containing all these qualities. I think that John Lautner as well as Frank Lloyd Wright were both masters in designing such spaces.\nIf you compare FLW with Lautner, what similarities and differences do you see?\nAn obvious difference is that Wright’s buildings usually are very carefully designed into the landscape. Lautner’s buildings often relate brutally to the landscape, do not have any façade and look ugly from outside. They are less objects in a landscape but rather create new worlds within another one.\nBut both Wright and Lautner were definitely extremely inventive and radical, and both of them built a lot. In Frank Lloyd Wrights work one can see a development from rather classical ideas of space towards more and more totally independent creations. Lautner, having learned from Wright, started at a different point of course. His work, already quite early in his career, was absolutely free of any conventions or references.\nI would argue though that Wright’s houses are more elegant and cultivated than the ones designed by Lautner. At the same time, they are a bit more stubborn or formal. Even though I conceptually completely understand a hexagonal bed in a certain context, I once hardly managed to sleep in a house designed by him because I couldn’t figure out in which direction to lay myself down. I would have preferred a round bed, for example, with no direction. Lautner therefore was known for telling to his clients that he could deal with all of their requests, at least that is what I heard. One can read such an attitude in his buildings, and it seems that he really managed to strengthen the overall character and quality of his buildings by doing that, rather than compromising them. But both, Wright and Lautner, are definitely amongst the very best architects we have known.\nFrom what you say, it doesn’t seem very intellectual, rather it’s a generous and playful response to the basic needs of a person.\nLautner’s buildings are not like a mathematical formula with only one correct result. His buildings are usually based on ideas - like for example the idea `the house is everything` - which causally determine some very clear criteria.\nBut at the same time they also leave space to and require personal imagination and virtuosity of the author. I think it’s mainly the basicness of ideas on which Lautner’s buildings are based that lead to this freedom of composition and ultimately to buildings of such enormous generosity. But of course without talent and joy one could very easily fail working in that way.\nIf you physically feel good, do you need to understand a house?\nAnything without content is in the best case good craftsmanship. All the great things are based on a speculation or an idea. And both, speculation and idea, we can rationalize and discuss. If there isn`t anything challenging our minds, a building might get boring quite soon.\nDo you think Lautner’s buildings work only in the context of rich private clients, or can they also deal with low budget situations?\nThe kind of architecture Lautner did is not dependent on budget or any other imposed restrictions. Rather the opposite, I think he was able to deal with any kind of circumstances. As far as I know he started out working with extremely low budgets. His first house he built for himself, and he didn’t have any money. He got a loan from a friend to buy the plot and another loan from another friend to build the house. So he went full risk. For quite a while he built houses with low budgets, sometimes on plots considered unbuildable. When potential clients didn’t have enough money to build he would recommend them to buy one of these problematic plots, for example on the rocks or by a steep slope, and invent a way of building there. These houses turned out to be quite spectacular sometimes and would attract richer clients over time. But I would argue that the quality of his architecture didn’t gain or lose by that, and I argue in general that the quality of a piece of Architecture is not related in any sense to money.\nIn the end his houses are also very pragmatic. If a client would have wanted a wall with windows instead of a huge glass in a specific case, do you think this is something he could have dealt with?\nThis is a very extreme scenario (laughing)! I am convinced he would have found a solution to almost every problem of this nature. And if not he would probably have changed the basic layout or even the idea of the house.\nStill, you need to be open mentality to accept what he proposed. If we made a survey about Lautner’s work, probably 70% of the people would call it insane.\nToday, I would say that 99% would not dare to build as much out of conventions as he did! At least not in Europe. Probably this is also partly due to the American spirit, where people are used to bet on a lot of things. I am not an expert, but American Modernism dealt a lot with the new cheap technologies of prefabrication: after WW1 they needed to build a lot and fast. This, together with the fact that the USA have a thin history and tradition, definitely helped to form a more experimental and pioneering general attitude. Today this mindset is probably moving ever closer to the European one of conserving and administrating.\nGoing back to his own house: he obviously built it with basically no money, risking everything he had including his future, and he built it as an example. It was not as extreme as later projects, but it was uncommon for the time. Lautner himself writes that after seeing the house built, people from the neighborhood would start to get interested in his work. We are usually afraid of the unconventional, we like what we know. With this I want to say that a certain effort and willingness to risk are required to possibly create or get something exceptional!\nDoes a Lautner style exist?\nThere are certain ideas and qualities being essential to his works, and he kept developing them during his entire career. I’m thinking now for example of the connection of interior and exterior, of the relationship between public and private or of the position of the fireplace. But in terms of taste he was totally free and didn’t follow any formal language or preferences. Seeing some of his buildings, without studying them deeper, one would think they were designed by different authors. By comparing for example Sheats-Goldstein Residence to Schaffer or Harpel Residence II more carefully though, it becomes obvious that these buildings are quite similar in essence, but extremely different in visual appearance and in lifestyle. In Lautner’s work, everything not being a crucial consequence of the basic idea could completely change.\nActually, the more I’m thinking about how I would like to live, the more a certain robustness, in every sense, becomes important to me. It’s nice and generous to know that your house doesn’t need much maintenance and you don’t need to clean it too often. Or that you could even simply clean it with a hose from time to time. It’s also nice to know that one could have a party with many people and that nothing could destroy the essential qualities of the house.\nThe generosity you are talking about is given mainly by the dimensions of space, right?\nI’m rather thinking of a generosity as a consequence of robustness, both physically as well as intellectually. Telmo Porto House by Vilanova Artigas for example is not a big house in size. But the material concrete and the directness of construction gives it the same indestructible presence that also Sheats-Goldstein Residence has. And, both houses are based on the quite simple, but grand and powerful idea of creating an infinite, private space. They are both houses that can’t be destroyed by personal taste or a slightly inappropriate proportion.","Each week we pay homage to a select “Original Creator” — an iconic artist from days gone by whose work influences and informs today’s creators. These are artists who were innovative and revolutionary in their fields. Bold visionaries and radicals, groundbreaking frontiersmen and women who inspired and informed culture as we know it today. This week: Frank Lloyd Wright.\nWidely considered one of the most esteemed American architects, Frank Lloyd Wright (1867-1959) designed over 1,000 projects over the course of his prolific career, yielding over 500 completed works, including personal homes, offices, churches, schools, skyscrapers, hotels, and museums. He was also one of the first architects to incorporate his design aesthetic into every detail of his buildings, conceiving complementary interiors, built-in furniture, light fixtures and stained glass—employing himself as an architect of space, not just of structure. It is believed that playing with Froebel Gifts (geometric blocks that could be arranged in various 3D compositions) as a young child greatly influenced his work, as his designs are known for their geometric clarity and structure.\nWright never received formal architecture schooling, and and even turned down an offer to study for free at École des Beaux-Arts in Paris because he thought the classical education he would receive would conflict with his vision for modern architecture. He was a pioneering student in the fields of Organic, Usonian, and the Prairie schools of architecture designing for a servant-less, domesticated American culture that incorporated more open floor plans and “workspaces” into his homes and buildings. Some consider his “open” design technique to be a metaphor for the openness of American political and social life.\nDespite multiple marriages and a semi-tumultuous personal life, Wright was very successful in his professional career, honored with an Honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1955, and recognized in 1991 by the American Institute of Architects as “the greatest American architect of all time,” among other numerous awards and achievements. In addition to influencing modern designers like Mies van der Rohe and post-modernists like Frank Gehry, Wright was a writer, educator, and an active dealer of Japanese art. Here we look at five of his most significant architectural designs.\nFrederick C. Robie House (1908): Chicago, Illinois\nThe Frederick C. Robie house, a U.S. National Historic Landmark, is known as the greatest example of Wright’s Prairie styled homes, a type of architecture that is considered most uniquely American, and is recognizable by long horizontal lines thought to invoke the prairie landscape. The home features cantilevered roof eves, the usage of Roman bricks, four fireplaces, 174 art glass windows and door panels in 29 different designs. In 1956, The Architectural Record selected the Robie House as “one of the seven most notable residences ever built in America.”\nEnnis House (1924): Los Angeles, California\nThe Ennis House was originally designed as a residential home, modeled after the designs of ancient Roman temples, and constructed out of pre-cast concrete blocks. It’s most impressive qualities are the engraved details on the exterior blocks, making it a popular location for numerous movies, fashion shoots, music videos, and TV shows including Blade Runner, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, The Karate Kid, Part III, and Mulholland Drive.\nFallingwater (1935): Mill Run, Pennsylvania\nFallingwater is perhaps Wright’s most famous residential home, partly built over a waterfall, and originally designed for the Kaufmann family before becoming a museum in 1964. The home was designed as a nature retreat for the Kaufmann’s, invoked design elements of Japanese architecture, and utilized a nearby quarry’s rocks for the exterior walls. The building is surrounded by broad balconies that open up to the outside, and notable features include a staircase that leads down from the living room to the stream that is accessed by movable glass panes. Fallingwater is listed among Smithsonian magazine’s 28 Places To Visit Before You Die, and for good reason.\nJohnson Wax Building (1936): Racine, Wisconsin\nThe Johnson Wax Building, the world headquarters of S.C. Johnson & Son, is one of Wright’s most notable commercial works, featuring over 200 different types of curved red bricks seen on the interior and exterior. Wright utilized Pyrex glass tubing in the interior to let in soft light, and the overall building structure is an example of streamlined design.\nThe free-flowing “Great Room” in the interior of the building features innovative columns that Wright coined as “lily pads.” After demonstrating that a single column could support 60 tons of weight, Wright was given his building permit.\nSolomon R. Guggenheim Museum (1959): New York, New York\nThe Guggenheim art museum, located on the Upper East Side in Manhattan, NY is home to collections of Impressionist, Post-Impressionist, early Modern and contemporary artwork. The pristine white structure is considered one of Wright’s last major works, and the interior mimics the inside of a seashell. Wright originally designed the structure with the idea that patrons would take the elevator to the top and then view the artwork as they descended the spiral ramp, though currently the museum displays the artwork directing patrons to ascend the ramp instead of starting at the top.\nFrank Lloyd Wright’s homes and buildings can still be seen strewn across America, concentrated most heavily around Buffalo, NY; Chicago, IL; Los Angeles, CA; and Scottsdale, AZ. Most of them continue to be preserved as U.S. National Landmarks, and certain places are open to the general public. Wright’s designs completely changed the way American homes are built and structured, and he was the first architect to focus on how the interior space reflected the exterior skeleton of his buildings. Wright believed in designing something as a unit, whether it be the marriage of the interior and exterior layouts, or the geometric patterns and building blocks that made up his designs, which is echoed in the practice of many generative architects today.\nInstead of copying European architecture, he chose to be inspired by existing elements of nature, invoking Japanese influences as seen in Fallingwater, as well as building architecture that flowed with the structures’ natural surroundings, most notably in his Prairie style residences throughout rural America. He introduced floor plans that were more open and flowing, and were focused around the hearth, which he believed the “heart” of the home. His designs were also some of the first to utilize an abundance of natural light, evident in his frequent rows of windows, and through the intricate skylights featured in his more commercial work.\nHis designs of Fallingwater and the Guggenheim have become so ingrained in popular culture that they’ve recently been made into Lego sets, introducing his style and innovations to the younger generations, as well as inspiring the builder in all of us. Frank Lloyd Wright’s work can be viewed currently in the Frank Lloyd Wright: Organic Architecture for the 21st Century exhibition at the Milwaukee Art Museum, through May 15, 2011."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:575ff709-977b-49b0-a41a-c85dbcc50d9a>","<urn:uuid:57a32901-3bdf-4fa2-adde-657eedfac2d1>"],"error":null}

It is well known as the owner of Morakot Cave. Koh Muk is virtually more interesting for its beautiful beaches of fertile natural surroundings.\nOutcrop off Koh Muk's northwest point, The rook itself is covered in masses of splendid purple and red soft corals, with holes and cracks providing hiding places for fish. You can head either south along the west coast or east along the north coast - both options offer overhangs, but the latter is the most interesting. More significant than the diving on offer, there's an interesting adventure for snorkellers\nThe emerald cave is a secret paradise hidden behind 250 meter soaring cliffs, nestled in the middle of Koh Mook. To gain access visitors must swim through a natural tunnel, once through a small sandy beach with lush vegetation and vine covered cliffs is the reward. This is an adventure you will never forget! And this is only one of many stops during the day, so prepare for an excursion beyond the ordinary.","Muck Diving on Koh Tao\nFancy a change when diving? Want a different type of diving challenge? Ever wondered what is out there away from the coral reefs? This is what muck diving is all about! This a favourite pastime of advanced divers, macro divers and budding underwater photographers. Many unique and exotic marine animals can be found for those with a keen eye and plenty of patience.\nWhat is “Muck Diving”?\nMuck diving is usually found in sandy, silty bottoms, often situated away from the coral reef. This can mean visibility is easily reduced. Ideal areas often consist of natural debris such as coral skeletons as well as unfortunate man-made rubbish like tyres and fishing equipment.\nThese areas can be a short distance from regular dive sites or just off the beach during shore dives. The term “muck diving” was first coined by scuba diving legend Bob Halstead as he dived off the beaches of Papua New Guinea.\nDiscover and Explore\nAs this type of diving is away from the normal reef and dive sites it gets you back to one of the key components of why people become scuba divers – to explore new areas and discover new amazing creatures. There will certainly be reduced diver traffic as you head out into the sand for your new challenge and you should find some hidden gems lying out there. There may not be many fish for you to see but with patience and a little experience you will find different eco systems and unusual creatures that often don’t inhabit the coral reef.\nTips and Tricks\nThe key to muck diving is having great buoyancy, being able to move very slowly and not disturbing the bottom is essential for viewing the hidden creatures you will find out there. The silt can very easily be disturbed so ensure your fin kicks are not creating a dust cloud behind you. The frog kick technique, while ensuring your fins are raised behind you, is the best way to go.\nRemain focused on the environment and look for anything that looks slightly out of place. Usually the easiest way to spot a camouflaged critter is to look out for fins or eyes. Take your time and carefully study every object you come across ensuring to also look underneath things, as often these are favourite hiding places of creatures such as shrimps.\nYou should ensure you research the area before joining the dive trip, asking the local dive shops and guides to get a better understanding of the local area and knowledge of what marine life you could expect to see and where you may see it. The can be a few hidden dangers such as scorpion fish and stone fish that you should be aware of as they can easily blend into their surroundings with their excellent camouflage.\nThe Mucky Sites on Koh Tao\nOne of the joys of muck diving Koh tao is the ease of access. It really is as easy as grabbing your scuba equipment and a buddy before heading straight off the beach for a dive in the sand. Koh Tao beaches such as Chalok Ban Khao and Sai Nuan on the southern end of the island offer lovely shallow sites for you to have a look around.\nThere are also a few Koh Tao dive sites where once you venture off the main reef you have a good chance of coming across different marine species. Mango Bay on the North side of Koh Tao is a large bay with corals on either side but a nice large sand patch in the middle for you to explore.\nKoh Tao’s Top Muck Diving Creatures….\nThese creatures are abundant in other diving areas around Thailand but sightings are quite rare here on Koh Tao especially upon the main coral reefs. But whilst out in the sand they can be found around the dive sites such as White Rock. The lionfish makes a beautiful underwater photography subject with its majestic fins and lovely colouration.\nA burrowing eel that is a nervous creature rarely leaving its burrow to explore, these can be seen in the big sand patch of Mango Bay with them popping their heads out of the sand. This species is more placid when compared to its cousins the morays. The snake eel is pointed to help dig the hole which becomes its protective burrow.\nA big favourite for scuba divers of all levels to come across due to its uniquely cute appearance. Sightings of these animals are varied with them popping up at Twins, Mango Bay and Tao Tong in recent times. They are named for their similarity in appearance to the equine species with bent necks and long snouted heads followed by their distinctive tail.\nA truly amazing creature that can change its colour in a blink of an eye making this Cephalopod a master of camouflage. The change in colours can also be used to communicate with other cuttlefish when warning off rivals, attracting a mate and even to help coordinate hunting with other cuttlefish.\nThese strikingly coloured little slugs are fascinating to watch under the water and a favourite for avid muck divers. Here on Koh Tao we have had 64 different species recorded around the island. The word ‘nudibranch‘ is originated from the Latin word ‘nudus’ (meaning naked) as this animal uses its dorids to breathe, this is basically a naked gill situated on its back.\nAuthor: Neil Davidson (PADI MSDT #294100)"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2a8e7018-f7c8-4306-bfeb-212a2ae70a69>","<urn:uuid:22e75b45-c2b8-4cc6-8352-0451043f2677>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What similarities exist between the inaugural production spaces of Rose of Athens Theatre and the original Globe Theatre in terms of their physical conditions?","answer":"Both theaters faced challenging physical conditions in their early days. Rose of Athens Theatre's first production was performed in an unheated space that reached 17 degrees, requiring space heaters and blankets for the audience who sat on coffee bean bags. Similarly, the original Globe Theatre was open-air in London's seedy entertainment district, exposing audiences to the elements, though it was later destroyed by fire in 1613.","context":["Rose of Athens Theatre creates vibrant professional theatre that inspires audiences and transforms communities.\n* * * *\nRose of Athens Theatre creates live performances that endeavor to speak to the entire community.

Here, productions were put on by the Lord Chamberlain’s Men, who included in their company Shakespeare himself. Although the theatre was rebuilt after the fire, it was eventually torn down in 1644, and as London’s entertainment centre moved west, this stretch of South Bank between Blackfriars and London Bridge was all but forgotten for generations.\nFast forward to 1997, when, after decades of campaigning led by the actor Sam Wanamaker, a recreation of the Globe opened very close to where the original had stood. With a design based on as much historical detail as could be found, Shakespeare’s Globe was intended to bring a true theatrical experience to life, plays presented in a manner as close as possible to the kind of setting and conditions The Bard would have originally written for.\nThe modern Shakespeare’s Globe only holds about half the capacity of the original, but you can still get a rich feel for what it was like to be a ‘groundling’ (the standing rabble at the front of the stage) when you come to see a play here, in the circular, open-air theatre.\nHowever, a visit here isn’t just a history lesson. The theatre productions here are among the best in London. Each season (spring to early autumn) includes several Shakespeare classics, performed by a company of established and upcoming actors, while works of other writers are also programmed. The Globe also now offers performances in the recently opened Sam Wanamaker Playhouse – a candlelit indoor theatre within the Globe’s building, which presents plays in a traditional Jacobean setting.

{"question":"Can you explain how the HMS Challenger expedition contributed to marine science, and what are the key properties of ocean water that it helped us understand?","answer":"The HMS Challenger expedition (1872-1876) made groundbreaking contributions to marine science through its 68,890-mile journey. The expedition discovered 4,700 new species, mapped the Marianas Trench, and revealed the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, establishing the first broad outline of ocean basin shapes. Regarding ocean water properties, we now know that ocean water is 96% pure water, containing dissolved gases and solids. The remaining composition includes chlorine (1.9%) and sodium (1.1%), forming table salt, and oceanographers believe oceans contain 85 of 90 natural elements found on Earth. The expedition's findings led to our understanding of how salinity levels vary based on factors like freshwater input, temperature, and marine life activity, and how dissolved gases (nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and oxygen) vary with depth and are more abundant at the ocean's surface where sunlight enables plant life.","context":["For humans, the ocean has long been a realm of both intrigue and intimidation. It captivates our minds with its beauty and mystery, yet also humbles even the strongest men with its power and, sometimes, merciless nature. For long, we have relied on it for our survival, yet countless have perished in its waters. It is not difficult to understand why humans share this unusual connection with the ocean. We are, after all, physically designed for an entirely terrestrial lifestyle. In fact, even the greatest of human swimmers seem clumsy in comparison to aquatic animals (and even many terrestrial animals) when in the water. As a result, an environment such as the open ocean, though beautiful and inspiring, could easily make many of us feel vulnerable and helpless. However, the ocean’s attractive qualities often rival this fear. This is probably due to the fact that the ocean itself contains a great world vastly different from ours. Below the surface exists a massive realm which far exceeds our terrestrial home in variety and size. Complex ecosystems and countless unique species can be observed throughout the great expanses of water which make up the majority of the earth’s surface. The seemingly endless resources available from the ocean are primarily why humans have long maintained their connection with the seas ever since they first discovered them. Throughout the generations, our knowledge and appreciation of the oceans have grown as we continue to discover more of the marine realm’s secrets. Yet, even today, we must acknowledge that we still know little about this world, for much of what we do know about the ocean consists of information concerning its surface. The waters housing seals, marine birds, colorful fish of many varieties, dolphins, and other well known animals are but a small fraction of the ocean. In reality, the ocean conceals a world much more massive than that which we are familiar with, a zone which seems more like outer space than a true ecosystem. Dark, frigid, and hidden under vast, crushing volumes of water, this alien range has developed with little to no interaction with the surface environments. It is almost disconnected with the events of the upper oceanic layers, and the fantastic forms of life present here, though relatively rare, will truly shock you.\nThe oceans possess a variety of different environments due to their massive size and depths. As a result, it is important to understand their divisions. There are two broad realms present in the oceans, the pelagic and the benthic. The pelagic zone is the open water in which swimming and floating species (generally known as pelages) occur. Since the oceans are so deep, the pelagic zone must be divided into more specific zones as well. The epipelagic zone is the uppermost level and is observed in depths less than 200 meters. Since sunlight easily reaches into this zone, photosynthesis can take place in the epipelagic division. Below the epipelagic exists the mesopelagic zone, which is observed in depths of 200-1000 meters. Known as the “twilight” zone, the faint presence of sunlight in this area is not sufficient for the process of photosynthesis. The bathypelagic zone contains no sunlight whatsoever and can be observed 1000-4000 meters below the surface, followed by the abyssopelagic at depths of 4000-6000 meters. The deepest level of all is the frigid hadopelagic zone, which consists of deep trenches that can drop anywhere from more than 6000 meters to nearly 11,000 meters in depth.\nMeanwhile, the benthic zones are defined as the bottom sediments and other surfaces of a body of water such as an ocean or a lake. The species present in these zones, known as benthos, live in close relationship with the bottom of the sea, as many of them are attached to it, some are often burrowed in it, and others swim just above it. The benthic zones of oceanic habitats are categorized by depths corresponding to the comparable pelagic zones. First is the intertidal zone, which has no pelagic counterpart. This is the zone where sea meets land, ending in the beaches that humans often enjoy traveling to. This is followed by the subtidal zone, which drops to a depth of about 200 meters. It contains the continental shelves, which are basically the submerged portions of the continents. This continues into the bathyal zone, which lies up to 4000 meters below the water’s surface. This zone contains the continental slopes, steep drops which carry on from where the continental shelves conclude. Most of the deep ocean seafloor, known as the deep ocean basin, is part of the abyssal zone, which plunges down to depths of 4000-6000 meters. Finally, the deep tranches of the hadal zone mark the lowest points on the seafloor, reaching almost 11,000 meters.\nThe deeper zones are quite interesting in that their features are different from what some might expect. The deep ocean basin’s geography is actually quite similar to the features observed on land, though on a much greater scale. From extensive plains to massive mountains, the deep ocean floor may very well seem like a submerged version of our world (only without light and in an extreme cold state). In fact, the earth’s longest mountain range is located below the sea. At over 35,000 miles in length, this incredible mountain range, known as the Mid-Ocean Ridge system, snakes its way around the globe. Furthermore, the deeper benthic zones consist of mud or a form of “ooze” (mud with a high percentage of organic remains) due to the accumulation of pelagic organisms which sink to deeper levels after they die. Sandy habitats are scarce in the deep sea because sand particles, which are created by wave action on coral and rocks at shorelines, are too heavy to be carried by currents to the deep. Benthic areas which are too deep for sediment to stick are instead rocky. These rocky areas can be found on the flanks of islands, seamounts, and rocky banks, as well as on mid-ocean ridges and their rift valleys and some parts of continental slopes. At mid-ocean ridges, where magma often wells up and pushes seafloor tectonic plates apart, even flat surfaces are rocky because they are geologically too new to have accumulated much mud or ooze (as one might expect from these deep areas). There are also unique benthic zones where chemical reactions produce some rather unusual formations. These areas may be relatively rare, but they contain some of the most fascinating species communities in the ocean deep.\nThe living conditions in the deeper ocean levels are truly extreme. In fact, it was long considered that the oceanic depths were simply too harsh to support any life. As a result, the marine world’s icy, dark realms remained unexplored until the 19th century, when European scientists first began to probe the depths of the North Atlantic for any signs of life. Initial sampling suggested that animals did, indeed, inhabit the deeper waters. These fascinating new ideas soon led to the beginnings of modern oceanography when, in response to the samplings, the H.M.S. challenger was commissioned for a great expedition around the world that lasted from 1872 to 1876. The purpose of this grand new journey was to gather data on a wide range of ocean features, including ocean temperatures, seawater chemistry, currents, seafloor geology, and, of course, marine life. The H.M.S. Challenger itself was originally a British Navy corvette (a small warship) which was converted into the first dedicated oceanographic ship complete with its own laboratories, microscopes, and other scientific equipment on board. Leading the expedition were British naturalist John Murray and Scottish naturalist Charles Wyville Thompson. Thompson was among the scientists who dredged interesting new creatures from the ocean depths in the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean Sea, discoveries which persuaded the British government to launch the worldwide Challenger expedition. The Challenger left Portsmouth, England just before the Christmas of 1872. It was well prepared for the crew’s objectives, as the ship contained several different types of samplers to grab rocks or mud from the ocean floor, as well as nets to capture animals from different levels in the ocean. Challenger also had different winches, mechanical engines which were used to lower and hoist sounding lines to measure how deep the currently inhabited waters were. At each sampling station, the crew lowered trawls, nets, and other samplers at several different depths, from the surface down to the seafloor, and then pulled them back onboard where they were able to observe the variety of animals and rocks they acquired.\nWith the tools needed to study the contents of the ocean deep in hand, the crew of the H.M.S. Challenger first traveled south from England to the South Atlantic, and then around the Cape of Good Hope at Africa’s southern tip. From there, the Challenger sailed across the wide and violent seas of the southern Indian Ocean, crossing the Antarctic Circle, and then to Australia and New Zealand. After this, the crew ventured north to the Hawaiian Islands and then south again around Cape Horn, South America’s southern tip where the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans meet. After further exploration of the Atlantic Ocean, the H.M.S. Challenger returned to England in May of 1876. Many great discoveries were made in this 68,890 mile-long expedition. Among these discoveries was one of the deepest parts of the ocean, the Marianas Trench in the western Pacific, where the seafloor is 26,850 feet below the water’s surface (the deepest point in all the oceans, named the Challenger Deep, is actually near where the crew took its sounding and is 37,800 feet deep). This expedition also revealed the first broad outline of the shape of the ocean basin, including the rise in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean that we now know as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The crew was also able to capture and study up to 4700 new species of plants and animals throughout these travels. It is no surprise that with these incredible new observations, the Challenger Expedition encouraged other countries to take interest in the oceans and mount expeditions of their own.","Review and New Material Now that our class has tested… its times to move on BUT…. before we do one last review\nThe World’s Oceans 71% of the Earth’s surface is covered by ocean water. The oceans contain 97% of the earth’s water. All the oceans and seas are actually one continuous body of water.\nOceans The oceans are the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Arctic. The Pacific Ocean is the largest ocean. The area and volume of the Pacific Ocean are greater than the Atlantic and Indian combined.\nWater Cycle The sun’s rays heat the surface of the ocean. The heat causes the water to evaporate. The evaporating water (clean, fresh water) enters the atmosphere as water vapor. The salt remains behind.\nWater Cycle Winds carry water vapor over land. Some of the water vapor condenses to form clouds. The water in the clouds falls as precipitation.\nWater Cycle Some of this water runs into rivers and streams which flow back into the oceans. Some of the water seeps into the soil and rocks become part of the groundwater.\nProperties of Ocean Water Ocean water is a mixture of gases and solids dissolved in pure water. Oceanographers believe oceans contain all the natural elements on Earth. 85 of 90 have been found in the ocean.\nMajor Elements in the Ocean Ocean water is 96% pure water. Chlorine (1.9) and sodium (1.1) make up the next largest concentration of elements. Sodium chloride is table salt.\nSources of Salt in the Ocean When volcanoes erupt, rock materials and gases, such as chlorine, spew forth. As rivers, streams and glaciers move over rock and soil, they dissolve salts, such as magnesium, sodium and potassium, in them. As waves pound the shoreline, they dissolve salts from the rocks.\nSalinity Levels The salinity is lower in areas where freshwater rivers run into the ocean. Salinity levels are also affected by animals such as clams and oysters that use calcium salts to build their shells. They remove salt from the water. In warm ocean areas where there is little rainfall and much evaporation, the amount of dissolved salts is much greater. In polar regions, the salinity levels are high because temperatures are cold enough for ocean water to freeze. Pure water is removed and salts are left behind.\nGases in Ocean Water The most abundant gases in ocean water are nitrogen, carbon dioxide and oxygen. The amounts of these elements vary with depth. They are more abundant at the ocean’s surface where sunlight causes more plant life.\nTemperature of Ocean Water Warm water holds less dissolved gas than cold water. When ocean water is cold, like in polar regions, it sinks and carries oxygen rich water to the ocean depths. As a result, fish and other animals can live in deep parts of the ocean.\nEdges of the Continents The shoreline is a boundary between where the land and the ocean meet. The area where the underwater edge meets of a continent meets the ocean floor is called a continental margin.\nEssential Questions How does Climate and Ocean temperature affect Marine life? What do different Ocean animals need to survive? How do plants and animals adapt to their environments? How does exposure to tides affect life forms?\nOcean Life Zones Intertidal Zone (Splash Zone) Neritic Zone (Continental Shelf) Open Sea Zone – Bathyal (Continental Slope) Abyssal (Ocean floor)\nOcean Life Zones The plant and animal life in the ocean is affected by several factors. One factor is the amount of sunlight that penetrates the ocean. Another factor is the temperature of the ocean water. Water pressure is also a factor.\nMajor Groups of Ocean Life Plants and animals in the ocean are classified into three major groups based on their habits and the depth of the water in which they live. The three major groups are plankton, nekton and benthos.\nUnder the Sea What’s Up ? Hi There YO YO YO!!!\nPlankton Plankton float at or near the surface where sunlight can penetrate. Most of the plankton are very small, such as algae. These organisms drift with the currents or tides. Plankton are the main food for many larger organisms. They account for most of the organisms in the ocean.\nNekton Whales, seals, dolphins, squid octopuses, barracuda and other fish are all nekton. Nekton are free-swimming organisms that feed on other nekton as well as on plankton. Many have adaptations enabling them to function at depths that have great pressure and no light.\nBenthos Organisms that live on the ocean floor are benthos. The forms of these animals include crustaceans and shell fish. The deep bottom environments are sparsely populated with benthos. Some benthos are plants that live on the ocean floor in shallow waters where sun can penetrate.\nOcean Life Zones The classification of the ocean into life zones is based on the conditions in the ocean. These conditions vary widely. The classification includes the intertidal zone, the neritic zone and open-ocean zones.\nIntertidal (Splash) Zone This region is the most changeable in the ocean. Anemones, crabs, clams, mussels and plants such as seaweed live here. They must be able to exist without water for periods of time. They must be able to anchor to keep from being washed out to sea.\nNeritic ( Shelf) Zone This zone extends to a depth of 200 meters and receives plenty of sunlight. The water pressure is low and the temperature is constant. This zone can support plankton, nekton and benthos. Marine life is most abundant here."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9aa4962c-63eb-4300-8f10-73ffedf7fa90>","<urn:uuid:ea45da91-904f-4d93-944e-bc4615ca0779>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How did the water management systems of El Mirador and Tikal compare in terms of sophistication? 🤔","answer":"Both Maya cities demonstrated advanced water management systems, but in different ways. El Mirador used plaster-lined catchment areas to collect water, featuring decorative panels with carved and modeled-lime plaster depicting swimming figures and cosmic monsters. Tikal, on the other hand, had a more technologically advanced filtration system at the Corriental reservoir, using imported crystalline quartz and zeolite materials that could filter out toxins, harmful microbes, nitrogen-rich compounds, and heavy metals - a system that would still be effective today and was created 2,000 years before similar practices were introduced in Europe.","context":["Located in the Central Maya Lowlands in what is now northern Guatemala, the Preclassic city of El Mirador was a giant compared to most of its contemporaries. Its massive ruins still tower above the rainforest canopy. They are silent witnesses to Maya ingenuity and the Maya’s ability to sustain such a massive settlement so early in their history. Agriculture involving the cultivation of corn, beans and squash enabled its inhabitants to thrive.\nManmade plaster-lined catchment areas collected water, making up for the absence of rivers. Even in such apparently mundane aspects of city life, the Maya showed their artistic nature.\nIn March 2009, archaeologists discovered a series of panels made of carved and modeled-lime plaster that lined a water collection system in an area of the city known as the Central Acropolis. The panels and water collection tanks date to the Late Preclassic period, from 300 B.C. to the beginning of our era. The panels, which flank the series of pools in this unique water control system, depict two “swimming” individuals that are framed by cosmic monsters of great importance in ancient Maya art.\nAccording to Dr. Richard Hansen, who led the team of archaeologists at El Mirador: “[T]he ‘swimmers’ represent the Hero Twins of the Popol Vuh.” He is referring to the Quiche Maya text of the Maya creation story, which was found in the highland town of Chichicastenango in A.D. 1700 and transcribed by a Dominican monk named Francisco Ximenez by about 1704 A.D.\nDr. Stephen Houston, who has worked at the neighboring site of El Zotz, says, “These figures represent god impersonators and bear no secure connection to twins in the Popol Vuh.” Instead, he argues,”Perhaps the artists commemorated a narrative of the first rainmakers and their watery assistants. In this way the rulers of El Mirador, through the mechanism of deity impersonation, presented themselves as supernatural agents who controlled the rain.”\nWhat we have here is one of the earliest representations to mythical characters we know from the Popol Vuh. The problem is that there is a huge time gap between this plaster panel and the earliest-known document referencing the Popol Vuh. The Newberry Library’s manuscript of this creation story is one of the most widely known and possibly the earliest surviving copy. It was transcribed between 1700 and 1715 in Chichicastenango, Guatemala, by the Dominican priest Francisco Ximénez. Father Brasseur de Bourbourg published a French translation of the text in1861. Images of the title page and first page of the text of the Ximenez manuscript are also on display. An original print of the latter, dating back to 1861, is currently also on display at our Maya 2012: Prophecy Becomes History exhibit.\nAn alternative interpretation of what we see in the panel is that it illustrates the role of Maya royalty. As intermediaries between our physical world and the supernatural one, Maya rulers were called upon to ensure plentiful rains.\nProponents of either hypothesis have reasons to support their line of thinking. Because there are no inscriptions clearly identifying these characters in the water as either mythical heroes or historical rulers from El Mirador, I would favor a third interpretation: we just do not know who is represented here.\nVisit Maya 2012: Prophecy Becomes History through March 31 and draw your own conclusions.","Mayan discovery: Scientist on unearthing ‘incredible cities’\nThe once-bustling city of Tikal, the Mayan city which dates back as far as 400 BC and was still in its prime in 900 AD, had an extremely effective water filtration system which would stand the tests of today, scientists from the University of Cincinnati (UC) have announced. Researchers discovered that the people of the Mayan city, in what is now Guatemala, had built a system from materials they imported from miles away.\nIt is known as the Corriental reservoir and contains minerals which act as a \"molecular sieve\".\nGeologists and biologists identified crystalline quartz and zeolite, which contain silicon and aluminium that would have helped to filter out the toxins.\nThe filters, according to a statement from UC, would have removed harmful microbes, nitrogen-rich compounds, heavy metals such as mercury and other toxins from the water.\nAccording to the research which was published in the journal Scientific Reports, the filtration system would still be effective today.\nrchaeology news: Ancient Maya built water filtration system which would still be effective TODAY\nThe team state which the Maya created the filtration system 2,000 years before similar practices were introduced to Europe.\nKenneth Barnett Tankersley, associate professor of anthropology and lead author of the study, said: “What’s interesting is this system would still be effective today and the Maya discovered it more than 2,000 years ago.\n“The ancient Maya lived in a tropical environment and had to be innovators. This is a remarkable innovation.\n“A lot of people look at Native Americans in the Western Hemisphere as not having the same engineering or technological muscle of places like Greece, Rome, India or China.\n\"But when it comes to water management, the Maya were millennia ahead.”\nThe discovery of zeolite was particularly interesting to scientists, who note that the chemical reaction sees oxygen atoms create a crystal lattice which has amazing absorption properties.\nThe team said: \"The apparent zeolite filtration system at Tikal's Corriental reservoir is the oldest known example of water purification in the Western Hemisphere and the oldest known use of zeolite for decontaminating drinking water in the world.\"\nAccording to the team, the reservoir was likely used by workers in the field to stay hydrated under the beating heat.\nArchaeology news: Medieval graffiti ‘repelling evil spirits’ unearthed\nArchaeology news: Sacrificed llamas buried ALIVE in Inca ritual\nArchaeology: Medieval 'witch graffiti' unveils 'years of history'\nUC geography professor and co-author Nicholas Dunning said: “It was an exposed, weathered volcanic tuff of quartz grains and zeolite. It was bleeding water at a good rate.\n“Workers refilled their water bottles with it. It was locally famous for how clean and sweet the water was.\n“It was probably through very clever empirical observation that the ancient Maya saw this particular material was associated with clean water and made some effort to carry it back.\n“They had settling tanks where the water would be flowing toward the reservoir before entering the reservoir.\n\"The water probably looked cleaner and probably tasted better, too.\""],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3937137f-7252-4009-b6c1-214d26cba807>","<urn:uuid:3e0be0c3-286c-4565-bc7d-00c02124b589>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How can parents get bilingual programs started at their local library if none currently exist?","answer":"Parents can take several steps to help start bilingual programs at their local library: 1) Talk with the librarian about your interest in bilingual programs. 2) Consider volunteering your language skills and ideas, as many libraries lack bilingual staff but welcome community volunteers. Several libraries across the country successfully use this model - for example, the Kenton County Public Library partners with community volunteers for bilingual cultural celebrations, and the Seattle Public Library trains volunteers to offer storytime programs in various languages. Some libraries also use programs like 'Mother Goose on the Loose en Espanol' where non-Spanish speaking librarians can partner with Spanish-speaking volunteers.","context":["April 30th marks the celebration of Día del Niño/Día del Libro, an annual celebration of children, families and reading held at libraries nationwide. Here at SpanglishBaby, we’re wrapping up a week-long exploration into the world of bilingual homeschooling and the families who are living it. We’ve emphasized this week that one of the biggest hurdles for bilingual homeschoolers is the lack of resources and curriculums available to them. A library with a decent collection of Spanish material can be a treasure for the homeschooling family.\nTo celebrate Día, libraries and bilingual homeschooling we decided to focus on one librarian who has dedicated her career to making libraries a welcoming place to people of all backgrounds and, especially, for Spanish-speaking families and the bilingual community. Katie Cunningham, raised in a small town in the Appalachian foothills of Southeastern Ohio, began studying Spanish in college and admits not really enjoying it at first. After learning Spanish while studying and traveling abroad, she found her niche in libraries.\nBy being able to speak Spanish, she was immediately struck by the fact that Latinos—a huge and growing community of diverse people—are being under-served by many libraries. Katie believes that her experiences abroad made her especially sensitive to the experiences of the new immigrants she was encountering at the library. She realized she wanted to work to make the library a place that felt welcoming.\nAfter finding her blog, Es Divertido Hablar Dos Idiomas, and seeing that she’s developed a presentation to bring Bilingual Storytime into libraries, I contacted her wanting to share her story and applaud her work for our bilingual kids.\nKatie: I am the Children’s Librarian at the Village Branch of the Lexington Public Library in Lexington, KY. The Village Branch is a very special and unique place to work because all of our staff are bilingual (English/Spanish). We serve a diverse neighborhood, and the people who walk through our doors know they will be able to find friendly, helpful service inside from all of our staff. As the Children’s Librarian, I get to do the fun work! My greatest passion is working with families of young children and sharing with parents ways that they (as their child’s first and most important teacher) can use books and other resources to help their children learn the early skills that they need in order to be successful when the time comes to learn to read. One of the ways I do this is through our weekly Bilingual Family Storytime, in which we share stories, songs and activities in both English and Spanish, all intentionally selected to celebrate bilingualism and build early literacy skills.\nSB: Today is the last day of the month-long celebration of Día del Niño/Día del Libro. How did your library celebrate it and why do you think it’s important to do so?\nKatie: Our celebration will be on Saturday, May 1 in order to be more convenient for families to attend. We are hosting a celebration of reading, culture and information throughout the day. We will be having several programs and performances for children of various ages, including a payaso, bilingual storytelling and African drumming. Children will be able to make cultural and literacy based crafts, such as bookmarks and papel picado. Something special and new that we are doing this year is bringing in information for parents as well by hosting a Community Information Fair. Several agencies serving families in our neighborhood are bringing activities or giveaways for children, as well as bilingual information about their services for the families. We will have high school and college volunteers available to translate for any agencies unable to bring bilingual staff. And of course, possibly the most exciting piece of all, every child who attends our event will get to choose his or her very own, brand new book to keep.\nDía is important to celebrate for so many reasons. Most importantly, it is an opportunity to celebrate the joy of reading in all languages! It is a chance to welcome large groups of families into their library to socialize and connect around themes of literacy of books. It also brings diverse groups of people together. At our event this year, high school volunteers will be serving as role models by reading with young children, agencies serving the same community will be together in one place, library staff across different locations are coming to be a part of our event, working with a community they may not ordinarily have the opportunity to serve. Only an event as special and important as Dia can accomplish so much in one day.\nSB: We are also celebrating you for the work you do to promote bilingualism with your Bilingual Storytimes and through your effort to teach other librarians to incorporate it. Why did you start this? Why is it important?\nKatie: I really kind of fell into my career by accident, and I am so grateful for all the things that have led me to this place because I cannot imagine doing anything else. When I first began working in libraries, it became immediately obvious that there is a tremendous need for bilingual staff and services, yet libraries (like other organizations) struggle to hire and retain bilingual staff. I learned how to do early literacy-based storytimes, and had the opportunity to incorporate Spanish and develop a Bilingual Storytime program. The results were incredible! Children’s faces would light up hearing and sharing in the blend of English and Spanish. One of my favorite memories is sharing Let’s Eat / A comer by Pat Mora and hearing a boy call out, “we eat frijoles at my house!” Bilingual storytime is a wonderful way to celebrate diversity, culture and language, and I believe all of those things are important for libraries to embrace. We must reflect the communities we serve.\nHowever, in discussing my work, I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the work of so many others who have come before me. I am extremely fortunate to be working in a completely bilingual library at a time when publishers are finally making available high-quality bilingual books for children. None of this could have come to be without the passion, vision and perseverance of others. A great many librarians, authors and advocates have done tremendous work to make it possible to celebrate bilingualism and multiculturalism in our libraries today.\nSB: We find that libraries are treasure troves for parents raising bilinguals, but even a more special resource for those who are homeschooling their children bilingually. How can homeschoolers take full advantage of the library and its bilingual programs?\nKatie: Talk with your librarian! One of the reasons why I love this field is that we are a profession of people who believe in sharing! If there is something you need but cannot find, just ask! Most libraries participate in inter-library loan or consortium projects, which means that we can find and get for you nearly any book you want, even if we don’t own it. Or, if you suggest us a title, we may even be able to add it to our collection! Also, in this day and age, libraries are not just about books. Librarians are seekers of information in all its forms. Need an article, a website, or a database? We’ll find it for you! And if we can’t, we will put you in touch with someone who can.\nSB: What tips can you give parents who don’t have these special bilingual programs in their local libraries to get them started?\nKatie: Again, talk with your librarian. Keep in mind, that it is entirely possible that your library has wanted to begin a bilingual program of some sort, but has felt unable to do so because they do not have bilingual staff. This is a tough issue for libraries. So, if you are interested in having bilingual programs, consider sharing your skills and ideas as a volunteer. Many libraries across the country utilize community volunteers to offer bilingual programs they do not have staff resources to provide. Examples include:\n- The Kenton County Public Library in northern Kentucky which has partnered with community volunteers to offer bilingual cultural celebrations for years.\n- Betsy Diamant-Cohen out of Baltimore has developed an early literacy based lapsit program for babies that is available to do bilingually, called “Mother Goose on the Loose en Espanol.” By partnering with Spanish speaking community volunteers, Children’s Librarians who do not speak Spanish can offer this program.\n- The Seattle Public Library also partners with community volunteers whom they train to offer storytime programs in many world languages."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:277a81a9-1a94-4cd2-897f-abdeb6832aa7>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Which career paths can you pursue with education in global public health vs human nutrition specifically? Looking to make a career choice!","answer":"Education in global public health prepares professionals to work in global arrangements, international health organizations, and address worldwide health challenges, particularly focusing on management, policy implementation, and research. In contrast, the Human Nutrition concentration specifically prepares students for careers dealing with international and domestic challenges in public health nutrition, with an additional option to become a Registered Dietitian through their dietitian program. The Human Nutrition program particularly emphasizes theoretical knowledge and scientific skills for addressing nutrition challenges, as evidenced by faculty work in maternal, infant, and child nutrition, micronutrient deficiencies, and food access issues.","context":["by improving education and training\nof public health professionals\nfor both practice and research\nWORKING GROUP ON EDUCATION FOR GLOBAL PUBLIC HEALTH\nEducation for Global Public Health\nA regionalized even fragmented world – as it was – is converging rapidly in our days at the beginning of the 21st century. Countries embark increasingly on global arrangements (like e.g. the World Trade Organisation) and a globalizing civil society – supported by mobile technologies - connects across borders. At the same time unprecedented waves of migration diversify the Northern societies and deplete the qualified workforce in the South. Social disruption, military conflict, and climate change create increasingly a 90/10 situation where 90% of the global disease burden affects the South but only 10% of the world’s resources are available there. To really change this state of affairs we have to think new and to try new avenues (Panter-Brick et al., 2014). A recent publication attempts to define Academic Global Health as relevant for training and research (Didier et al. 2016).\nThe World Federation of Public Health Associations published early in 2016 a Global Charter for the Public’s Health (WFPHA, 2016). Europe as a privileged region also shares responsibility beyond its continental borders. In the ASPHER Charter (ASPHER, 2013) on ‘The global dimension of education and training for public health in the 21st century in Europe and in the world’ it is underlined that “The implementation of effective and sustainable interventions for health is a long-term endeavour where much depends on reliable global partnership, as noted in MDG 8. We, the Schools of Public Health in Europe, accept our global responsibility, which is guided by the two key principles of Solidarity and Subsidiarity. We act as part of the international community, focusing on education for practice and research to contribute to the global public goods essential for health, the building block for our future...Both education and research are core composite parts in the development of globalization, with international students numbering 2.5 million globally and constituting 20.5% of the total enrolment of the European Schools of Public Health. Global health is an emerging topic of highest relevance in the academic public health curricula.”\nIn conclusion a defined professional public health workforce with global experience and leadership qualification is required.\nAll professionals in the ASPHER community are welcome.

{"question":"Can you explain why do we must analyze purpose before creating mockups or information architecture?","answer":"In both mockup creation and information architecture development, analyzing purpose is crucial. For mockups, you must first understand the business problem or opportunity that necessitates a new screen or interface. Similarly, in information architecture, you need to determine the mission or purpose by asking why people will use it and what their immediate and long-range goals are. This initial analysis helps ensure the design effectively addresses user needs and business requirements, whether it's solving a specific business problem or meeting user objectives.","context":["How to Create a Mockup of a Prototype for Your Business Analysis Report\nNot all business analysts are screen designers, so you may find creating a mockup a bit challenging. In fact, a field of study called human factors engineering concentrates entirely on the interface between man and machine, which clues you in to how complex it can be.\nIf you can’t consult a human factors engineer, use the best-in-class applications as your base. For example, if you’re designing a music download application, look to Apple’s iTunes as a best-in-class application.\nHere’s how you go about creating a mockup:\nAsk why before you even start creating a mockup.\nThat the business requested a new screen or a new interface means that it is experiencing a problem that prevents it from doing the business or wants to be able to take advantage of an opportunity. You have to figure that purpose out.\nDetermine the number of mockups you have to create by identifying where you need interfaces.\nHere are some guidelines:\nLook at your use case diagram. Every association line that crosses the automation boundary in the diagram requires a user interface that you have to mockup.\nReference your workflow diagrams. Tasks that require a user to perform them within the system require a user interface.\nLook at your storyboard. Each rectangle on the storyboard is a screen.\nReference your entity tables or workflow diagrams to find the data you need on the screen of the interface.\nThis info may be data displayed to the user or entered by the user when interacting with the system.\nDraw a rough mockup on paper, in Visio, on a whiteboard, or with a specialized tool.\nTalk with the application development team about screen interface standards, feasibility, and design ideas.\nRevise the design based on feedback from the stakeholders.\nAt this point, you need to complete the UI specification, which is a set of two tables — field descriptions and screen controls — that explains the details of the appearance of the screen and how everything interacts and behaves with the user.\n|Name||The name of the item as it appears on the screen|\n|Type||The type of the on-screen item, such a label, selection box, or drop-down list|\n|Source||Where the data comes from (info that may identify other interfaces)|\n|Description||A description of the field|\n|Length||How long the data field is (used to compare interfaces to see whether data is getting cut off or whether a piece of data can fit within the field)|\n|Defaults||What the field defaults to if no information is given|\n|Req./opt.||Whether the field is required or optional|\n|Rules||The business rules that surround this field (may be an actual rule or a cross-reference to a rule table elsewhere in the requirements package)|\n|Name||Name of the control as documented on the screen (enables a cross-reference to what is on the mockup)|\n|Control type||What the control is (radio button, button, text box, hyperlink, and so on) and how it behaves|\n|Function description||What happens when users interact (click on a hyperlink, hover over a button, or whatever) with this control (provides detail information about the experience users will have with the system)|\n|Enable/disable||When the button is enabled (whether it’s always available to be clicked on or only enables after certain fields are filled in)|\n|Rules||The business rules surrounding this field (may be an actual rule or a cross-reference to a rule table elsewhere in the requirements package)|","When it comes to the user experience it’s not the technical infrastructure or the storage system we are interested in. We focus on the structure of the information we share with the user and how this content is organized, labeled and visualized.\nWe define what data should be displayed and how the different pages of information is linked to each other.\nThe easiest ways to begin this process is to define a site map; This allows us to group pages together and helps determine the best structure to present them.\n“It’s very important to understands how people actually use content and how the structure should function to support that.”\nOne of the challenges for the UX designer is to find the right set of relationships between items and categories. This provides menus, links, buttons and other navigational structures to deliver a good user experience.\nSome of the techniques that can be used for this part are card sorting, user surveys, together with other user research.\nSometimes there’s the tricky problem to incorporate these in to existing taxonomies, already defined for other systems.\nThis may involve a careful examination of the existing taxonomy to ensure that menus, boxes, links, etc. can fully represent each taxonomy clearly without squashing data or omitting it entirely.\nTeamwork gives an advantages\nWhen a Back-End Developer and a UX-designer works together they have the ability to match technical/system limitations to the user’s needs and achieve a “best fit” between these two. All for an improved user experience if the perfect experience isn’t quite feasible.\nSteps to developing an intuitive information architecture:\n- Find out what the mission or purpose is: why will people come to use this?\n- Determine the immediate and long-range goals: are they different?\n- Pinpoint the intended audiences and conduct a requirements analysis for each group.\n- Collect content and develop a content inventory.\n- Determine the organizational structure\n- Create an outline of the project, which can include:\n- Content Inventory: a hierarchical view of the content, typically in a spreadsheet format, which briefly describes the content that should appear on each page and indicates where pages belong in terms of global and local navigation.\n- Site Maps: visual diagrams that reflect site navigation and main content areas. They are usually constructed to look like flowcharts and show how users will navigate from one section to another.\n- Create a visual blueprint, which can include:\n- Wireframes: rough illustrations of page content and structure, which may also indicate how users will interact. These diagrams get handed off to a visual designer, who will establish page layout and visual design. Wireframes are useful for communicating early design ideas and inform the designer and the client of exactly what information, links, content, promotional space, and navigation will be on every page. Wireframes may illustrate design priorities in cases where various types of information appear to be competing.\n- Define the navigation systems:\n- Global navigation: Global navigation is the primary means of navigation. Global navigation links appear on every page, typically as a menu.\n- Local navigation: Local links may appear as text links within the content of a page or as a submenu for a section.\n- Utility links: Utility links appear in the header or footer of every page. These may include infrequently used links.\n- Conduct user research:\n- Once you have a draft navigation structure, conduct appropriate usability research to collect feedback from the target audience. Methods may include: Card Sorting, Cognitive Walkthroughs, prototyping, Contextual Task Analyses, and Usability Testing.\nTips for creating usable navigational systems:\n- Be easy to learn.\n- Be consistent throughout the website.\n- Provide feedback, e.g. such as the use of breadcrumbs to indicate how to navigate back to where the user started.\n- Use the minimum number of clicks to arrive at the next destination.\n- Use clear and intuitive labels, based on the user’s perspective and terminology.\n- Support user tasks.\n- Have each link be distinct from other links.\n- Group navigation into logical units.\n- Avoid making the user scroll to get to important navigation or submit buttons.\n- Not disable the browser’s back button.\nSource: Own experience and Interaction Design Foundation, https://www.interaction-design.org"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1b893087-ed15-4040-b30d-3e83a66df47e>","<urn:uuid:db60a004-8de2-414d-85ae-787149a801b5>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the health challenges Golden Retrievers face with cancer, and how can clinical trials help address these issues? 🐕 Need detailed info for my furry friend! ","answer":"Golden Retrievers are particularly prone to cancer, which is the leading cause of death in dogs over 10 years. Cancer in dogs involves uncontrolled cell growth that can spread to other parts of the body through metastasis. Clinical trials at institutions like Purdue University Veterinary Teaching Hospital offer potential benefits for dogs with cancer, including access to new therapies that may be more effective than existing treatments. These trials allow dogs to live at home while receiving treatment, and the cost is often lower than traditional treatments. The trials are designed to minimize side effects and maintain good quality of life for the dogs. Additionally, participation in clinical trials contributes to advancing cancer understanding and treatment for both dogs and potentially humans.","context":["November is Canine Cancer Awareness month and in honor of sweet Bella the Golden Retriever who has been stricken with Canine Lymphoma, I chose to feature the Golden Retriever this week, along with some important information about Canine Cancer. Below information from http://www.caninecancer.com/\nWhat is Cancer?\nDog cancer, like human cancer, is the uncontrolled growth of cells on or within the body. Although there are many types of cancer, they all start because of out-of-control growth of abnormal cells. Normal body cells grow, divide, and die in an orderly fashion. During the early years of a dog's life, normal cells divide more rapidly until the dog becomes an adult. After that, cells in most parts of the body divide only to replace worn-out or dying cells and to repair injuries. Because cancer cells continue to grow and divide, they are different from normal cells. Instead of dying, they outlive normal cells and continue to form new abnormal cells.\nCancerous tumors can spread to other parts of the body where they begin to grow and replace normal tissue. This process is called metastasis. For example, breast cancer that spreads to the liver is still called breast cancer, not liver cancer. Regardless of where a cancer may spread, however, it is always named for the place it began.Not all tumors are cancerous. Benign (noncancerous) tumors do not spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body and, with very rare exceptions, are not life threatening.Different types of cancer can behave very differently. For example, bone cancer and breast cancer are very different diseases. They grow at different rates and respond to different treatments. That is why dogs with cancer need treatment that is aimed at their particular kind of cancer.Cancer rates increase in dogs with age. It is the leading cause of death in dogs over 10 years.\nIf cancer is suspected in your dog, a veterinarian may order x-rays, blood tests, ultrasounds. A biopsy (the removal of a piece of tissue) is frequently performed for confirmation that cancer exists and to determine the level of severity from benign to aggressively malignant (called grading).\nWe do not know how dogs get cancer most of the time. There are many types of cancer and many possible causes of cancer (chemicals in our environment, sun exposure, assorted viruses and infections). There are important genetic factors as well. Feeding your dog a healthy diet and keeping them away from known carcinogens will help. Spaying or neutering your dog will also reduce their risk for developing certain cancers.\nEach diagnosis of cancer requires individual care and treatment planning. Conventional treatment may include a combination of treatment therapies such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, cryosurgery (freezing), hyperthermia (heating) or immunotherapy.Complementary and alternative veterinary medicine (CAVM) therapies include acupuncture, behavior modification, homeopathy, herbal medicine, mega-nutrient augmentation therapy, nutritional therapy and chiropractic therapy. Once diagnosed, your veterinarian will discuss the best treatment option(s) for your dog. In some instances, your veterinarian may refer you to a board-certified oncologist (cancer specialist) depending upon the recommended course of treatment. It never hurts to get a second opinion and to research clinical trials for which you dog may be eligible.\nTreatment success depends upon the type and extent of the cancer, as well as the aggressiveness of therapy. Some cancers can be cured and almost all patients can be helped to some degree.Another critical point is to understand exactly what is meant when data on efficacy of treatment is presented. Useful terms include:Median - this is used in the context of survival, a median survival of three months means that 50% of the animals are alive at three months, but 50% have died. It does not give you any information of the range of survival of individuals from within the group. For example, individual animals may have survived for only a day to several years. A median survival is very useful to allow comparison between different types of treatment.Survival means just that: how long an animal stayed alive, usually from time of diagnosis, but it could also mean from time of treatment, or from time the owner first noticed signs of a problem. It does not give you any information on what the animal's quality of life was during that time.Progression free survival is the time the animal survived without progression of the clinical signs. This gives you a better idea of the quality of life.\nCommon Cancer Terms\nCancer: any malignant, cellular tumor; cancers are divided into two broad categories of carcinoma and sarcomas.\nNeoplasm: an abnormal new growth of tissue in animals or plants; a tumorTumor: 1.) a swelling; a cardinal sign of inflammation. 2.) neoplasm: a new growth of tissue in which cell multiplication is uncontrolled and progressive.\nBenign tumor: one lacking the properties of invasion and metastasis and showing a lesser degree of abnormal cellularity than do malignant tumors. These are usually surrounded by a fibrous capsule.\nMalignant tumor: has the properties of invasion and metastasis and displays cells with widely varying characteristicsCarcinoma: a malignant growth made up of epithelial cells tending to infiltrate surrounding tissues and gives rise to metastases.\nSarcoma: a malignant tumor originating from connective tissue or blood or lymphatic tissues.\nMetastasize: spread throughout the body, of cancer cells\nGrowth: can refer to any kind of an abnormal increase in size of tissue\nLump: can be a growth or fluid filled cyst or any structure raising above the normal surface of a tissue plane.\nAbout the Golden Retriever\nThe Golden Retriever is a sturdy, medium-large sized dog. The skull is broad and the muzzle is straight, tapering slightly with a well defined stop. The nose is black or a brownish black. The teeth meet in a scissors bite. The medium to large eyes are dark brown. The relatively short ears hang down close to the cheeks. When pulled forward the tip of the ear should just cover the eye. The tail is thick at the base with feathering along the underside. Dewclaws may be removed. The water-resistant coat is dense with a firm, straight, or wavy outer coat. There is an untrimmed feathering on the underbelly, back of the legs, front of the neck and underside of the tail. Coat color comes in cream to a rich golden.\nThese are lovable, well-mannered, intelligent dogs with a great charm. They are easily trained, and always patient and gentle with children. Charming, devoted and self-assured, they are a popular family dog. Energetic and loving, Golden Retrievers enjoy pleasing their masters, so obedience training can be very rewarding. They excel in competitions. Friendly with everyone, including other dogs, the Golden Retriever has very little, if any, guarding instincts. While unlikely to attack, Goldens make good watchdogs, loudly signaling a stranger's approach. This breed needs to be around people who display leadership to be happy. The Golden Retriever may become destructive and/or high-strung, over-exuberant and distractible if he is lacking in daily mental and physical exercise. Be sure to remain this dogs firm, but calm, confident, consistent pack leader to avoid behavioral issues. Some of the Golden's talents are hunting, tracking, retrieving, narcotics detection, agility, competitive obedience, and performing tricks. These dogs also love to swim.\nHeight: Dogs 22-24 inches (56-61cm.) Bitches 20-22 inches (51-56cm.)\nWeight: Dogs 60-80 pounds (27-36kg.) Bitches 55-70 pounds (25-32kg.)\nProne to cancer, hip dysplasia, Von Willebrand's disease, heart problems and congenital eye defects. Skin allergies are common in Golden Retrievers and often require veterinary attention. Gains weight easily, do not overfeed.\nThe Golden Retriever needs to be taken on a daily, brisk, long walk, jog or run alongside you when you bicycle, where the dog is made to heel beside or behind the person holding the lead, as instinct tells a dog that the leader leads the way and that leader needs to be the human. In addition, they like to retrieve balls and other toys. Be sure to exercise this dog well to avoid hyper activity.\nAbout 10-12 years\nThe smooth, medium-haired double coat is easy to groom. Comb and brush with a firm bristle brush, paying particular attention to the dense undercoat. Dry shampoo regularly, but bathe only when necessary. This breed is an average shedder.\nOriginating in the Scottish Highlands in the late 1800s, the Golden Retriever was developed by Lord Tweedmouth, by crossing the original yellow Flat-Coated Retriever, with the now extinct Tweed Water Spaniel. He later crossed in the bloodhound, Irish Setter, and more Tweed Water Spaniel. The dogs were called the Golden Flat-Coat and only later were they given the name Golden Retriever.","Clinical Trials in Dogs with Cancer: Frequently Asked Questions\nWhat is a clinical trial, and why are clinical trials important?\nA clinical trial is a study in dogs in which the safety and beneficial effects of a new cancer treatment are determined. Other clinical trials focus on new ways to detect cancer more effectively. Clinical trials are different from laboratory animal studies in that the participating dogs are pet dogs that have naturally-occurring cancer, and the dogs are receiving a treatment that is expected to be as effective as or better than other drugs at treating the cancer. Dogs participating in clinical trials live at home with their families and come into the Purdue University Veterinary Teaching Hospital (PUVTH) periodically for evaluation and treatment. Clinical trials are crucially important because this is the best way to learn how to detect and treat cancer more effectively. The benefits are expected to apply to the individual dog, to future dogs with cancer, and potentially to human cancer patients. Although much progress has been made in treating and preventing cancer, more progress is still needed!\nWhat is involved for my dog if he or she participates in a clinical trial?\nThe diagnosis of cancer is based on a tissue biopsy that is collected and analyzed to determine if the dog has cancer, and if so, what type of cancer. If the diagnosis of cancer is made, the dog owner can talk to their regular veterinarian and to a staff member or veterinarian in the Purdue Comparative Oncology Program (PCOP) to find out if their dog could be eligible for a clinical trial at Purdue University. Additional tests may be needed to see if the dog could be enrolled in a trial, and to confirm that the clinical trial is the best option for the individual dog. The dog owner has to provide informed consent for the dog to participate in the trial. Once the dog is enrolled in a clinical trial, he/she will be evaluated periodically at the PUVTH. Depending on the specific trial, the treatments could involve oral medicines given by the pet owner at home, or medications administered at the PUVTH or by the primary care veterinarian in the dog’s home town. It is important to point out that clinical trials are much different from experimental laboratory animal research. The dogs live at home other than the periodic visits to the PUVTH. The treatments are selected and the trial designed with the goal to minimize risk of side effects and to maintain good quality of life for the dog. All clinical trials are approved by the Purdue Animal Care and Use Committee.\nWhat types of clinical trials are available for pets with cancer at the Purdue?\nThe PCOP is focusing research efforts in two types of cancer in dogs: invasive bladder cancer (transitional cell carcinoma, TCC) and canine lymphoma. At any given time, there are usually multiple ongoing clinical trials for dogs with these cancers at the PUVTH. Periodically, clinical trials are available for pets with other cancers as well. Our veterinary neurology colleagues also are conducting clinical trials in brain cancer in dogs. Please see below for contact information if you have questions regarding clinical trials available for your pet with cancer.\nWhat are the benefits to enrolling my dog in a clinical trial?\nThere are several benefits to enrolling your dog in a clinical trial at the PUVTH. First, the trial may allow your dog to receive treatment with a new cancer therapy that is more effective than existing therapies, or it may help your dog after other therapies are no longer effective. Second, by enrolling your dog in a clinical trial, you and your dog are making a contribution towards advancing our understanding of cancer. This will lead to better diagnostic tests and improved therapies for pet dogs with cancer and potentially people with cancer. Because certain types of cancer are extremely similar between dogs and humans, successful results in dog studies can ultimately lead to benefits for humans too. An additional benefit for a dog participating in a clinical trial, is the treatment is often less expensive than other treatments. Depending on the level of funding, the trial may provide financial support that covers part or all of the cost of treating your pet’s cancer as long as the dog is in the clinical trial.\nAre there risks involved with my dog participating in a clinical trial?\nThere are many advantages to a dog participating in a clinical trial. The main “unknown” is it has not yet been proven that the new treatment will be effective and safe as expected. For a given trial, the veterinarian will discuss with the dog owner what is currently known about the new treatment, why it is expected to be beneficial, and what the known risks are. There may be, however, risks, i.e. side effects, that have not yet been seen, but which could occur. Dogs in a clinical trial will be monitored closely for any side effects, and the treatment adjusted or discontinued should it not be well tolerated. If the dog’s quality of life is not good on a given treatment, the veterinarian will discuss other treatment options with the dog owner. These other options could be part of a study or may be therapies available off study. In addition, a pet owner can withdraw their dog from a study at any time if they wish to do so.\nWhat is a biopsy?\nTo participate in a clinical trial at the PUVTH, the diagnosis of the cancer must be made by a tissue biopsy examined by a veterinary pathologist. There are many types of cancer and many non-cancerous conditions that can look similar to the naked eye, and even with examination of cells from a mass. Therefore a tissue biopsy is crucial to confirm the type of tumor present in order to select the best treatment and to confirm that the clinical trial would be potentially beneficial to the dog. A biopsy is required prior to enrollment of your pet in a cancer-related clinical trial at Purdue.\nMost biopsies are performed with the dog under general anesthesia or heavy sedation. There are many methods for performing a biopsy, and the method used varies according to the location of the tumor in the dog’s body. For dogs with bladder cancer, a biopsy is often performed using a specialized instrument called a cystoscope. A cystoscope is a long, thin, tube-shaped instrument with a camera on the end of it, which is used to nonsurgically obtain biopsy samples from tumors inside the bladder and urethra. This procedure is described in further detail on our website. For dogs with lymphoma, a small surgical incision is made over one of the lymph nodes affected by the cancer and a small wedge-shaped piece of tissue is removed from the affected lymph node. Biopsy procedures are generally very well-tolerated by pets with cancer, and most pets experience minimal to no side effects or complications related to the procedure.\nWhat is a necropsy?\nA necropsy in a dog is similar to an autopsy in a human. Briefly the body and tissues are examined after the dog has died. Tissue samples are removed and examined by the pathologists. Permission to perform a necropsy is requested when a dog in a clinical trial dies or is euthanized due to poor quality of life from the cancer or other conditions. The information learned can be extremely useful in determining how well the treatment had worked, how and why the cancer was progressing (if it was growing), and if any adverse effects from therapy had occurred. In fact, the information from a necropsy is so important, that we often ask owners of dogs with bladder cancer and lymphoma to allow a necropsy even if the dog was not in a clinical trial. The necropsy can be completed and then cremation performed, or the dog owner can take the dog’s body for burial. If a dog owner does not want a necropsy performed, due to any reason, then the procedure will not be done.\nWho can I contact for more information about clinical trials at Purdue for my dog with cancer?\nIf you would like more information about a clinical trial, or if you have questions, please contact the following staff members concerning clinical trials at the PUVTH:\n- For questions regarding clinical trials related to canine bladder cancer, please contact Ms. Patty Bonney or Ms. Lindsey Fourez at (765) 494-1107 or (765) 494-1130.\n- For questions regarding clinical trials related to canine lymphoma, please contact Ms. Sarah Lahrman at (765) 494-1107 or (765) 494-1130.\n- For general questions on clinical trials at the PUVTH, please contact Ms. Becky Bierman at (765) 496-9715."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5a34e673-0b00-4bf7-8e66-834f2b85641b>","<urn:uuid:28b1386d-2cb4-4ff2-bdd4-c1566b8b7c0f>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do chemicals in food and workplace pressures both affect human health? This is seriously concerning! 😢","answer":"Chemicals in food affect health through various mechanisms - while some natural chemicals like solanine in potatoes can be harmful, their impact depends on concentration levels. Other natural chemicals like sodium benzoate in cranberries or glutamic acid in proteins are actually common and necessary components of food. Regarding workplace pressures, particularly in accounting, they significantly impact health with one-third of professional accountants experiencing daily stress. This stress has led to damaged personal relationships (61% of accountants), weight gain (27%), and inability to maintain hobbies (37%). Both chemical exposure through food and workplace stress can thus have substantial effects on physical and mental well-being.","context":["Food Chemistry: “Natural” Doesn’t Always Mean “Good”\nDo you know that cucumber bumps contain poison? Actually, most of the natural products we eat are not as harmless as we believe them to be. It is just that in the course of their evolution, they failed to learn to escape from the meanest predator - the human being. Sergei Belkov - chemical engineer, flavourist , and blogger - explains why everything that we eat is chemistry, and there’s no use in seeking to use “natural” products only.\nNatural food lovers and those who protest against the use of chemicals in food production often demand to hear “the truth” about food - which, they believe, mostly has to do with learning about the content of chemicals in food products.\nRecently, the science journal Chemistry gave an answer to their question - they’ve researched all products and made a list of those that don’t contain any chemicals. By the way, it was quite an easy task, as the list is empty - any food consists of chemicals.\nDNA molecules are the basis of all life on the planet. And even its name indicates that it is a “chemical” molecule, and everything that happens in it is the result of particular chemical reactions. We all consist of different “chemicals”, and numerous chemical processes occur in our bodies every moment. Therefore, there’s no sense in believing in the numerous myths about the horrible “chemical foods”. Still, that doesn’t mean that you can eat just anything - there are lots of different chemicals, and some are definitely harmful. To get a better grasp of what you can eat and what you’d better avoid, it is better to learn why certain chemicals are added into food products. Let’s take a look at several examples.\nWe all know that cucumbers are good for our health, as they contain lots of vitamins and water. Yet, few know that cucumber bumps also contain a strong poison that protects them from insects, as well as strong agents that attract parasitic wasps.\nChips are bad for you, that’s common knowledge. Those even barely interested in the subject know that chips are unhealthy because they contain glutamate, flavoring agents, and other chemical components. Also, every kind of chip contains toxic solanine. Yet, one should take note that it is not the presence of harmful substances that affects a product’s “harmfulness” the most, but their concentration. If we compare the harmful effect of solanine, glutamate and flavoring agents in chips with regard to their concentration, it will turn out that the most harmful ingredient are the very potatoes that chips are made of - their most “organic” and “natural” component. So, it turns out that “artificial” additives are less harmful to a human being.\nThis is a great example of how a “harmful preserving agent” is used by nature itself. Cranberries contain sodium benzoate, which prevents mold and bacteria from eating them. In the process of evolution, the plant “learned” to produce acid which is now one of its components, so people started to use this property to their own ends. And this has nothing to do with sodium benzoate being harmful or healthy.\nMany believe that a handful of almonds can poison a person. Also, some say that when you smell almond you should run, as this means there’s hydrocyanic acid somewhere nearby. Truth is, almonds, as well as apples, cherries, peaches and some other plants really produce hydrocyanic acid, which they use to protect themselves. As hydrocyanic acid is quite reactive and toxic, plants don’t store it as molecules but process it into glycoside that can break down back into the acid. When you eat almonds, you eat the glycoside it contains, and only then it degrades into hydrocyanic acid and aldehyde. By the way, it is the aldehyde that smells like almonds, so artificial almond flavoring does not contain the harmful acid.\nMany believe that vanilla fragrance is the plant’s “natural” smell, yet green vanilla pods don’t smell like that, as they don’t contain vanillin. What is more, vanillin’s true purpose is to protect the seeds from vermin, not to add flavor to pastry - so you should know that this substance is by no means a healthy one.\nActually, there’s no such thing as the smell of coffee in wild nature, as green coffee does not smell. The smell we all know is the result of the beans’ thermal treatment in most unnatural conditions; the same unnatural process is responsible for producing most of the drink’s components, as the natural components are processed into the different substances you then enjoy. Much like cigarettes, so to say. One can say that coffee consists 100% of insecticides and artificial flavouring agents.\nAnother interesting fact is that when we say that all natural plants are “healthy”, we are wrong. Most tend to protect themselves with different chemical compounds. In a sense, we are eating most natural foods not because they are tasty, but because certain plants failed to develop the means of protection against us. In fact, the most tasty and healthy plants that emerged in the process of evolution are long eaten, and what we have left are their more harmful and poisonous relatives.\nThe assertion that all that’s natural is good for us is not exactly true. About a hundred years ago, English philosopher George Edward Moore introduced the idea of the so-called \"naturalistic fallacy\". Simply put, it states that there’s no reasonable basis to identify natural things something “good” and artificial things as something “bad”. “Natural and artificial” and “good and bad” are entirely different categories that we can’t compare. There are lots of natural things that we deem “bad”. There are lots of artificial things that are good for us. This is why when talking about chemistry and food, we are to concern ourselves with whether some molecule is harmful or harmless, not whether it is “natural” or not.\nLet’s try to take a look at a common lemon from this point of view. We can say that it consists of ascorbic acid, starch, сіtric acid, ether oil, saccharose and water. On the other hand, we can also say that those are the antioxidant, acidity regulator, flavouring agent, sweeting agent, stabilizer and medium. In all but their name, those would be the same things, the same molecules.\nEveryone has heard that food additives with the E number are harmful. Yet, by every means the E number has to be the last thing to scare a consumer. The logic here is that if a component is included in the list of approved components only if it was thoroughly researched, and there is nothing to worry about.\nGlutamate is yet another thing they scare you with. Still, if we were to remove everything containing glutamate from the shelves of supermarkets, there would be only water, salt, sugar and starch left. There are no other products that don’t contain glutamate. How so? Everyone knows what hemoglobin is; it is a protein that’s present in all of us. Proteins are made of amino acids, and glutamic acid is the one that is present in almost every protein there is. Milk protein contains up to 20% of glutamic acid, wheat protein - up to 40%. Glutamic acid is amongst the most widespread in nature, also, it is responsible for one of the five basic tastes - umami. Tasting glutamic acid means that the product contains protein. So, when we’re eating quark that is rich in milk protein, we get a lot more glutamic acid than when we’re eating chips that are said to contain too much glutamate.\nAspartame is yet another undeservedly vilified substance. When its molecule comes in contact with water, it degrades into asparagic acid, phenylalanine, and methanol. The latter is indeed a poison. Still, to start talking about the possible hazards, one should first know of its concentration, and understand its effects. Methanol itself is quite harmless, it is the products of methanol degradation (like formaldehyde and such) that are harmful. Therefore, the presence of a substance in some product doesn’t always mean that its concentration is enough to harm you.","Professional accountants stressed out by workplace pressures\nSurvey says stress affecting personal relationships, health and more\nTORONTO, May 13, 2019 – One in three professional accountants feel stressed on a daily basis, according to a new study by a wellbeing organization supported by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW). The accounting profession is in the grip of a mental health crisis, with professional accountants grappling with workplace pressures and rising industry stress levels. Just two per cent of respondents surveyed reported no stress at all.\nThe Chartered Accountants’ Benevolent Association (CABA) is a charity that provides lifelong support largely to past and present members and their families, including emotional and physical wellbeing. It was established in 1886, six years after the formation of the ICAEW, in 1880. Whilst CABA works in partnership with the ICAEW, it is independent and all communication is confidential.\nNearly two-fifths (37%) of survey respondents said their job was the main cause of their stress, while a third (29%) cited the difficulty of trying to maintain a work-life blend. Driving this issue home, two-fifths (38%) check their emails outside work every day, and a third (33%) even check their emails while sick or on annual leave.\nKelly Freehan, service director, CABA, explains: “While a certain degree of pressure can help with motivation, if stress levels are excessive, we risk becoming less productive or burning out. With our research finding that many chartered accountants feel their workloads are so severe that they need to constantly check their emails outside work, it’s clear that firms should be actively encouraging their staff to maintain a healthier work-life blend.”\nMental health and wellbeing has been the focus of several articles in Canadian Accountant. Chartered professional accountants looking for ways to cut workplace mental health costs have been instrumental in the development of the National Standard of Canada for Psychological Health and Safety in the Workplace. We have also published articles on mindfulness and meditation for accountants.\nSome CPA organizations provide health and wellbeing resources to their members. CPA Alberta, for example, offers CPA Assist, Alberta’s CPA Assistance and Wellness Program.\nCABA’s new “mental wellbeing” campaign, however, is unique in its scope. Featuring a dedicated microsite, the campaign will provide support and advice to empower members of the ICAEW chartered accountant community to take greater care of their mental wellbeing.\nAccording to CABA, there are various pressures within the workplace itself, which many accountants are grappling with on a regular basis and are sure to contribute to the rising industry stress levels. The research found that the most commonly felt workplace frustrations include:\n- being overworked (41%)\n- office politics (33%)\n- feeling undervalued (29%)\n- failure to increase pay or rewards (29%)\n- having to attend too many meetings (28%)\nA fifth (21%) of respondents cited money as the main cause of stress, though this was of greater concern to younger and middle-aged respondents than it was to their older colleagues. A quarter (24%) of 18-34-year-olds and a third (32%) of 35-44-year-olds report money being their main source of stress. This was in comparison to just 1-in-10 (10%) 45-54-year olds and fewer than a fifth (17%) of those aged over 55.\nThe research actually found that younger and middle-aged chartered accountants are likely to feel more stressed overall than their older colleagues. More than two fifths of 18-34-year-olds (43%) and 35-44-year-olds (45%) report feeling stressed every day, compared with just 13% of 45-54-year olds and 15% of those aged over 55.\nSays Freehan: “It’s particularly concerning to see that so many young people within the industry are wrestling with stress, with our research showing that they are the most likely to take work home, stay late in the office and work on days off. Business leaders must provide tangible support that helps staff to form healthy working habits at the start of their careers, if we’re to avoid the risk of fewer young people seeking opportunities in accountancy.”\nWhatever the root cause, it’s clear that stress is having a major impact on accountants. Three-quarters (76%) claim that work has negatively affected them in the past 12 months, with a particular strain being placed on their social lives. Some of the most common effects include:\n- a close relationship being damaged (61%)\n- being unable to partake in hobbies (37%)\n- feeling unable to concentrate on non-work-related issues (28%)\n- being unable to see friends (27%)\n- putting on weight due to a lack of work-life blend (27%)\nColin Ellis is managing editor of Canadian Accountant.

{"question":"What's the deal with carp size - how big can these fish actually get? Curious about max length and weight.","answer":"Carp can grow to impressive sizes. They can reach up to 47 inches in length, though they typically average between 16 to 32 inches. In terms of weight, they can grow up to 80 pounds. They are actually the world's largest minnows, as they belong to the minnow family.","context":["Ebro Dream Fishing I\nRiba-Roja d'Ebre, Ebro (ES)\nCarp (Cyprinus carpio) originally come from Asia, but since ages they are native to Europe. In the Middle Ages, monks introduced carp into ponds and lakes for food. Carp thrive in virtually any environment and can grow up to 80lb!\nQuite surprisingly, carp are a part of the minnow family and are actually the world’s largest minnows. Carp have an overbite “suckerfish” type mouth. They can grow as large as 47 inches long, although they average between 16 to 32 inches. They prefer to hang out in slow-moving or standing water and generally travel in schools of at least five. Carp eat vegetation as well as insects, worms, and crawfish.\nThey are generally a brownish-gold colour with darker tails, dorsal fins and heads. Their large scales form a sort of spotted formation of gold and dark brown. Experts distinguish linear carp, leather carp, common carp, mirror carp, fully scaled mirror carp...\nCarp are native to both Europe and Asia where they are often a target species for many freshwater fishermen. In Europe, Spain, France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Holland are the most passionate about carp fishing.\nSince their introduction into the United States in the 20th century, their population has grown massively in many American bodies of water as well. Carp can be found in every US state except Alaska at this point, but the best carp fishing is in the Great Lakes Basin in the upper Midwest. In fact, each year there is a massive migration of carp into Grand Traverse Bay, part of Lake Michigan.\nFor tackle, we'd need a whole new section. Carp anglers sleep in their bivvy on their stretcher, they have a rodpod for their rods (usually 2 to 4 rods). They have specialized carp fishing landing nets, unhooking mat, weighsling, carp cradle, special desinfectant for hookwoonds in the carp's mouth.\nFor ground baiting, they use a boat with fish finder and sounder or a remote controlled baitboat to drop off the hooklinks and for groundbaiting with pellets, boilies, particles, etc.\nYou’ll want to outfit your rod and reel with medium tackle. Carp can be caught fishign with a float, but most carp anglers fish with a weight on the bottom and a carp rig: simple hair rig, pop-up rig, chod-rig, hinged stiff rig, helicopter rig, KD rig, etc.\nSince carp are bottom feeders, their taste is largely dependent on the body of water that you pulled them out of. Carp have the potential to be very good to eat if caught from a clean source of water which is a surprise to most people.\nWith the above being said most carp fishermen are generally in it for the love of the sport and once a few iconic pictures are taken, carefully return the fish to the water unharmed.\nSince carp can be caught all over the world, in almost every US state and on at least 3 continents, please be sure to check your local regulations before fishing for carp, since they vary everywhere.\nRegulations vary by location, so make sure to stay up to date with the regulations in your area of fishing if you plan on fishing without a charter."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:eeb57c69-059c-41ab-86c7-96e20178905d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Are Brooks Ghost 9 and European straight lacing suitable for people with bunions?","answer":"No, they have different suitability for bunions. The Brooks Ghost 9 is specifically designed to be bunion-friendly with its wide toe box, cushioning, and comfortable mesh upper that allows proper room for the feet. In contrast, European straight lacing, while neat and clean-looking, is primarily designed for formal Oxford shoes and doesn't specifically address bunion concerns. It focuses more on aesthetic appearance and ease of tightening rather than accommodating foot conditions.","context":["Ask anyone what the most overlooked element of a man’s wardrobe is and they probably won’t even think to mention shoelaces. What does that tell you?\nYes, the bits of string that stop your shoes from falling off (unless you’re a 13-year-old skateboarder from 2002) may not be the most exciting part of your outfit, but you wouldn’t get very far without them. Literally. What’s more, if you know the right tricks, you can harness them as another subtle way to add a new style dimension to your look.\nBecause as nerdy as this surely is, how you lace your shoes should depend on which type of shoes you’re actually lacing in the first place. How you tie your smart shoes can be very different to how you lace your Vans.\nLearn the different lacing methods below and find out which one is best for your favourite shoes.\n5 Ways To Lace Your Shoes\nAccording to mathematics that are impossible to understand, renowned shoelace publication New Scientist claims there are a dizzying 400-million possible ways to lace up the average seven-eyelet stomper. Thankfully, we’re not going to be looking at all of them today, but here are a few of the key lacing methods it’s well worth filling your boots with.\nLook down at your trainers. The reason they’re not falling off right now is probably that they’re held in place using this type of lacing.\nThe most common way of fastening shoes, cross-lacing involves threading the lace through the bottom eyelets, leaving an equal length each side, and gradually crisscrossing up to each additional eyelet, one side at a time, until you reach the top.\n- Both lace ends should be inserted downwards through the bottom two eyelets, leaving equal length on both.\n- Take the left lace and place it downwards through the top of the second eyelet on the right. It should now be crossing over the tongue.\n- Do exactly the same to the other lace and insert it downwards through the top of the next eyelet on the left.\n- Continue lacing in this way, one side at a time and remember to put each lace down through the top of each eyelet.\nEuropean Straight Lacing\nIf you’ve ever worn a pair of closed-lace dress shoes, this is most likely how they were fastened. It’s a method well-suited to Oxford shoes and other smart styles as it looks clean and neat from the top.\nThe laces run straight from eyelet to eyelet across the top of the shoe, while a zig-zag pattern underneath allows them to be tightened with ease.\n- Insert both lace ends downwards into each of the bottom holes.\n- Take the left lace and insert it up and through the next free right eyelet.\n- Take the right lace and place it up and through the third eyelet on the left, skipping out the second. There should now be an empty hole on the left hand side.\n- Insert what is now the right lace downward into this free eyelet, which should be directly opposite it.\n- Follow this process until completion, repeating the steps above for each lace.\nGreat for trainers or for adding a dash of personality to dress shoes, over-under lacing pretty much does exactly what it says on the tin.\nStart off the same as you would when making a cross lace, but instead of going up to the next set of eyelets and over the top, go under. After that, go over the top up to the next set of eyelets and keep alternating in this pattern until you get to the top.\n- Insert both lace ends downwards into each of the bottom holes.\n- Put the left lace up and through the next free right hand eyelet.\n- Do the same with the other lace – insert it up and through the first free left hand eyelet.\n- Take what is now the right lace and place it downward through the next available left side eyelet.\n- Do the same with the other lace and repeat this over and under technique until completion.\nStraight Bar Lacing\nIf you like your laces neat, tidy and uncluttered then this may be the lacing method you’ve been looking for.\nThe laces run straight from eyelet to eyelet, horizontally across the top of the shoe. All the excess runs up and under the lace guard on each side, allowing the shoe to be tightened at the top just like normal.\n- Insert both lace ends downwards through the bottom two holes, leaving equal length on both the left and right laces.\n- Looking down on the shoe, insert the left lace up and through the next right hand hole, with its end pointing to the ceiling.\n- Now put the right lace up and through the third eyelet on the left, skipping out the second. There should now be an empty hole on the left hand side.\n- Take what is now the right lace and cross it over, inserting it downward through the empty eyelet on the left. This should create another straight bar, mirroring the first.\n- Do exactly the same with the left hand lace and cross it over, inserting it downward through the empty eyelet opposite it. You should now have three bars.\n- Keep lacing in this way, crossing each lace over to its opposite side to make new bars until you reach the top.\nIf not wearing any underpants is no longer giving you the thrill you crave then why not go even more commando by adopting this military-inspired lacing technique next time you put your boots on?\nGreat for fastening boots swiftly, one end of the lace is permanently anchored at the bottom eyelet, running in a linked ‘S’ shape pattern up the front of the boot and the other end is used for tying off in a slip-knot at the top.\n- Tie a stopper-knot on one end of the lace, before placing the un-knotted end up and through the bottom right eyelet until the knot is taught under the vamp.\n- Take the un-knotted end and run it straight through the opposite bottom eyelet.\n- Now place it up and through the eyelet directly above it before crossing over again down and through the opposite eyelet.\n- Repeat this step across each eyelet until you reach the top. Now tie another stopper-knot to tie it off.\nConsiderations When Re-lacing Shoes\nNothing’s ever simple, is it? And now you can add finding new laces for your shoes to the list. It doesn’t have to be difficult, though. Just follow these pointers and you can’t really put a foot wrong.\nWhen re-lacing your shoes “it really depends on the type of shoe,” says Robbie Evans, men’s own-brand buying manager at Kurt Geiger. “If it’s formal then ideally you’d use a self-colour round lace or you could be braver and contrast a tan leather shoe with a navy or burgundy for example.\n“Sports shoes give you a bit more of a licence to be creative – you can be braver with the different types of sizes and colours to create different looks.”\nLength Of Lace\nA chain is only as strong as its weakest link. That means those shoes you dropped next month’s rent on might be fancy but they’re still going to look naff if they’ve got a set of dangly, rabbit ear-looking laces flopping about every time you take a step.\nTo make sure you get it right, measure your old laces before you buy a new pair to make sure they’re going to be a good fit for the shoe.\nWidth Of Lace\nFat laces might have been cool when you were in year seven with the names of your favourite bands scribbled in biro all over your pencil case. But as a fully grown man? Not so much.\nAs a general rule, don’t go for anything over 1cm and you should be able to avoid looking too ridiculous.\nIt should go without saying, but neon shoelaces aren’t exactly the most style-savvy move you can make as a man. Or woman. Or child. Or beast. Or…you get the idea.\nIn general, aim for laces that either match or complement the colour of your shoes. Brown shoes = brown laces, white shoes with blue accents = white or blue laces. And so on and so forth.\nYou’ve probably never even thought about the composition of your shoelaces before but we are living in the future and as such, you can get laces made from some pretty special stuff.\nFor your winter boots, you might want to consider waxed or even Kevlar laces, while for most other situations, cotton, cord or nylon will do the trick just fine.\nHow To Lace Different Types Of Shoe\nNot all shoes should be laced the same. Allow us to walk you through some of the most popular styles and how to lace each and every one like a pro.\nWhen it comes to casual footwear, Vans is one of the most popular brands around. Made famous by Californian skateboarders in the 1970s, the legendary footwear brand soon stomped its way into the mainstream and became a household name.\nThe most popular models of Vans shoes are the Sk8-Hi, the Era, the Old Skool and the Authentic. The best method for fastening all of these is probably cross-lacing.\nFlat laces should be your first port of call and white will work for most colours. However, it’s very important to buy the right length for your shoe as all of these popular models vary widely in the number of eyelets they have.\nThe Chuck Taylor All Star is probably the most famous sneaker of all time. In fact, it’s nothing short of iconic.\nThe type of laces you pick to tie your converse will be dependant on two factors: whether your shoes are low top or high top, and what colour they are.\nAlways opt for flat laces when it comes to Converse and white should work the best in most cases, unless your shoes are completely black. Then it’s just a case of lacing them up, which is usually done using cross-lacing, but a straight bar lace can look good too.\nYour Oxford dress shoes differ from most of the other shoes in your wardrobe in that they use what’s known as ‘closed lacing’. This means the vamp of the shoe is stitched over the bottom of the lace guards, which gives a slightly less flexible fit but offers a much more formal look.\nWhen it comes to picking laces, you’ll want them to be thin, round and the same colour as your shoes – a black-tie event is no time for risky style experiments.\nTo fasten them, use either a straight bar lace or a European straight lace. Both will work nicely as they leave a clean, uncluttered pattern on the top of the shoe while allowing for easy adjustment.\nBar maybe your slippers, your best sneakers are probably the most comfortable shoes in your collection and the ones that get the most wear. Because of this, it’s important to make sure they’re laced up to perfection.\nWhether you opt for flat or round laces will depend entirely on the type of sneaker and on your own personal preference, but for the likes of most light coloured models, flat, white laces will do the trick.\nAs far as lacing methods go it’s pretty much anything goes, but cross-lacing is definitely the most popular option and always gives a clean, classic look.\nThe Derby is the shoe of choice for office workers and business folk all across the world. This is due in no small part to its unique blend of comfort and smart looks – a mix that no other footwear can match.\nUnlike its dressier cousin, the Oxford, the Derby features an open lacing system which makes them a tad more flexible and more forgiving when worn for extended periods of time. However, it can still be laced in much the same way.\nUse a thin, round lace, the same colour as the shoe and fasten using either the straight bar lacing method or the European straight method. Both will give a neat look while making adjustments nice and easy.\nAside from a pair of white trainers, footwear doesn’t come much more versatile than a pair of desert boots. These adaptable all-rounders are notable for the fact they only tend to have four eyelets in total, which means lacing them up couldn’t be simpler.\nThe main point to take away with you is that the laces shouldn’t be too long as they’re not going to need to stretch very far, so try to pick something pretty short.\nGo for a thin, flat lace in exactly the same colour as the shoe, ensuring its short enough not to leave you with metres of excess. Then use the cross-lacing technique to fix them in place.\nWhether you’re using them to scale the north face of the Matterhorn, or just for nipping out to grab a winter coffee, hiking boots are the trusty old mate who will always have your back. Return the favour and make sure they’re laced up properly to say thanks.\nBoth flat and round laces will work nicely here and there’s even scope to experiment with colour. A yellow, red or even a tasteful two-tone or multicoloured lace can work as long as a bit of thought has been put into it. You’ll also want to make sure the laces are long enough to reach right to the top.\nCross-lacing is the only way to get the job done here, so thread the lace through the lowest set of eyelets and do exactly what you’d do with a pair of trainers. Simple.","Brooks Running Shoes for Bunions\nYour feet are very important to your overall health, which is why you need to select the comfortable shoes possible for them. The proper choice will depend on a variety of factors, such as your planned activity and your foot health. For those with foot conditions, it becomes particularly vital to have the proper footwear so that the condition is not exacerbated by activity. This is why you can find a great selection of Brooks running shoes for bunions.\nThe development of bunions, medically known as hallux valgus, can be caused by heredity and years of wearing tight shoes. Women are more likely to develop them than men, although both genders suffer tremendously with the formation of these painful bumps. It is also possible that your gait especially overpronation and flat feet may be involved with your bunion development. The high heeled pointed toe shoes can also be the cause of bunion formation.\nA bunion occurs at the base of your big toe, at the joint attaching it to the foot. As it moves, the toe begins to point inward, toward the other toes. The base of the toe juts outward. When it first begins to form, you may notice a bony bump on the outside of your foot at the base of the big toe. It may develop a callus as it begins to rub on your shoes.\nAs you walk, pressure lands on this area with each step. Your toe is designed to bend while you are normally walking. However, the misalignment and swelling make this impossible. Instead, the pressure lands directly on it and is not distributed throughout your foot. In the event the misalignment happens on your little toe, the formation is known as a bunionette.\nBefore determining the best Brooks running shoes for bunions that will work for your feet, you need to have them properly analyzed. Visit a specialty running store and ask for a gait analysis. Also, you should visit your primary care physician.\nIf you have over-pronation in your stride, you will need to find Brooks running shoes for bunions that will help you to maintain the proper alignment while you are running. Likewise, if you have flat feet you will need to select the right shoes to provide arch support where you need it. Virtually everyone with bunions can benefit from wearing a wide width shoe. However, some toe boxes are intentionally designed to be wide, providing even greater comfort for the wearer.\nThis is why you need to understand your gait and current foot health. Normally when a person walks, the foot, ankle, leg, knee and hip remain in alignment on each side. This generally straight line keeps the muscles strong and your ligaments and tendons in proper place.\nIf you overpronate, your foot turns when it lands rather than remaining straight. One of the easiest ways to determine if this is a problem for you is to examine the soles of your shoes. Do you see more wear and tear on the inner sides of your shoes? It is possible that you may have even rolled them enough for the shoe to begin turning, wearing out the inner sides as well.\nBrooks Running Shoes for Bunions\nYou can also test your current running shoes by placing them on a flat surface and viewing them straight from the back side. If they tilt inward, you overpronate. You need to look at the following lines of Brooks shoes for a comfortable fit: PureCadence, Ravenna, Adrenaline GTS 16, Transcend, Beast/Ariel or Addiction. The amount of pronation control you need will determine which of these supportive running shoes is best for your feet.\n1. Brooks Mens Ghost 9 for Bunions\nIf you have bunions, it doesn’t mean you quit running altogether. You do have to find a running shoe that fits well. This is not that hard to do with the Ghost 9. It is a very attractive running shoe and the features are all designed with impact, speed, comfort, and breathability in mind.\nThe Ghost 9 has everything a runner could want save for some extra support. This shoe is a neutral running shoe, but it is cushioned, so it does help propel you as you run faster and longer. Your toe off remains consistent throughout your running, too. The segmented “crash pad” on the bottom eases every foot landing.\nThe most important feature of it is its wide toe box. This is perfect for comforting those painful bunions without aggravating them. The inside is comfortable, and the mesh upper allows your feet to get the perfect amount of room or snugness as they need to get during a run. On the downside, if you are running in rainy weather or anywhere that there are puddles the mesh can let in more moisture than you might be happy with.\nIn general, the shoe has a light feel to it which explains why it is perfect for running as fast as you can. The heel to toe arch is steep, but if you have bunions and high arches this shoe is a gift from above. These shoes are ideal for anyone who wants a soft heel for high arches and need to take care of a heel spur. This shoe just right for someone with underpronation.\nThe Ghost 9 has a lot more room in the toe box and a lot more cushioning than the Brooks Launch running shoe. It really is perfect for bunions. The bottom Omega flex grooves also give you traction and flexibility while allowing you to maintain a smoothness to your running.\nEach step feels light, and the cushioned comfort lets you forget about the bunions and focus on your timing. The insoles are removable in the event you need to run with orthotics. This shoe goes for just over $100, so it is priced well for such an incredible shoe. It lets you lift off the ground and land in comfort, and it enables you to go as fast as you want to, and it is bunion-friendly.\n2. Brooks Women’s Adrenaline Gts 17 for Bunions\nThis innovative stability shoe is perfect for men or women with bunions because it provides wide toe box. Available in a variety of colors it offers biomechanical insights. Ideal pressure zones help to disperse the impact and the guide rails offer plenty of on-demand support for all of your foot support needs and requirements.

Your feet will thank you for thinking of their comfort with this shoe.\nThe technology that goes into every pair of Brooks running shoes has earned them a fantastic reputation for making high-quality shoes that provide the best in foot care. For instance, the uppers on the shoes utilize a cutting edge technology that keeps the shoe light and flexible while maintaining the proper shape and support. This screen print engineered structural design is just one of the technological advances made by the company.\nThe midsole of Brooks Running Shoes has a revolutionary cushioning system and a design to help keep your body in proper alignment. Additionally, they are designed to distribute pressure evenly with each step. The heels of the shoes are rounded to reduce stress on your ankle.\nIf you are looking for a pair of shoes for bunions with a lot of cushioning that also provide stability, then try Adrenaline GTS 17.\nOther Measures to Treat Bunions\nShow your doctor your foot or feet. It is likely that she will take x-rays and blood tests. The x-rays will provide a clear picture of the severity of the deformity. If you have liquid or another buildup in the area, it can actually make the misalignment appear worse than it is. Some types of arthritis may show on your blood tests and be the cause of additional pain in the joint.\nIf you have bunions, you may have another, a related condition that needs attention as well. You will need to take into account your entire foot when you are perusing the Brooks running shoes for bunions available online. Those with overpronation or flat foot issues will need to make certain that they have the right arch support as well.\nTo reduce your symptoms, maintain a healthy weight. Running regularly will help you to do that. This is why you need to have a good pair of running shoes that will provide the proper support. Otherwise, you may be in too much pain to exercise at all!\nTake advantage of hot and cold water therapies and get a professional foot massage when you can.

{"question":"Need comprehensive comparison of how Roman and German chamomile varieties perform for treating digestive issues + any research backing their use - thx!","answer":"For digestive issues, both German and Roman chamomile are traditionally used to treat similar conditions including nausea, vomiting, heartburn, excess gas, ulcers, and general gastrointestinal irritation. However, the scientific evidence supporting these uses differs between the two varieties. For German chamomile, while it is widely used for numerous gastrointestinal conditions, there is currently a lack of reliable human research confirming its effectiveness for any digestive condition. For Roman chamomile, its use for digestive issues is based almost entirely on traditional use and clinical experience, with even less scientific research than German chamomile. Neither variety has strong scientific evidence supporting their effectiveness for digestive conditions, despite their long history of traditional use.","context":["Anthemis arvensis, Anthemis cotula, Anthemis nobile, Anthemis nobilis, Anthemis xylopoda, apigenin, Asteraceae/Compositae (family), baboonig, babuna, babunah, babunah camomile, babunj, bunga kamil, camamila, camamilla, camomile, camomile sauvage, camomilla, Camomille Allemande, Campomilla, chamaemeloside, Chamaemelum nobile L., chamomile flowers, Chamomilla, Chamomilla recutita, chamomillae ramane flos, chamomille commune, classic chamomile, common chamomile, double chamomile, Echte Kamille (Dutch), English chamomile, feldkamille (German), fleur de chamomile (French), fleurs de petite camomille (French), Flores Anthemidis, flos chamomillae, garden chamomile, German chamomile, Grosse Kamille, Grote Kamille, ground apple, Hungarian chamomile, Kamille, Kamillen, kamitsure, kamiture, Kleine, kleme kamille, lawn chamomile, low chamomile, manzanilla, manzanilla chiquita, manzilla comun, manzanilla dulce, matricaire, Matricaria chamomilla, Matricaria maritime (L.), Matricaria recutita, Matricaria suaveolens, matricariae flos, matricariae flowers, may-then, Nervine, pin heads, rauschert, Romaine, romaine manzanilla, Roman chamomile, Romische Kamille, single chamomile, STW 5 (containing Iberis, peppermint, chamomile), sweet chamomile, sweet false chamomile, sweet feverfew, true chamomile, whig-plant, wild chamomile.\nChamomile has been used medicinally for thousands of years and is widely used in Europe. It is a popular treatment for numerous ailments, including sleep disorders, anxiety, digestion/intestinal conditions, skin infections/inflammation (including eczema), wound healing, infantile colic, teething pains, and diaper rash. In the United States, chamomile is best known as an ingredient in herbal tea preparations advertised for mild sedating effects.\nGerman chamomile (Matricaria recutita) and Roman chamomile (Chamaemelum nobile) are the two major types of chamomile used for health conditions. They are believed to have similar effects on the body, although German chamomile may be slightly stronger. Most research has used German chamomile, which is more commonly used everywhere except for England, where Roman chamomile is more common.\nAlthough chamomile is widely used, there is not enough reliable research in humans to support its use for any condition. Despite its reputation as a gentle medicinal plant, there are many reports of allergic reactions in people after eating or coming into contact with chamomile preparations, including life-threatening anaphylaxis.\nThese uses have been tested in humans or animals. Safety and effectiveness have not always been proven. Some of these conditions are potentially serious, and should be evaluated by a qualified healthcare provider.\nChamomile is not well-known for its cardiac effects, and there is little research in this area. Large, well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed before a firm conclusion can be made.\nIn early study, inhaling steam with chamomile extract has been reported to help common cold symptoms. Further research is needed to confirm these results.\nDiarrhea in children\nPreliminary study reports that chamomile with apple pectin may reduce the length of time that children experience diarrhea. Further research is needed before a strong recommendation can be made.\nThe German Commission E authorizes the use of topical chamomile for diseases of the skin. However, little research has been done on topical chamomile for eczema and further research is needed.\nChamomile is used traditionally for numerous gastrointestinal conditions, including digestion disorders, \"spasm\" or colic, upset stomach, flatulence (gas), ulcers, and gastrointestinal irritation. However, currently there is a lack of reliable human research available in any of these areas. Additional study is needed.\nHemorrhagic cystitis (bladder irritation with bleeding)\nPreliminary study reports that the combination of chamomile baths plus chamomile bladder washes and antibiotics is superior to antibiotics alone for hemorrhagic cystitis. Additional research is necessary before a conclusion can be reached.\nPreliminary study reports that chamomile ointment may improve hemorrhoids. Better evidence is needed before a strong recommendation can be made.\nChamomile is reputed to have anti-spasmodic activity, but there is little research to substantiate this claim. Additional research evaluating chamomile alone is needed.\nMucositis from cancer treatment (mouth ulcers/irritation)\nPoor-quality studies have used chamomile mouthwash for the prevention or treatment of mouth mucositis caused by radiation therapy or cancer chemotherapy. Results are conflicting, and it remains unclear if chamomile is helpful in this situation.\nQuality of life in cancer patients\nA small amount of research suggests that massage using chamomile essential oil may improve anxiety and quality of life in cancer patients. However, this evidence is not high quality. Additional study is needed before a firm conclusion can be reached.\nTopical chamomile preparations have traditionally been used to soothe skin inflammation. The existing human evidence shows that chamomile may be of little, if any, benefit while animal studies support its anti-inflammatory action. Additional human research is needed in this area.\nSleep aid / sedation\nTraditionally, chamomile preparations, such as tea and essential oil aromatherapy, have been used for insomnia and sedation (calming effects). Better research is needed before a recommendation can be made.\nVaginitis (inflammation of the vagina)\nVaginitis may involve itching, discharge, or pain with urination. Chamomile douche may improve symptoms of vaginitis with few side effects. Because infection (including sexually transmitted diseases), poor hygiene, or nutritional deficiencies can cause vaginitis, medical attention should be sought by people with this condition. Better research is needed before a conclusion can be drawn regarding the role of chamomile in the management of vaginitis.\nThere is promising preliminary evidence supporting the topical use of chamomile for wound healing. However, the available literature is not adequate to support a recommendation either for or against this use.\nPost-operative sore throat/hoarseness due to intubation\nChamomile spray has not been found to prevent post-operative sore throat and hoarseness any more than normal saline.\n*Key to grades:\nA: Strong scientific evidence for this use;\nB: Good scientific evidence for this use;\nC: Unclear scientific evidence for this use;\nD: Fair scientific evidence against this use (it may not work);\nF: Strong scientific evidence against this use (it likely does not work).\nThe below uses are based on tradition, scientific theories, or limited research. They often have not been thoroughly tested in humans, and safety and effectiveness have not always been proven. Some of these conditions are potentially serious, and should be evaluated by a qualified healthcare provider. There may be other proposed uses that are not listed below.

Many herbs and supplements have not been thoroughly tested, and safety and effectiveness may not be proven. Brands may be made differently, with variable ingredients, even within the same brand. The below doses may not apply to all products. You should read product labels, and discuss doses with a qualified healthcare provider before starting therapy.\nAdults (18 years and older)\nCapsules/tablets containing 400 to 1,600 milligrams in divided doses have been taken by mouth daily. As a liquid extract (1:1 in 45% alcohol), 1 to 4 milliliters three times daily has been taken by mouth. As a tincture (1:5 in alcohol), 15 milliliters three to four times per day has been used. As a mouth rinse, a 1% fluid extract or 5% tincture has been used.\nChamomile is frequently consumed as tea, and 1 to 4 cups of chamomile tea taken daily (from tea bags) is a common dose.\nThere are no standard doses for chamomile used on the skin. Some natural medicine publications have recommended paste, plaster, or ointment containing 3% to 10% chamomile flower heads. Chamomile has been also used as a bath additive and as a douche.\nChildren (younger that 18 years)\nThere is not enough reliable scientific data available to recommend the safe use of chamomile products in children.\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration does not strictly regulate herbs and supplements. There is no guarantee of strength, purity or safety of products, and effects may vary. You should always read product labels. If you have a medical condition, or are taking other drugs, herbs, or supplements, you should speak with a qualified healthcare provider before starting a new therapy. Consult a healthcare provider immediately if you experience side effects.\nThere are multiple reports of serious allergic reactions to chamomile taken by mouth or as an enema, including anaphylaxis, throat swelling, and shortness of breath. Skin allergic reactions have been frequently reported, including dermatitis and eczema. Chamomile eyewash can cause allergic conjunctivitis (pinkeye).\nPeople with allergies to other plants in the Asteraceae (Compositae) family should avoid chamomile. Examples include: aster, chrysanthemum, mugwort, ragweed, and ragwort. Cross-reactions may occur with celery, chrysanthemum, feverfew, tansy, and birch pollen. Individuals with allergies to these plants should avoid chamomile. Contact skin allergy has been reported.\nImpurities (adulterants) in chamomile products are common and may cause adverse effects. Atopic dermatitis (skin rash) has been reported.\nChamomile in various forms may cause drowsiness or sedation. Use caution when driving or operating heavy machinery. In large doses, chamomile can cause vomiting. Due to its coumarin content, chamomile may theoretically increase the risk of bleeding. Caution is advised in patients with bleeding disorders or taking drugs that may increase the risk of bleeding. Dosing adjustments may be necessary. Increases in blood pressure are possible.\nPregnancy and Breastfeeding\nIn theory, chamomile may act as a uterine stimulant or lead to abortion. It therefore should be avoided during pregnancy. There is not enough scientific data to recommend the safe use of chamomile while breastfeeding.\nMost herbs and supplements have not been thoroughly tested for interactions with other herbs, supplements, drugs, or foods. The interactions listed below are based on reports in scientific publications, laboratory experiments, or traditional use. You should always read product labels. If you have a medical condition, or are taking other drugs, herbs, or supplements, you should speak with a qualified healthcare provider before starting a new therapy.\nInteractions with Drugs\nChamomile interactions are not well studied scientifically.\nChamomile may increase the amount of drowsiness caused by some drugs. Examples include benzodiazepines such as lorazepam (Ativan©) or diazepam (Valium©), barbiturates such as phenobarbital, narcotics such as codeine, some antidepressants, and alcohol. Caution is advised while driving or operating machinery.\nIn theory, chamomile may increase the risk of bleeding when used with anticoagulants or antiplatelet drugs. Some examples include aspirin, anticoagulants (\"blood thinners\") such as warfarin (Coumadin©) or heparin, anti-platelet drugs such as clopidogrel (Plavix©), and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (Motrin©, Advil©) or naproxen (Naprosyn©, Aleve©).\nChamomile may interfere with the way the body processes certain drugs using the liver's \"cytochrome P450\" enzyme system. As a result, the levels of these drugs may be increased in the blood and may cause increased effects or potentially serious adverse reactions. Patients using any medications should check the package insert and speak with a healthcare professional including a pharmacist about possible interactions.\nBe aware that many tinctures contain high levels of alcohol and may cause vomiting when taken with metronidazole (Flagyl©) or disulfiram (Antabuse©).\nAn extract containing Matricaria chamomile, Sideritis euboea, Sideritis clandestine, and Pimpinella anisum was associated with selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) properties against osteoporosis. Theoretically, chamomile may interact with SERM drugs like raloxifene (prescription drug used for osteoporosis) or tamoxifen (a prescription drug used for cancer).\nConstituents in chamomile may alter blood sugar or blood pressure. Patients taking medications that affect blood sugar or blood pressure should be cautious.\nChamomile may have anti-inflammatory effects. Theoretically, use of chamomile with other anti-inflammatory drugs, such as NSAIDs or ibuprofen, may have additive effects.\nChamomile may interact with medications that act as cardiac depressants, central nervous system depressants, calcium channel blockers, cardiac glycosides, and respiratory depressants.\nChamomile may also interact with antibiotics, antifungals, antihistamines, diuretics, as well as drugs for high cholesterol, ulcers, diarrhea, or gastrointestinal disorders.\nInteractions with Herbs and Dietary Supplements\nChamomile may increase the amount of drowsiness caused by some herbs or supplements. Caution is advised while driving or operating machinery.\nIn theory, chamomile may increase the risk of bleeding when taken with other products that are believed to increase the risk of bleeding. Multiple cases of bleeding have been reported with the use of Ginkgo biloba, and fewer cases with garlic and saw palmetto. Numerous other agents may theoretically increase the risk of bleeding, although this has not been proven in most cases.\nChamomile may interfere with the way the body processes certain drugs using the liver's \"cytochrome P450\" enzyme system. As a result, the levels of other herbs or supplements may become too high in the blood. It may also alter the effects that other herbs or supplements possibly have on the P450 system. Patients using any medications should check the package insert and speak with a healthcare professional including a pharmacist about possible interactions.\nChamomile may have anti-estrogenic effects and interact with herbs and supplements like red clover or soy.\nBased on preliminary study, constituents in chamomile may alter blood sugar or blood pressure. Patients taking herbs or supplements that affect blood sugar or blood pressure should be cautious.\nChamomile may have anti-inflammatory effects. Theoretically, the use of chamomile with other anti-inflammatory herbs and supplements may have additive effects.\nChamomile may interact with herbs and supplements that act as cardiac depressants, cardiac glycosides, respiratory depressants, or spasmolytics.\nChamomile may also interact with antibacterial, antifungal, antihistamine, or diuretic herbs and supplements, as well as herbs and supplements used for high cholesterol, ulcers, diarrhea, or gastrointestinal disorders.\nThis information is based on a systematic review of scientific literature edited and peer-reviewed by contributors to the Natural Standard Research Collaboration (www.naturalstandard.com).\nNatural Standard Bottom Line Monograph, Copyright © 2011 (www.naturalstandard.com).

Learn about the usage, dosage, side-effects of Roman Chamomile.\nBotanical Name:Chamaemelum nobile\nCommon Names: Roman Chamomile\n- Plant Description\n- What's It Made Of?\n- Available Forms\n- How to Take It\n- Possible Interactions\n- Supporting Research\nThere are two plants known as chamomile: the more popular German chamomile (Matricaria recutita) and Roman, or English, chamomile (Chamaemelum nobile). Both belong to the Asteraceae family, which also includes ragweed, echinacea, and feverfew. Both have been used traditionally to calm frayed nerves, to treat various digestive disorders, to relieve muscle spasms and menstrual cramps, and to treat a range of skin conditions (including minor first degree burns) and mild infections. Chamomile can also be found in a variety of face creams, drinks, hair dyes, shampoos, and perfumes.\nMost research on chamomile has been done with the closely related plant, German chamomile, which has similar, but not identical, active ingredients. Roman chamomile has not been used in studies of people as much as German chamomile, so claims about its use for specific health conditions are based on clinical experience and will have to be verified through future research. Nevertheless, Roman chamomile is an ingredient in many teas, ointments, and other types of medicinal preparations.\nTraditionally, Roman chamomile has been used to treat nausea, vomiting, heartburn, and excess intestinal gas that can happen when feeling nervous. It is widely valued for its tension-relieving properties. As legend has it, Peter Rabbit's mother used Roman chamomile tea to calm him down after his adventures in Mr. MacGregor's garden. This herb may also reduce inflammation associated with cuts or hemorrhoids, and may ease the discomfort associated with conditions such as eczema and gingivitis (swollen gums). The traditional uses of Roman chamomile, again while not studied scientifically are quite similar to the uses for German chamomile.\nRoman chamomile originates in northwestern Europe and Northern Ireland, where it creeps close to the ground and can reach up to one foot in height. Gray-green leaves grow from the stems, and the flowers have yellow centers surrounded by white petals, like miniature daisies. It differs from German chamomile in that its leaves are thicker and it grows closer to the ground. The flowers smell like apples.\nChamomile teas, ointments, and extracts all start with the white and yellow flower head. The flower heads may be dried and used in teas or capsules or crushed and steamed to produce a blue oil, which has medicinal benefits. The oil contains ingredients that reduce swelling and may limit the growth of bacteria, viruses, and fungi.\nRoman chamomile is available as dried flowers in bulk, tea, tinctures, and in creams and ointments.\nThere are no known scientific reports regarding the appropriate pediatric dose of Roman chamomile. For this reason, children should not take this herb.\nRoman chamomile can be taken a number of ways. A cup of hot chamomile tea may help soothe an upset stomach or help those who suffer from insomnia. The oral dosages listed below should help relieve stomach discomfort; chamomile has also been used for reducing menstrual pain and the swelling of gums in the case of gingivitis. The ointment and bath recommendations are for skin conditions.\n- Tea: Pour one cup of boiling water over 1 heaping tablespoon of dried herb, steep 10 to 15 minutes.\n- Liquid extract (1:1, 70% alcohol) 20 to 120 drops, three times per day\n- Bath: Add two teabags or a few drops of Roman chamomile essential oil to a full tub of bathwater to soothe hemorrhoids or skin problems\n- Cream/Ointment: Apply cream or ointment containing 3% to 10% chamomile content\nThe use of herbs is a time-honored approach to strengthening the body and treating disease. Herbs, however, contain active substances that can trigger side effects and interact with other herbs, supplements, or medications. For these reasons, herbs should be taken with care, under the supervision of a practitioner knowledgeable in the field of botanical medicine.\nChamomile is considered generally safe by the FDA. Roman chamomile contains an ingredient, anthemic acid, which can induce vomiting if taken in high doses. Highly concentrated tea may therefore cause vomiting.\nThose who are allergic to ragweed or other plants in the Asteraceae family (including echinacea, feverfew, and chrysanthemums) should avoid chamomile. Allergic reactions are somewhat common, actually, and may include stomach cramps, tongue thickness, swollen lips and eyes (called angioedema), itching, hives, throat tightness, and even shortness of breath. The latter two symptoms are medical emergencies and medical care should be sought urgently.\nIf you are currently being treated with any of the following medications, you should not use Roman chamomile without first talking to your healthcare provider.\nBecause of its calming effects, chamomile should not be taken in conjunction with sedative medications (particularly those that belong to a class called benzodiazepines such as alprazolam and lorazepam) or alcohol.\nPatients taking blood-thinning medications such as warfarin should use Roman chamomile only under the careful supervision of a healthcare practitioner. Although not proven scientifically, this herb may, in theory, enhance the effects of the medication.\nback to: Herbal Treatments Homepage\nBlumenthal M, ed.

He attended Central High School in Cleveland, Ohio, where he began writing poetry in the eighth grade. His father would discourage him from pursuing writing as a career, in favour of something 'more practical'. Langston's tuition fees to Columbia University were paid on the grounds that he study engineering.\nAfter a while, he dropped out of the degree course, but continued to write poetry. His first published poem, The Negro Speaks of Rivers, was also one of his most famous, appearing in Brownie's Book. Later, his poems, short plays, essays and short stories would appear in the NAACP publication, Crisis Magazine, in Opportunity Magazine, and others.\nOne of Hughes' most acclaimed essays appeared in the Nation in 1926, entitled \"The Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain\". It spoke of Black writers and poets, \"who would surrender racial pride in the name of a false integration,\" where a talented Black writer would prefer to be considered a poet, not a Black poet, which to Hughes meant he subconsciously wanted to write like a white poet. Hughes argued, \"no great poet has ever been afraid of being himself.\"\n\"We younger Negro artists now intend to express our individual dark-\nskinned selves without fear or shame. If white people are pleased we are\nglad. If they aren't, it doesn't matter. We know we are beautiful. And\nugly too... If colored people are pleased we are glad. If they are not,\ntheir displeasure doesn't matter either. We build our temples for\ntomorrow, as strong as we know how and we stand on the top of the\nmountain, free within ourselves.\"\nHughes' travels ranged to such diverse locations as Senegal, Nigeria, the Cameroons, the Belgian Congo, Angola, and Guinea in Africa; to Italy, France, Russia and Spain. Whether abroad, or at home in the US, Hughes loved to sit in the clubs listening to blues, jazz and writing poetry. A 'new rhythm' emerged in his writing, as evidenced by his collection of poems, \"The Weary Blues\". Returning to live in Harlem in 1924 -during a period often referred to as the 'Harlem Renaissance'- his work was frequently published and he wrote prolifically. Moving to Washington D.C., in 1925, his time spent in blues and jazz clubs increased even further.\n\"I tried to write poems like the songs they sang on Seventh Street...\n(these songs) had the pulse beat of the people who keep on going.\"\nAt this same time, Hughes accepted a job with Dr. Carter G. Woodson, editor of the Journal of Negro Life and History and founder of Black History Week in 1926. He returned to his beloved Harlem later that year.\nLangston Hughes received a scholarship to Lincoln University, in Pennsylvania, where he received his B.A. degree in 1929. In 1943, he was awarded an honorary Lit.D by his alma mater; a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1935 and a Rosenwald Fellowship in 1940. Based on a conversation with a man he knew in a Harlem bar, he created a character know as My Simple Minded Friend in a series of essays in the form of a dialogue. In 1950, he named this lovable character Jess B. Simple, and authored a series of books on him.\nLangston Hughes was a prolific writer. In the forty-odd years between his first book in 1926 and his death in 1967, he devoted his life to writing and lecturing. He wrote sixteen books of poems, two novels, three collections of short stories, four volumes of \"editorial\" and \"documentary\" fiction, twenty plays, children's poetry, musicals and operas, three autobiographies, a dozen radio and television scripts and dozens of magazine articles. In addition, he edited seven anthologies. The long and distinguished list of Hughes' works includes: Not Without Laughter (1930); The Big Sea (1940); I Wonder As I Wander\" (1956), his autobiographies. His collections of poetry include: The Weary Blues (1926); The Negro Mother and other Dramatic Recitations (1931); The Dream Keeper (1932); Shakespeare In Harlem (1942); Fields of Wonder (1947); One Way Ticket (1947); The First Book of Jazz (1955); Tambourines To Glory (1958); and Selected Poems (1959); The Best of Simple (1961). He edited several anthologies in an attempt to popularize black authors and their works. Some of these are: An African Treasury (1960); Poems from Black Africa (1963); New Negro Poets: USA (1964) and The Best Short Stories by Negro Writers (1967).\nPublished posthumously were: Five Plays By Langston Hughes (1968); The Panther and The Lash: Poems of Our Times (1969) and Good Morning Revolution: Uncollected Writings of Social Protest (1973); The Sweet Flypaper of Life with Roy DeCarava (1984).\nLangston Hughes died of cancer on May 22, 1967. His residence at 20 East 127th Street in Harlem, New York has been given landmark status by the New York City Preservation Commission. His block of East 127th Street was renamed \"Langston Hughes Place\" . ..\nAdvertisement For The Waldorf-Astoria\nFine living . . . a la carte?\nCome to the Waldorf-Astoria!\nLISTEN HUNGRY ONES!\nLook!

{"question":"Can you compare the total number of human genes to the number of protein molecules in the human body?","answer":"The human genome contains approximately 20,000 genes in total, which is significantly less than the number of protein molecules that build and run the human body, which is less than 100,000. Each protein molecule has a corresponding gene that provides instructions for its production. This relationship between genes and proteins is regulated by short DNA segments next to each gene, which control when and where genes are activated.","context":["Since the sequencing of the human genome in 2001, all our genes – around 20,000 in total – have been identified. But much is still unknown – for instance where and when each is active. Next to each gene sits a short DNA segment, and the activity of this regulatory segment determines whether the gene will be turned on, where and how strongly. These short regulatory segments are as – if not more – important than the genes, themselves. Indeed, 90% of the mutations that cause disease occur in these regulatory areas. They are responsible for the proper development of tissues and organs, determining, for instance, that eye cells – and only eye cells – contain light receptors, while only pancreatic cells function to produce insulin. Clearly, a deeper understanding of this regulatory system – its mechanisms and possibilities for malfunction – may lead to advances in biomedical research, especially in developing targeted therapies for individual patients.\nIn spite of their importance, the \"regulatory code\" is not well understood. To address this problem, a research team led by Dr. Ido Amit of the Weizmann Institute Immunology Department, together with scientists from the Broad Institute in Massachusetts, including Manuel Garber, Nir Yosef and Aviv Regev, and Nir Friedman of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, developed an advanced, automated system for mapping these sites, and then used this system to uncover important principles how these regulatory elements function. Among other things, their study, which appeared in Molecular Cell, revealed a hierarchical structure for the regulatory code. By mapping a large number of regulatory factors, the team succeeded in revealing an overall plan for gene regulation as well as the intimate details of the mechanisms involved in the immune response.\n\"We are seeing a race to map the regulatory code and uncover its ties to disease and human variation that is reminiscent of the race to sequence the human genome,\" says Amit. \"But until now, participants have faced a serious hurdle: The process used for the past 30 years to map regulatory elements has been complicated, complex and labor-intensive, requiring huge scientific consortiums. With the new method, just a handful of researchers were able to conduct a study on a similar scale to the mega-team ones, and in a fraction of the time.\"\nTheir highly efficient, automated method enabled Amit and his team to measure a large number of regulatory proteins and their binding sites in parallel. They exposed immune cells to bacteria – setting the stage for gene activation – and then traced the actions of several dozen different regulatory proteins known to play a role in the immune response over four points in time. Not only were the researchers able to identify the binding locations of each and the genes they activate, but the levels of activation and the mechanisms employed.\nOne of their more significant findings was that the actions of these regulatory factors can be neatly classified into three levels in a sort of regulatory hierarchy. In the bottom tier are those factors that create the rough divisions into main cell types by directing cell differentiation. These factors are the \"basic identity\" guides that can, on their own, determine whether a cell will have the characteristics of a muscle cell, a nerve cell, etc. On the second tier are the regulatory factors that determine a cell's sub-identity, which they do by controlling the strength of a gene's expression. These factors are in charge of producing closely-related sub-types, for instance, muscle fibers that are either smooth or striated, or closely-related immune cells. Regulatory factors in the third tier are even more specialized: They only affect the expression of certain genes that are called into action in response to signals from outside the cell: bacterial invaders, hormones, hunger pangs, etc.\nThe hope is that understanding the ins and outs of the regulatory code will help researchers to understand and predict how diseases arise and progress due to malfunctions in regulatory mechanisms. In the future, understanding the regulatory program may lead to advances in rehabilitative medicine. Regulatory mechanisms could be used to redirect the differentiation of a patient's cells, which could then be reimplanted, thus avoiding the problems inherent in using donor cells.\nAmit: \"The new method for mapping the gene's regulatory plan may open new vistas for investigating all sorts of biological processes, including the system failures that occur in disease.\"\nMore information: www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1097276512006570","Despite all the things that human being can do or are capable of doing, their bodies are built on and run by less than 100,000 protein molecules. Each of these protein molecules has a corresponding gene, which is responsible for ensuring that there is a timely flow of instructions. The human being, therefore, functions by a set of genetic instructions.\nThe Human genome is a complement of genetic material that is found in the human cell. Though there are over a billion people in the world today, there are only minute differences between genomes, which is why it is usually referred to as the human genome, as if there is only one in the whole world. The singular reference to the human genome is only intended to stipulate how little difference there is the genomes found in different human cells.\nYou might then wonder that if the human genome is all the same, how come each of us is so different. The human genome is distributed about twenty three different sets of chromosomes, which have been replicated in each of us since the fusion of egg and sperm at conception. It is this, which causes our individual uniqueness. Scientists have always said that our individual uniqueness is as a result of the seven trillion cells that are preserved in each of our bodies.\nEssential to note is that the human genome is a DNA or deoxyribonucleic acid. It is a natural polymer, which is built u of repeating nucleotides. Each of these nucleotides consists of a simple sugar, one of four nitrogenous bases and a phosphate group. If all the chromosomes are counted, it can be found that the human genome is comprised of about three billion base pairs of chromosomes. Also, vital to note is the fact that though the human genome has been read by DNA sequencing, it is still not well understood.\nSimply put, the human genome is a set of human genetic information that is stored as DNA sequences. We have what is called the haploid human genome and the diploid human genome. The haploid human genome can be found in the egg and sperm cells. Research shows that this genome has about three billion DNA base pairs. On the other hand, the diploid genome is found in the somatic cells and has twice the DNA content as the haploid human genome. As has been stated, the human genome is still not well understood. It is for this reason that the Human Genome Project was created.\nThis project is said to have been the first one to produce a complete sequence of separate human genomes. By 2012, the project had finished sequencing thousands of individual human genomes and had mapped out many more for lower level resolution. Research indicates that a more understanding of the human genome will lead to better diagnosis and treatment of diseases. It will also lead to more insight into human evolution and human biology. The advantages of a better understanding of the human genome are, therefore, endless."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5dfb448a-dda1-44ab-a85a-a957b57f5462>","<urn:uuid:7512facd-1b38-4242-96f7-e8eb371bfe98>"],"error":null}

It lies 5km north of the modern town of Siem Reap, Northwest plains of Cambodia.\nThe temple was dedicated to Lord Vishnu early in the 12th century and then converted to a Buddhist temple. It has been built on the order/request of King Surya Varman.\nSite, Layout, and Aesthetics\nSpatial structure, rich cultural heritage connected with the nature’s-built environment, surrounded by moats and forests is a retreat to Architecture.\nIts massive stone structure with intricate architectural features leaves the visitors with astonishment and everlasting memory. The classical style of Khmer architecture, temple’s remarkable layering of five towers and three rectangular galleries are the characteristic of the Angkor Wat temple. With west orientation, the temple occupies a rectangular about 1500 by 1300mts covering 162.6 hectares. As a three-tiered pyramid, it comprises three levels, the first and second levels with galleries, columns, courtyards, and the third level with five towers arranged in quincunx form-one in the center and the other four in four corners each. The towers, shaped like lotus petals with their central spire rising to 65m from the ground, represent Mount Meru. The three rectangular galleries, chambers with sloped roofs, are arranged one above the other. On the terrace, giant stone lions take their place as if they are safeguarding the temple. A vast compound wall (3.6km long) surrounds the temple, and the surrounding terrace graced with sugar palms and mango trees.\nMoats surround the external enclosure of the monument that is over five km long, bordered by sandstone steps. The view of the temple reflecting its majestic facade in the moats is a delightful experience.\nThe Principal Entrance of Angkor Wat – Western Causeway\nAccording to Dr. Bosch, this westward orientation is typical of Indo-Javanese funerary monuments. The long causeway, shaded by a magnificent banyan tree, leads to the west entrance and draws our eyes to the glorious facade. The causeway, paved and faced in sandstone bordered by Naga (five-headed snake), which in presence of sunlight, fringe it with the play of light and shadow.\nSymbolism and Significance\nIn 1866, the Scottish photographer John Thomson mentioned the temple represents the whole of the Universe, Mount Meru- the center of the Universe, the central quincunx depicts five peaks of the mountain, the three terraces of the temple as the three elements of earth, water, and wind on which the heavenly mountain rests. Moat symbolizing mountain ranges and the ocean, the central shrine aligns to the rising sun.\nThe construction of Angkor Wat also represents a spiritual significance as the home of gods.\nScale and Proportion\nPerfectly ordered and balanced plan, symmetry and harmony of proportions, and purity of lines; all define Angkors’ work power. Exquisite carvings of reliefs and carvings make it one of the admired monuments of the world. Even though the facades are enormous, entrances to the interior are simple, with rectangular openings proportionate to human scale. Researcher Eleanor Mannikka states that the arrangement of solar and lunar eclipses meant to honor and raise the King’s power.\nMaterials, Textures, Techniques, and Details\nThe walls of the open and lengthy corridors of the galleries with richly ornate false doors are filled with written inscriptions, carved reliefs, and paintings. Their linear arrangement express movement across the space. The galleries are welcoming by colonnaded facades. The walls of the open and lengthy corridors of the galleries embellish with richly ornate false doors, written inscriptions, carved reliefs, and paintings. Their linear arrangement express movement across space. The ceilings of the primary vaults (of the crossing cloister) paneled with timber sculpted with rosettes as lotus blossoms, provide extraordinary views.\nWe can see the exceptional skills of the sculptor in the works of bas reliefs, mural ornamentation, colonnettes, lintels, pilasters, false doors, and other architectural features.\nThe inscriptions describe the history of Cambodia and take the visitor’s back to the 7th century, written in two languages-one in Sanskrit written in verses, the other is Khmer or Cambodian-the local language. They engraved stones with a chisel less than one centimeter on the walls, door openings of the sanctuaries covering most of the stone surface.\nThe walls, lintels, columns of the monument adorn the sandstone carvings of various deities, which enhance the magnificence and gloriousness of the temple. The reliefs are so intricate and precisely finished; that it is difficult to match with the works of modern construction machinery standards.\nThe reliefs include stories from Ramayana and Mahabharata, the great Hindu epics seen in the galleries comprising columns on the outer side and walls on the inner side carved with beautiful reliefs on four sides of the temple.\nOn the bas reliefs, one can see the picture of customs, traditions, followed in daily life in the ancient times in that region; the carts, costumes, instruments used for cultivation, hunting, fishing, trade, arts and crafts, the parades celebrating on significant days, etc.\nThe central Quincunx is surrounding by galleries on four sides. The two galleries of north and south of 2.9m in width are closed to the exterior and have a double row of pillars towards the courtyards.\nThe western gallery with the scenes such as the Battle of Lanka and the Battle of Kurukshetra (between Kauravas and Pandavas) with Lord Krishna and Arjuna on their chariots holding weapons and the soldiers with their horses surrounding them; depicts fine craftsmanship.\nThe southern gallery highlights the story of the procession of King Surya Varman II and his entire kingdom. The palanquin used by a queen, the written inscriptions, the commandos with the levels of royalty, marching with weapons uniformly and steadily, the elephants and horses each of them define remarkable craft. Afterlife judgment of Yama Raj depicting the punishments shown, where the souls with good deeds carried to heaven and bad ones drawn to hell., each of them with distinct gestures and expressions represents unique stone carvings.\nThe eastern gallery stone carvings depict the story of the churning of the sea under Lord Vishnu’s direction in the center. Beautiful carvings of the serpent (Vasuki) spreading around the mountain, Devas, and Asuras on either side holding the snake, the sea animals being affected by the churning of a mountaintop, are framed into incredible scenery.\nThe northern gallery shows the battle between Lord Krishna and Bana.\nThe Apsaras exhibit distinct hairstyles, attire, and ornaments; dancing effortlessly, showing a splendid rhythm reflects the culture during the Angkor period.\nSimple square /rectangular Windows with turned balustrades adorn the walls of the galleries, providing ample ventilation distinguished from the usual style of design.\nPreservation/ Sustainability of Angkor Wat\nEven though Angkor Wat lasted thousands of years, it has faced damage and deterioration by ancient wars, theft, plant growth and fungi. The few portions of three towers are unfortunately crumbled, weatherworn sandstone statues, passageways with plain walls rather than monuments. Corners are decayed in few places by water infiltration through the loose-jointed vaults.\nThe Archeological Survey of India has taken the responsibility of maintaining and preserving the natural state of monuments and protecting the cultural heritage.\nThe temple was constructed with sandstone as the primary building material, and laterite used in most segments. One of the most striking aspects is that few parts were built with no application of the binding agent. Five to ten million sandstone blocks were used with a maximum weight of 1.5 tons each. Holes on some walls indicate they were decorated with bronze sheets. Reliefs are carved kilometers together with the gallery wall alone comprising 1000sq.m\nTourism and Angkor Wat\nImpressive in the character of its grand Architectural composition, Ankor Wat has now become one of the famous tourist attractions. It is increasingly becoming a source of revenue and also promotes international tourism, which helps in understanding different people, languages, history, lifestyle, and cultures.\nA great example of architectural marvel with features like gopuras representing style and period, galleries and towers with historical stories carved, courtyards forming central performing art places, ceilings decorated with lotus rosettes symbolizing nation, walls with oil paintings and dancing figures representing art forms and evidence in the past, all these depict cultural, religious and symbolic values representing a nation, as well as architectural, archeological and artistic significance.\nSahithi is a South Indian-based Architect and Interior designer.

{"question":"Are natural flood defenses in England and volcanic activity in the Pacific Ring of Fire both affected by human intervention?","answer":"Yes, but in different ways. England's floodplains have been severely impacted by human activities, with 90% no longer functioning properly due to intensive agriculture and urbanization. In contrast, the volcanic activity in the Pacific Ring of Fire has been studied through human intervention in the form of scientific drilling, which has helped understand how subduction zones develop and influence global elemental cycles.","context":["Only a tenth of England’s extensive floodplains are now fit for purpose – 90% no longer function properly – with the shortfall putting an increasing number of homes and businesses at risk of flooding, according to a new report.\nFloods are more likely due to climate change and will claim higher economic costs unless action is taken to halt the damage to floodplains and restore some of their functions, warned the authors of the 12-month study – the first to paint a comprehensive view of England’s floodplains and their capabilities.\n“We have ignored our floodplains,” said George Heritage of Salford University, co-author of the study the Changing Face of Floodplains, published by Co-Op Insurance on Thursday. “The changes to them mean water [from heavy rainfall] can flow much faster downstream, and can flow at the same speed as the water in the rivers.”\nThis accelerated flow has led to sudden and unstoppable deluges in recent years. For instance, Storm Desmond in 2015 affected more than 6,000 homes as rivers and streams burst their banks and spread water over floodplains. As these natural floodplains had been altered by man-made features, they no longer had the ability to store water, leading to rapid flows into urban areas which led to the devastation.\nStorm Desmond caused more than £500m in damages, and misery for families excluded from their homes sometimes for months. The UK’s flooding bills are on the rise, with scientists warning of rocketing numbers of cloudbursts and periods of sudden and intense rainfall as climate change takes effect.\nFloodplains act as natural “sponges”, soaking up excess water in their vegetation, forming natural buffers that hold back or divert rushing water after rain, and providing areas where rivers can breach their banks and wetlands can be replenished.\nIntensive agriculture, increasing urbanisation, poor management of rivers and the draining of wetlands have left the vast majority of these natural features – many previously preserved for centuries by communities who understood their value – unable to fulfil these valuable functions, with some close to collapse.\nBuilding on floodplains has been singled out for years as a key problem, but perhaps surprisingly was found to contribute only about a tenth of the damage in the study. Far greater is intensive farming, which has created artificially “smooth” and uniform landscapes, with hedgerows removed, large areas given over to single crops, wetlands drained and woods and grassland diminished. Farming accounts for nearly two-thirds of the loss of functioning floodplains, according to the study.\nNatural floodplains cover about 5% of England, from upland areas and tablelands to low-lying marshes, such as the Somerset levels and the East Anglian fens. Once they were used for grazing for parts of the year, or left uncultivated. However, the exploitation of such areas accelerated in the middle of the last century, when wetlands were drained, hedgerows grubbed up and small farms gave way to bigger farming enterprises.\nToday, the report found, 90% of England’s floodplains no longer function properly, with 65% modified by agriculture “meaning they’re now man-made, smoother surfaces”; 9% lost to urban and suburban building developments; 4% are now occupied by open water and 6% by semi-natural woodland and rough grassland; and only 0.5% is now natural or semi-natural wetland.\n“It would be almost impossible to return the altered areas to their original state,” noted Heritage. “But it is possible to work with farmers to introduce features that would allow them to function better.”\nThese can include restoring hedgerows, which act as a brake on surface water, in place of wire fences or missing field barriers helps, as does keeping or replanting natural vegetation, and encouraging mixed use rather than uniform monoculture. These methods can also benefit farmers, by retaining topsoil that is easily washed away by flooding.\nGood management is also essential: for instance, big trees growing near rivers can exacerbate flood damage, because they can fall into rivers. Traditional methods of pollarding trees result in smaller but stouter growth and more stable root structures, providing more robust river banks that can resist breaking.\n“We would definitely see economic benefits,” from these changes, said Heritage.\nEven small gains can be significant: Heritage said research had found floodplain restoration efforts could slow the speed of water flow by 10-15%, which may be enough to give vital breathing space for downstream communities as they cope with the impact of river flooding.\nMartin Rogers, flood management adviser at the National Farmers’ Union, which assisted with the response to Storm Desmond, said: “Farmers are happy to play their role to reduce flood risk [in Cumbria]. However, natural flood management is not the only solution and we believe should only be used as part of a cohesive package of measures across the catchment. Where farmers provide a service in mitigating flood risk to help protect others, this must be part of a clear, planned strategy.”\nCaroline Russell, the Green Party candidate challenging Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn in his Islington North constituency, said taxpayer payments to farmers should depend on providing such services.\n“Farming subsidies should be used to make sure land is used to store water. We have completely messed up our floodplains, we are getting more water from climate change, and there is nowhere for the water to go. Land in the countryside has to work differently to protect the built-up areas from flooding,” she told the Greener UK Hustings conference on Tuesday in London.\nFlooding, along with other environmental issues, has received little attention in most areas during the general election campaign.\nThe Environment Agency runs an online service allowing people to sign up to receive any flood warnings in their areas, and other basic advice includes putting aside emergency equipment such as torches and batteries, candles and matches, as well as non-perishable food and waterproof clothing.\nDrawing up a “flood plan” is also advised, setting out actions including moving pets to safety, looking out for neighbours, taking treasured possessions upstairs, filling baths, sinks and containers with tapwater in case clean water supplies are shut down, and charging mobile phones immediately a warning is received.","|The graphic shows the early stages of the Izu-Bonin subduction zone. The active subduction zone has been moving eastwards throughout its history. The drilling took place where the process has begun. Credit: Philipp Brandl, GEOMAR|\nAbout 2000 kilometers east of the Philippine Islands lies one of the most famous topographical peculiarities of the oceans: the Mariana trench. Reaching depths of up to 11,000 meters below sea level, it holds the record as the deepest point of the world's ocean. This 4000-kilometer-long trench extends from the Mariana Islands in the south through the Izu-Bonin Islands to Japan in the north.\nHere, the Pacific Plate is subducted beneath the Philippine Sea Plate, resulting in intense volcanic activity and a high number of earthquakes. The entire area is part of the \"Pacific Ring of Fire.\"\nBut when and how exactly did the subduction of the Pacific Plate begin? This is a controversial topic among scientists. An international team led by the GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research Kiel, the Japan Agency for Marine Earth Science and Technology (JAMSTEC) and the Australian National University investigated this early phase of subduction along the Izu-Bonin-Mariana trench, with findings published in the March edition of the scientific journal Earth and Planetary Science Letters.\nThe team of the JOIDES RESOLUTION was able to drill more than 1600 meters deep on the seabed, starting at a water depth of around 4700 meters below sea level. \"This is already at the limit of the technically feasible,\" emphasizes Dr. Brandl. Based on analysis of this drill core, the researchers were able to trace the history of the subduction zone layer by layer up to the approximately 50 million year-old rocks at the bottom of the core, which are typical for the birth of a subduction zone. \"There has not been such a complete overview yet,\" says Dr. Brandl.\nBrandl and his colleagues were now able to acquire and analyze microscopic inclusions of cooled magma from the rocks. The data obtained provide the scientists with insights into the history of volcanic activity at the Pacific Ring of Fire 30-40 million years ago. The researchers found evidence that volcanism was only beginning to gain momentum. The volcanic activity intensified with the rollback of the subduction zone towards the east and the huge explosive stratovolcanoes formed, similar to those present nowadays, for example along the western rim of the Pacific Ring of Fire.\nHowever, further drilling is necessary to test the validity of these observations. \"The more drill cores we can gain from such old strata, the better we learn to understand our own planet,\" Dr. Brandl says. The question of how subduction zones develop is not only interesting to understand the history of the earth. Subduction zones are the drivers for the chemical exchange between the earth's surface and the earth's interior. \"The dynamics of a subduction zone can thus also influence the speed of global elemental cycles,\" summarizes Dr. Brandl.\nThe above post is reprinted from Materials provided by Helmholtz Centre for Ocean Research Kiel (GEOMAR)."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:3d773b20-4625-492e-af82-cf1fa5d7a13e>","<urn:uuid:5c6d44f4-5635-4e24-b63f-750262c58302>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Why did the citrus bacterial canker eradication program ultimately fail in Florida? Looking for the main factors behind this!","answer":"The citrus bacterial canker eradication program in Florida failed due to several key factors: 1) Delays in tree removal caused by homeowners refusing to comply or provide access to properties, combined with limited initial resources. 2) Legal battles that resulted in moratoriums on tree removal, allowing the disease to spread to new areas. 3) Tropical storms and hurricanes that enabled optimal bacterial spread through wind and rain. 4) Florida's lack of geographical barriers like mountains. 5) The absence of an effective public relations campaign, particularly in ethnic residential areas.","context":["Citrus Bacterial Canker: Outbreaks and Regulatory Response\nCitrus bacterial canker (CBC), caused by Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (syn. X. campestris pv. citri, X. axonopodis pv. citri) has been introduced into Florida several times. Below is a brief history of the detection of CBC in Florida and the responses mounted by the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services Division of Plant Industry (FDACS-DPI) and US Department of Agriculture Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS).\n1910: Trifoliate rootstock infected with the Asian or “A” strain of the bacterium were brought into Florida from Japan. The response to CBC detection included the implementation of a quarantine to prevent the movement of citrus plants, the destruction of over three million nursery plants, and the removal of over a quarter million field trees. Eradication was declared a success in 1933 and regulatory detection surveys have continued to the present day since this initial CBC outbreak.\n1984: An outbreak of citrus bacterial spot, caused by a less virulent strain (“E” strain) (now X. alfalfae subsp. citrumelonis) was detected on nursery stock. Over twenty million citrus plants were destroyed.\n1986 to 1994: The “A” strain was detected in residential citrus in the Tampa Bay area and in nearby commercial groves. For the first time, not only were infected trees destroyed but also all exposed host plants within 38 m (125 ft). Also for the first time, residential trees were eradicated. After the destruction of 600 residential trees and almost 90,000 production trees, and no further detections for a two-year period, an official declaration of successful eradication was made in 1994. Regulations were suspended.\n1995: The “A” strain of the CBC agent was detected on residential citrus in the vicinity of the Miami International Airport. It is believed that the appearance of CBC in commercial citrus resulted from spread out of residential sources. An eradication program was initiated immediately, and quarantine regulations were re-instated. The protocol required removing or buckhorning (removal of all green aboveground tissue, also known as hat-racking) all potential hosts within 38 m (125 ft) of an infected tree. After one year, the infection level remained too high to continue with the buckhorn protocol and it was suspended. In late 1996, all exposed trees had to be removed. Resources were quickly depleted; the program was under-staffed, the quarantine area rapidly expanded to 93,499 ha (361 mi2). The situation was exacerbated by the detection of CBC in another area in west central Florida. The isolate from this area was found to be genetically identical to the isolate responsible for the 1984 outbreak, which indicated that CBC had not been successfully eradicated after all. In early 1998, the Florida Commissioner of Agriculture and the Citrus Canker Eradication Program (CCEP) declared a moratorium on the\nremoval of exposed citrus trees because a judge stopped tree removal in response to homeowner lawsuits using standards in effect at the time. Homeowners were opposed to removal of trees that were not infected without evidence that they could be sources of inoculum. During the moratorium, the bacteria quickly spread and additional sites were discovered in southwest Florida. During this 12-month study period, the 1,900 ft rule (580 meter radius) was created which expanded the quarantine to 129,500 h (500 mi2) with a program budget of $9.5 million. By 2000, the Persian lime industry in south Florida had been destroyed (Schubert et al., 2001).\n2004: The three hurricanes and a tropical storm that crossed the Florida peninsula dispersed the pathogen even further across the state (Irey et al., 2006a; Gottwald and Irey, 2007); resulting in the establishment of new infections at substantial distances from the known existing infections. Survey and eradication efforts by the FDACS and USDA-APHIS became even more intense to eliminate new outbreaks before the next hurricane season.\nThe FDACS and USDA-APHIS simultaneously employed the following survey protocols: the sentinel grove survey (based on sentinel commercial blocks of susceptible cultivars), the targeted grove survey (based on meteorological data that used a GIS-weather model to predict the direction of disease spread due to hurricanes), the delimiting grove survey (which was performed once new infections were discovered) and the self survey (performed by the grower). Production managers and other workers that are in contact with commercial citrus on a daily basis were trained by a joint University of Florida and FDACS-DPI program to search for, recognize, and report suspicious symptoms to FDACS-DPI or USDA-APHIS inspectors for confirmation.\nNot all citrus canker-infected trees detected in 2004 had been removed by the time the first hurricane (Hurricane Wilma) hit the Florida peninsula in October 2005. Of the 80,000 acres of commercial citrus identified as affected after the 2004 season, 32,000 acres remained even with the removal of 120,000 trees per week. It was estimated that an additional 168,000 to 220,000 acres of commercial citrus would have to be destroyed after the 2005 hurricane season under the 1900-foot protocol. At this point in time, the annual federal appropriation to maintain the program was $36 million. Eradication costs significantly increased from $10 million in 1996 to $50 million in 1999. In 2000, program costs escalated to $145 million. A panel of USDA scientists and global experts in citrus diseases conferred and concluded that the disease was now so widely distributed that eradication was not feasible.\nOn January 11, 2006 the USDA issued a press release stating that it would discontinue all efforts to eradicate canker. Subsequently, the Florida House of Representatives decided to halt the eradication campaign and repeal the 1900-foot protocol on May 3, 2006. However, because of the value of the fresh fruit industry and not every citrus production area in Florida was severely infected, there was still considerable support from the production industry to continue with a revised management program. Hence, the concept of a State-Federal-Commercial Industry Citrus Health Response Plan was launched. It is based on best management practices, living with the disease while minimizing production losses, and the implementation of a quarantine that prohibits the movement of fruit from known-infected areas of the state to non-infected areas and to other citrus-producing states. This plan has evolved into a National program, the Citrus Health Response Program, and is administered by the USDA-APHIS. USDA-APHIS has recently lifted the quarantine on Florida fresh fruit after findings that commercial fruit is not an important means of spread of the disease, thus allowing growers more flexibility in marketing their fruit.\nFactors contributing to the failure of the Canker Eradication Program include:\nTime required for tree removal: A few homeowners refused to comply with tree removal or provide access to residential properties, and initial resources (manpower, vehicles, and funding) were limited.\nWhile legal battles for tree removal were being fought, inoculum sources remained during the declaration of moratorium in 1998 and the disease spread to new areas of the state through human movement.\nTropical storms and hurricanes were optimal for bacterial spread (bacterial cells blown long distances by wind and carried in rain drops).\nFlorida lacks geographical barriers such as mountains.\nLack of a positive public relations campaign especially in ethnic residential areas.\nLessons for huanglongbing (HLB) learned from the canker experience:\nImportance of disease-free sources of citrus propagation material and nursery stock.\nEradication actions taken at the first detection of Asian citrus psyllid (ACP) in 1998 might possibly have slowed ACP spread and delayed HLB’s incursion (although ACP control efforts elsewhere have not been very successful).\nIntensive surveys for the Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus pathogen, if conducted in 1998, might have stimulated action to slow the spread of HLB.\nEffective public outreach campaigns help to make the urban sector part of the solution to maintaining the commercial industry.\nWhile plant pathogens and their vectors and insect pests are part of biology, their implications enter the realm of social and political arenas. The urban sector does not always trust scientists or regulatory personnel. These should be taken into consideration when developing a public outreach campaign.\nMassive amounts of funding do not always solve the problem."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:53b3609d-acc8-465e-81c5-299bceb10c48>"],"error":null}

For example, what are the key restrictions in each case?","answer":"Military working dogs classified as 'equipment' must return to their original base with no funding provided for transportation elsewhere, and cannot be transported on cargo planes free of charge. They rely on donations for transportation. In contrast, pets traveling between the US and Mexico have more flexibility - they can freely cross borders by car as long as the owner has proper documentation like a Tourist Visa (FMM) and Temporary Import Permit (TIP) for their vehicle. The TIP allows driving outside free zones and can be obtained online, at borders, or at certain Mexican consulates.","context":["Military Working Dogs: What Happens When They Retire?\n“Many soldiers have their todays and can plan their tomorrows because of what a Military Working Dog did for them yesterday.”\nThis is the motto for Military Working Dog Adoptions, an organization run by a dedicated volunteer, Debbie Kandoll.\nIn 2008 Debbie adopted her first ex-military dog. With that single step, Kandoll became totally hooked on the fact that someone—her—needed to put some muscle behind solving the problem of how we treat our canine vets.\nThis is a topic I have covered frequently over the years, but when I was teaching my “America’s Stories through Its Dogs” class at UCLA and looking for guest speakers, my friend Robert Semrow, who hosts Pet World Insider, told me to be sure to contact Debbie Kandoll about the plight of military dogs. I thought I had pretty well covered the subject but Robert was correct—there was a lot more to know.\nA Little Background\nDogs embedded with troops are absolutely life-changing for the soldiers. Even when dogs were brought along as mascots, they heard things before the soldiers and alerted the unit to the fact that something was going on; many attacked enemies when they sensed danger. (Read about Sgt. Stubby from World War I or Sallie during the Civil War.)\nYet we had no canine unit until World War II when a dog breeder, Alene Erlanger began a program asking for people to donate their pets to serve in the military. Families did.\nNo Discharge Plan\nWhat was lacking was any sort of exit plan for the dogs. After World War II, a veterinarian named Bill Putney took on the re-training of dogs to return them to civilian life, but Putney knew there needed to be a formal program. (During Vietnam, American military dogs were either euthanized or left in Vietnam to fend for themselves.)\nPutney, who ran a veterinary practice in southern California, spent 50 years working to get a bill passed by Congress (2001) that stops the practice of euthanizing these dogs or abandoning them after they have served in the military. Putney was one of many who knew this was no way to treat these veterans.\nThe bill also provides for handlers to re-train their dogs and adopt them if they so choose.\nBut there was a catch that I didn’t pick up on initially.\nWhat I Learned from Debbie Kandoll\nBecause the bill—heavily supported by Senator John McCain—classifies the dogs as “equipment,” there are a host of problems. When any type of “equipment” is taken out of service, it goes back to the base where it originated. So if a dog began his tour of duty at a base in Germany, he is returned to that base, with no funds to send him or place him elsewhere.\nThis leaves it up to organizations like Military Working Dog Adoptions to solicit donations—cash or airline miles—to bring the dogs to the U.S. where a home can be found. Or if the handler wants to adopt, to deliver the dog to the handler who may be on another overseas assignment.\nThere is also no provision for medical benefits for these canine veterans. As Debbie says, “It would be a good start if an owner could take the dog to a veterinarian on a base and get the service\n“As it is, here are dogs who have risked their lives—and their health—to save the lives of our military, and we, as a country, have made no provision to take care of them,” says Kandoll.\nKandoll Visits UCLA with Three of her Dogs\nDebbie Kandoll was living in Las Cruces, New Mexico when I called her, and when she heard about my class, she immediately offered to drive from New Mexico to Los Angeles with three of her dogs to tell their story. (That’s the kind of devotion Debbie gives to this cause.)\nSo in April of this year my class and I were spellbound by Debbie and her three extraordinary dogs. We met Luke M560 ( USA, Ret.) , Alex H116 (USAF, Ret.), and Suzy Q, a PTSD Service Dog.\nThe photos give you a flavor of the wonderful time we had. The dogs clearly have eyes for only one person who was with us that day. It was, of course, Debbie, who put them through some of their paces and then let us pet and enjoy the dogs to our heart’s content. We had a good number of drop-in visitors, and the class continued on for an extra hour and a half, we enjoyed her—and them—so much.\nActions Debbie Suggests:\n1. Donate to the cause. Debbie’s organization is entirely dependent on donations, and she is a 501(c)3. The money goes to help bring these dogs from a base to a potential home—often their original handler. The money also goes toward medical expenses for these veterans. www.MilitaryWorkingDogAdoptions.com\n2. Write to your Congressional representatives. Ask that these animals be re-classified from “equipment” to “canine members of the Armed Forces.” This would permit them to be transported to the U.S. on cargo planes at no charge (an option not available with the “equipment” classification.) It would also open discussion re: getting medical care for these vets.\n3. If you would like to adopt one of these dogs, there are applications on the website.\nDebbie also maintains an active facebook page where you can keep up with her whereabouts: www.facebook.com/MilitaryWorkingDogAdoptions","How To Drive Your Dog or Cat into Mexico from the US and Back\nTo drive with Dogs or Cats to Mexico from the US or Canada, Mexico does not require a Health Certificate or Rabies Certificate. Mexico is not a high-risk Rabies country (CDC). Your Pet may be visually inspected for health at the border. Car Insurance (minimum Liability only) is required.\nTo drive with to Mexico from a US border, Mexican Law does not require a Health Certificate or Rabies Certificate. Car Insurance (minimum Liability only) is required. Mexico is not a high-risk Dog Rabies country (CDC). Your Pet may be visually inspected for health at the border.\nTo Return to the US from Mexico with a Pet Dog or Cat, you likely will need a Pet Health Certificate Vaccination Record, Rabies Certificate, (Parasite Treatment is recommended).\nDriving to Mexico with Pets from the US or Canada\nA. Dog and Cat Requirements:\n1.No, Health Certificate is required if traveling from the US or Canada\n2. No, Rabies or other vaccinations,\n3. No parasite treatment is required (screwworm, fleas, ticks mite, lice etc.),\n4. Your pet may be physically inspected at the border, but often is not inspected.\nNOTE: If you return, you will need these documents with you in case you are asked upon reentry to the US or enter to another country. Plans changes and if you need to fly back to the US you will need them for the airline.\nYou can confirm these requirements on the USDA/APHIS official website.\nAnd here on Mexico’s Gobiernos De Mexico official website.\nB. Your and Your Vehicle/Car Requirements\nDOCUMENTATION FOR YOUR VEHICLE : You will present a passport or US ID card/driver’s license and get a Tourist Visa (FMM) for you and a Temporary Import Pass (TIP) for your vehicle, (Except Baja Peninsular where no TIP is required). A TIP is tied to your immigration document and is valid for as long your immigration document is valid.\nA TIP is legal document that allows a foreign-plated vehicle to be imported to and driven in Mexico for a defined period of time. The vehicle must be exported (driven out of Mexico) before the TIP’s expiry date.\nIf you fail to export the vehicle and surrender/cancel the TIP, you will lose your deposit, you will not be allowed to import another vehicle in future; and you can also face fines and have your vehicle confiscated.\nAnyone who wants to bring a foreign-plated vehicle into Mexico and drive outside of the Free Zones. The Free Zones are:\n- within 25km of the land border;\n- the entire Baja California peninsula;\n- a defined area in the northern state of Sonora; and,\n- the southern state of Quintana Roo.\nIf you are going to drive your car farther than the 25km from the border or anywhere outside of a defined Free Zone, you must have a TIP to avoid fines and confiscation of the vehicle.\nWhere Can I Buy Temporary Import Permit (TIP) to Travel with My Pet to Mexico?\nThere are three ways: Online, At the Border, at the Mexican Consulate\nYou can still obtain a TIP in-person at the border but applying for the TIP via the Banjercito site will speed the process and avoid potentially long lines at the border.\nNote: If you apply online, you must first get your FMM online (or have your Residency visa or card issued) before you obtain the TIP. When you get your FMM online, you must stop at the border and get immigration (INM) to stamp/validate the document. Carry a printed copy of the FMM and your receipt to show proof of payment when you do this.\nWhen approved, you will receive your TIP by email. Print out your TIP and receipt and keep the printed copies with you while driving in Mexico. Keep and use the email version only as verification of your TIP approval.\n2. In person at a Land Border\nTemporary import permits may be purchased at CIITEV offices located at Customs offices near various U.S./Mexico border locations in Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas.\nCheck beforehand that the crossing you use has a CIITEV office. When you apply in person, Banjercito will send an email with your TIP and hand you a printed copy of the TIP and your receipt.\nKeep the email and paper copies to hand at all times while driving in Mexico.\n3. Buying a TIP at a Mexican Consulate\nA limited number of Mexican Consulates in the United States offer a TIP-issuing service. Although the Consulate acts as facilitator, it is Banjercito that issues the permit.\nConsulates in the following US States offer TIPs (we recommend you contact them beforehand to ensure that their TIP issuing service is available):\n- Arizona: Phoenix\n- California: Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Sacramento\n- Colorado: Denver\n- Illinois: Chicago\n- New Mexico: Albuquerque\n- Texas: Austin, Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston\nBANJERCITO is the government authority that issues vehicle permits allowing you to travel with Pets from US to Mexico. The process can be done online, at the Mexican border, or at certain Mexican consulates in the U.S.\nThe process involves leaving a monetary deposit that will be returned upon the cancellation of vehicle permit when leaving Mexico.\nAuto Insurance for Your Pet Road Trip to Mexico\nYou are required to have a Mexican Insurance policy or to show proof of financial responsibility. Financial responsibility is proof of liquid funds (not credit cards) in case of accident.\nYour US or Canadian auto insurance policy won’t cover you for third-party liability in Mexico. Most US or Canadian policies include coverage for damage to your vehicle and its contents—not coverage for another vehicle in an accident.\nThe most important aspect of an insurance policy for driving in Mexico is third-party liability. By law, US and Canadian insurers are prohibited from providing liability coverage in foreign countries.\nLiability coverage must be underwritten by a Mexican insurance company.\nWhat Other Documents Do I Need to Drive My Pets to Mexico from the US?\nAll foreigners visiting Mexico must fill out an Official Entry Immigration Form, also called a Tourist Card, prior to their arrival. (Forma Migratoria Multiple or FMM),\nTourist cards are free and you can fill out and print the form at home. Keep this with you as you will need it to return or travel onto South and Central America\nWhen you arrive at the border, present the immigration officer with your printed tourist card and your passport. Since your information will already be in their system, once your tourist card is stamped, you’ll be off to enjoy Mexico!\nIf you are walking across the border into Mexico, you might find the immigration officer doesn’t request your tourist card. Still, it’s better to have it prepared – just in case.\nVisitors to Mexico for leisure or business visits lasting 180 days or less, and who are passport holders of one of the many countries which don’t require a visa to enter Mexico can complete a visitors permit, known as Forma Migratoria Multiple or FMM, at their port of entry.\nIf you drive to Mexico, you will need to get a visitors permit at the port of entry;\nIf you fly to Mexico, air crews on international flights might hand-out the visitor permit forms before the flight lands, and they are also available at Mexican airports, near the immigration desks\nYou can get your FMM online and print this out to take with you; the official at the port of entry will stamp the printed form. See Here to Apply Online for your FMM\nIf you are visiting a Mexican port(s) as part of a cruise ship, you’ll need to get a visitors permit at your first Mexican port of call.\n(If the country that issued your passport appears on this list of countries which do require a visa for Mexico, read this.)\nHow Much Does a Mexico’s Visitor Visa (FMM) Cost?\nIf you arrive by land and leave Mexico within 7 days of your arrival date, there is no fee for the permit. If you fly into Mexico from overseas, the fee is usually included within your air ticket’s “fees and surcharges.” The fee is approximately US$25.\nKeep Your Visitors Permit (FMM) Safe\nOnce completed, the immigration official at the port of entry will stamp both halves of the form and hand you the smaller half, stamped with the date you entered the country. It’s important to keep this document safe, as you will need to surrender it when you leave Mexico.\nIf you are departing Mexico on a flight, your airline will insist you surrender your stamped half of the Visitors Permit to them before they allow you to board.\nIf you have a Visitors Permit and are leaving the country by land you should voluntarily surrender your form to an immigration official before your departure. Failure to do so might cause delays the next time you try and enter Mexico.\nHow long can I stay in Mexico with a Visitors Permit (FMM)?\nYour visitor permit is valid for the number of days granted by the immigration official and written on the permit —that will never exceed 180 days, but may be less than 180 days— starting from the date of your arrival. The arrival date is always stamped on the permit.\nThe number of Days you are allowed depends on your statement of reason for travel. For example: if you have hotel reservations in Cancun for two weeks, you may be given 14-20 days. If you are visiting friends and are unsure, you can ask for longer. If you traveling on business, searching for a second home etc. you can ask for more.Conde Nast Traveler\nYour Visa on Arrival in Mexico length of stay is no longer assumed to be 180 days (6 months). In 2022, Mexico is tailoring each Visa on Arrival depending on the Immigration Officer’s assessment of your specific needs.\nThis allowance is given per entry: every time you exit and re-enter Mexico on another date the allowance ‘resets.’ (You surrender your current FMM when you leave and get a new FMM when you return.)\n- When you enter Mexico as a tourist or visitor, to volunteer, or as a business visitor, then the immigration official at the port of entry may grant you a maximum 180 days to stay in Mexico.\n- The number of days you are allowed to stay will be written on the part of the form that’s handed to you for safe-keeping.\n- The date stamped on your permit is your arrival date.\n- To determine the latest date you must leave Mexico, count the number days (some months are longer than others) from the arrival date stamped on your form.\nWhat If Your Pet Has Health Issues at the US Mexico Border?\nYou Pet may be inspected for general health at the border. If there are signs of disease or wounds, you may need to wait while you contact a local Veterinarian to arrive and treat your Pet.\nIf your pet is being treated for lesions and/or infections due to a skin condition, present the SENASICA agent with the diagnosis and treatment instructions from your veterinarian.\nThis information should be presented on letterhead, including the veterinarian’s professional registration number (or equivalent)\nIf you and your Dog or Cat frequently travel between the U.S. and Mexico, consider registering in the “Pet Program – Frequent Traveler.” For further information, refer to the USDA website.\nBringing Pet Food into Mexico\nMexico allows a limited amount of pet food for you to carry with you. A supply of one day’s meals is suggested.\nMexico has many of the same brands of Pet food as we find in the US. Mexico has many of the same retailers for Pet Supplies such as Costco, Petsmarts and Walmart.\nAlso, many Veterinarians make house calls in Mexico if your Pet needs medical attention.\nDriving Back to the US from Mexico with Your Pets\nDOGS: Dogs that have not been in a high-risk country in the previous 6 months are not required by CDC to present a rabies vaccination certificate or other paperwork, but vaccination against rabies is required. (CDC).\nCATS: A Health Certificate is not required by the US Centers for Disease Control (CDC) for entry of pet cats into the United States, although some airlines or states may require them.\nHowever, pet cats are subject to inspection at ports of entry and may be denied entry into the United States if they have evidence of an infectious disease that can be transmitted to humans.\nIf a cat appears to be ill, further examination by a licensed veterinarian at the owner’s expense might be required at the port of entry.\nCats are not required to have proof of rabies vaccination for importation into the United States.\nReturning Home With Your Pet\nBringing your Dog or Cat back to the U.S. from Mexico\nThe CDC has strict guidelines on Dogs entering the U.S. from countries that have a high risk of Dog rabies. 113 countries are on this list – Mexico is NOT a High Risk Rabies Country.\nNo matter what country you are coming from, the US requires an up-to-date rabies certificate be presented upon entering with a pet.\nPet Inspection at the US and Mexico Border\nYour pet may be physically inspected. It must be healthy. If the pet does not appear healthy (sickly, fresh or healing wounds) you will likely be turned away. Mexico recognizes only Dogs and Cats as pets. All other animals enter under other rules.\nSENASICA inspectors are not present at every crossing. In fact, many travelers report to us that there are very few. Still, it is possible. It is good practice to have all your Pet’s documentation with you.\nOnce in a while, travelers find themselves in an emergency and need to fly back to the States with their Pet. Pets will be inspected at airports. See AEROMEXICO-Flying with Pets to Mexico or VOLARIS-Flying With Pets to Mexico\nTIP: A “Pet Passport” is not an official document as are human passports. A “Pet Passport” is all the documentation you pet may need for travel: ID, Photo, Health Certificate, Vaccination records, Rabies Certificate, Parasite Prevention documentation and Medication.\nTIP: WAZE App can be very effective alternative to Google Maps. Mexican use Whatsapp as their primary means to message everyone: Veterinarians, Shopkeepers, Hotels, Restaurants and friends.\nDo Dogs and Cats Need a Health Certificate to Travel to Mexico?\nNo. If you are traveling from the USA or Canada, your Pet (Dog or Cat) does not need a Pet Health Certificate.

{"question":"How do the genetic variations from ancient human relatives affect modern humans differently in Tibet versus other populations? Could you compare the impact of Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA on health and adaptation?","answer":"Neanderthal and Denisovan DNA have had different impacts on modern populations. For Tibetans, Denisovan DNA provided a crucial adaptation through the EPAS1 gene variant, which helps them thrive at high altitudes by preventing dangerous effects of altitude sickness and protecting pregnant mothers. This variant is present in about 90% of Tibetans but only 10% of Han Chinese. Meanwhile, Neanderthal DNA (present in 1.5-2.1% of non-African DNA) influences different health aspects, including increased risks of heart attacks, depression, nicotine addiction, and skin lesions. Some Neanderthal variants that were initially beneficial, like increased blood clotting, may now be detrimental in modern Western environments.","context":["Ancient trysts between Neanderthals and modern humans may have influenced modern risks for depression, heart attacks, nicotine addiction, obesity and other health problems, researchers said.\nThe Neanderthals were once the closest relatives of modern humans. Scientists recently discovered that Neanderthals and modern humans once interbred; nowadays, about 1.5 to 2.1 percent of DNA in people outside Africa is Neanderthal in origin.\n\"This raises several fascinating questions like, 'What effect does the Neanderthal DNA that remains in modern humans have on our biology?'\" said study senior author John Capra, an evolutionary geneticist at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. [See Photos of Our Closest Human Ancestor]\nNow, for the first time, researchers have directly compared Neanderthal DNA with the clinical records of a significant portion of adults of European ancestry. The scientists discovered that this archaic genetic legacy has had a subtle but significant impact on modern human biology, they said.\n\"Neanderthal DNA influences a broad range of traits relevant to disease risk in modern humans,\" Capra told Live Science.\nThe researchers first identified about 135,000 Neanderthal genetic variations found in modern humans. Next, the scientists analyzed a database of more than 28,000 adults of European ancestry from the Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network, a consortium of nine hospitals across the United States. This data linked patient genetic data with versions of those individuals' electronic health records that were stripped of identifying details such as names and addresses.\nThe data helped the researchers determine if each person had ever been treated for medical conditions such as heart disease, arthritis and depression. It also helped the scientists determine what Neanderthal genetic variants each person carried.\nUltimately, the researchers found that Neanderthal genetic variants were significantly linked to increased risk of 12 traits, including heart attack and artery thickening.\nSurprisingly, the investigators also found a Neanderthal genetic variant that significantly increased the modern human risk for nicotine addiction, the researchers said. However, this does not mean that Neanderthals smoked tobacco, Capra said.\n\"Tobacco was found solely in the Western Hemisphere until Europeans brought it back from expeditions to the Americas,\" Capra said. The Neanderthal DNA that boosts the risk of nicotine addiction may have had a completely different and potentially beneficial effect \"that exhibited itself 50,000 years ago,\" Capra said.\nSome of the scientists' discoveries confirm previous ideas. For example, earlier research suggested that Neanderthal DNA influenced skin cells known as keratinocytes that help protect the skin from environmental damage such as ultraviolet radiation and germs. The new findings suggest that Neanderthal genetic variants increase the risk of developing sun-triggered skin lesions known as keratoses, which are caused by abnormal keratinocytes.\n\"When we started this study, we expected that if we found anything at all, we would find an influence of Neanderthal DNA on bodily systems that are involved in interactions with the environment,\" Capra said. \"We hypothesized this because Neanderthals had been living in Central Asia and Europe for hundreds of thousands of years before our recent ancestors ever reached these areas — and thus had likely adapted to the distinct environmental aspects of these regions, compared to Africa, in terms of climate, plants and animals, and pathogens.\"\nCapra and his colleagues also found that a number of Neanderthal genetic variants influenced the risk for depression, with some variants increasing the risk and others reducing it.\n\"The brain is incredibly complex, so it's reasonable to expect that introducing changes from a different evolutionary path might have negative consequences,\" study lead author Corinne Simonti, a graduate student of human genetics at Vanderbilt University, said in a statement.\"\nThe researchers suggest that some Neanderthal genetic variants might have provided benefits in modern human populations as they first moved out of Africa thousands of years ago. However, those variants may have later become detrimental in modern, Western environments, the scientists said. One example is Neanderthal DNA that increases blood clotting; while this can help seal wounds and prevent germs from entering the body, it can also increase the risk for stroke, miscarriage and other problems, Capra said.\nThe researchers suggest that Neanderthal DNA may not have contributed to differences in skin colors between modern humans, unlike what previous research has suggested. Instead, differences in modern human skin color probably developed very recently, Capra said. \"Neanderthals may also have had a range of skin colors,\" Capra added.\nFuture research can compare Neanderthal DNA with data gleaned from other sources of medical information, such as lab tests, doctors' notes and medical images, the researchers said. \"There is still much to learn about the effects of interbreeding on different populations in recent human history,\" Capra said.\nThe scientists detailed their findings online Feb. 11 in the journal Science.\n- In Photos: New Human Ancestor Possibly Unearthed in Spanish Cave\n- Denisovan Gallery: Tracing the Genetics of Human Ancestors\n- In Photos: Neanderthal Burials Uncovered\nCopyright 2016 LiveScience, a Purch company.

Tibetans — and Denisovans, presumably — have a copy that isn’t very efficient at higher altitudes. That means that while people with “sea level” variants fill up their circulatory systems to bursting with more oxygen-depleted blood, Tibetans’ circulatory systems remain at a more relaxed state. In consequence, they don’t get the high blood pressure and other dangerous effects of altitude sickness that other people tend to get.\nMany Tibetans (almost 90% of them) share a “high altitude” variant allele of EPAS1, while most Han Chinese (more than 90% of them) share a “sea level” variant. What’s more, the “high-altitude” variant is so similar to the variant sequenced from a Denisovan bone fragment — and so different from the “sea level” variant — that it is exceptionally unlikely to come from anywhere except Denisovans.\nWhat does this mean for human evolution?\nWhat it doesn’t mean is that Tibetans are “more Denisovan” than are Han Chinese. In fact, neither of these populations shares large portions of their genome with Denisovans in general. Of the populations examined, only Melanesians share significant portions of their DNA (around 5%) with Denisovan man. This one gene is part of perhaps 0.1% of the genome of mainland Asian or other non-African humans that is shared with Denisovans. And this allele is present in both populations, just at very different levels (10% versus 90%).\nPractically, this means that a tiny portion of the human genome, as people migrated east out of Africa, came from interbreeding with the Denisovan lineage. That’s true for the ancestor of Han Chinese as well as Tibetans (in fact, it’s the same ancestor).\nThe difference between the populations arises because one allele of one gene (the “high altitude” variant of EPAS1) became very advantageous when these humans started living in the Tibetan plateau, where the air has only about 60% as much oxygen as you’d find at sea level. In particular, the “high altitude” variant of EPAS1 protects pregnant mothers and developing fetuses: Tibetan populations have significantly lower rates of preterm birth and other diseases of pregnancy than Han Chinese living in Tibet. And since it provides protection at childbearing ages and at birth, this is exactly the kind of variation that would be subject to strong selective pressures.\nWhat it suggests, which hasn’t been known definitively before, is that although we can’t find much Denisovan in non-Melanesian populations, interbreeding with the Denisovan (as well as Neanderthal) lineage was definitely a part of human history.\nA new token example for evolution in humans\nThis is yet another example in human evolution of a low-frequency allele rapidly expanding in frequency because it confers a strong selective advantage. In that way, it’s like variants promoting lactose tolerance, or like amylase duplications making starches more digestible, or variants that provide protection against malaria. But to my mind this may become the new go-to example of human evolution and selection in human populations for several reasons: it’s a distinct variant, with unambiguous selection, and a very fast rise to prominence.\nIt’s a distinct variant because it was inherited whole-cloth from Denisovans. A small number of hybrid families led to some hybrid offspring led to a population with this allele at a low rate. So far it has been inherited as a unit, which simplifies the evolutionary story.\nIt’s a case of unambiguous selection because its major effect is that it promotes survival at high altitudes. There’s no predisposition to sickle cell anemia or beta thalassemia as there is with alleles providing malaria resistance. And it has a big effect on pregnancy and infant mortality — its effect on the number of offspring someone could have, in addition to the number of years that person could live, is obvious.\nAnd it’s a very fast rise to prominence. Han Chinese and Tibetan populations have a recent common ancestor, and they have probably had interbreeding throughout history. The fact that this allele provides such selective pressure that it could rise to 90% prominence in such a short time is absolutely striking.\nGenetic opportunists and the advantage of a big family\nOne of the big biological truisms that gets thrown around a lot but isn’t necessarily well understood is the idea that, to a certain extent, “evolvability” gets selected for. Which is to say that a certain level of diversity in a species is a huge advantage, because it means you can expand to new niches (like the high altitude Tibetan plateau) and the variants that allow you to succeed in that niche will already be present in the population.\nIt’s very easy to see this principle in work in bacteria; when stressed, bacteria often will mutate or disable their DNA damage protection machinery, promoting more mutations and rapidly gaining a huge number of variants. But that doesn’t happen in animals; with a bigger genome and more cells the pressure against cancer is greater than the pressure towards variation.\nPretty much the only thing that animals have to work on there — the only place you can observe this — is (1) large populations and (2) sexual reproduction.\nLarge populations act in animals just like they would in bacteria: more individuals means more individual variants means more sampling of the possible space of genetic variants. Sexual reproduction makes it easier for those variants to recombine and mix and (hopefully) find a fruitful combination.\nIn that light, subspecies like Neanderthal and Densiova were a crucial genetic resource for early humans, providing variation that allowed humans to survive in a wide variety of environments all over the world."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5d54f49a-35b2-49a6-8a4b-423cbcdd36af>","<urn:uuid:4ed0eb87-9de9-4956-873e-14372213b1b9>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How high can beach dunes typically get in undisturbed areas, and how long does it take them to form? 😮 I'm really curious!","answer":"Back beach dunes typically reach 20 to 30 feet in elevation in undisturbed localities. These dunes take several decades to centuries to form.","context":["The berm is the crest of the beach, generally above the average high tide line. The berm represents a general break in slope, above which wave energy reaches only during highest tides in combination with storms. The berm separates the intertidal zone from a generally barren stretch of dry sand and the first dunes. This dry, storm-deposited beach sand is the source of sand for dunes in the back beach area. The surface of the back beach generally becomes littered by the lighter debris blown shoreward from the intertidal zone mixed with materials left behind from storm surges.\nThe back beach area is only flooded during winter storms and during the highest spring tide surges. These events may leave massive amounts of debris piled in the flat back beach area (called \"flotsom\" and \"jetsom\"). Winter coastal winds dry out the back beach area and redistribute some of the sand to the back beach dunes. Back beach dunes frequently reach 20 to 30 feet in elevation in undisturbed localities, and may take several decades to centuries to form. In the past dunes were commonly sacrificed to add sand to beaches and to allow coastal residents a better view. The foolishness of removing dunes is illustrated by a simple evaluation of property damages after a winter storm or hurricane in areas where the dunes have been removed!\nSimilarly, the building of groins and jetties help to trap sand moving with the long shore current. These structures trap sand and benefit the residents on the up- current side of the groin. Unfortunately, the down current side of a groin is then shut off from long shore sediment supply and is subject to erosion, often severe erosion as illustrated by the beachfront community of Westhampton Beach on Long Island!\nThe western-most groin on Westhampton Beach up-current from the devastation zone caused by several nor'easters of the early 1990's. Storm waves and tidal surges demolished as many as 300 residences down current of a excessive groin field constructed by the U.S. Army, Corp of Engineers. The shut off of the longshore sand supply guaranteed the community's destruction.\nBeaches are constantly changing from season to season and year to year. Each year the spits on the end of barrier islands grow longer. Eventually a storm will come along and strip much of the sand away and deposit it on offshore bars or onto the shore of the next island down current. As sea level continues to rise the barrier islands migrate landward. In the New York area is is quite common to find fossils of organisms that inhabited land and back bay and lagoonal environments washing up on the beach. This suggests that the barrier islands have moved landward through time, allowing wave energy to erode the older shore deposits that are now offshore. In regions where tectonic forces are causing the land to slowly rise old beach and barrier islands are left stranded, forming inland ridges parallel to shore. When sand supply increases islands grow, when it is reduced islands erode. The variability of sand supply in the past was a reflection of climate and whether sea level was rising or falling. When the glaciers were rapidly melting huge amounts of sand were contributed to regional shorelines. However, as the sand supply dindled as the glacier receeded, and sea level continued to rise older barrier islands vanished. Sand ridges on the continental shelf are, in part, the eroded remnant of submerged barrier complexes.\nThe modern barriers are quite transient. Historical reports demonstrate that the shoreline has migrated in the order of several miles in some locations along the Atlantic Coast since colonial times. Islands that once existed offshore have vanished. One example in the New York Bight area is Hog Island, a small island that existed off the coast from Rockaway, Queens, NY. It vanished after a hurricane in 1893 (NY Times 3/18/97, p. B1). Other islands existed offshore from Coney Island. These islands were,in-part,demolished by the activities of early settlers disrupted the shore dunes with heavy grazing and cut down the cedar forests in the back beach areas. However, one good hurricane or strong nor'easter can drastically change the coast in one event, with or without the aid of human activity. Evidence for vanished islands along the coast of the New York Bight comes from the occurrence of Indian and colonial artifacts, bones, and the pickled stumps of cedar that frequently wash up on area beaches.\nAnyone who spends time beachcombing will note that more gravel and shell material will accumulate on the upper intertidal zone on the beach when wave energy is low (when local wind energy is low). When the wind is strong the shoreface tends to be covered with a blanket of sand, and gravel and shell material is transported seaward. In general, I find that if there is a breeze greater than 10 miles an hour there is no point in going to the beach to collect artifacts, shells, or fossils.\nReturn to the New York Bight Home Page\nPhil Stoffer and Paula\nCUNY, Earth & Environmental Science, Ph.D. Program\nHunter College, Department of Geography\nBrooklyn College, Department of Geology\nIn cooperation with\nGateway National Recreational Area\nU.S. National Park Service\nCopyright May, 1996 (All rights reserved; use as an educational resource encouraged.)>"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"non_native_learner"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b2778b40-5130-47b0-9de0-d7f5e0e73596>"],"error":null}
{"question":"¿Cuál es el propósito de los mapas de probabilidad y qué desafíos culturales presentan en su interpretación?","answer":"Probability maps are used when there is a critical threshold value of interest, like a national standard level of pollutant, and display the probability that this threshold is exceeded or not exceeded. These maps help identify areas most or least likely to exceed critical thresholds. However, there are cultural challenges in their interpretation - different cultures place different importance on symbols and colors used in maps. For example, while Western cultures may use red to symbolize danger or problematic areas, in China this color would symbolize luck or favorable conditions. This cultural variation in interpretation needs to be considered when creating and using probability maps.","context":["Geostatistical Analyst のライセンスで利用可能。\nAll interpolation models are prediction methods, and the ultimate goal is to produce a surface of predicted values at all locations between the measured locations. Frequently, you also need to know how precise and reliable the predictions are, so Geostatistical Analyst offers several different output surface types to help you interpret the prediction surface while keeping in mind the inherent variability of the predictions. The following sections describe the different output surface types, and the table at the bottom shows which surface types are available for each interpolation method.\nAll output maps assume that you have chosen the correct interpolation method and chosen correct interpolation parameters. In practice, if the data does not meet the assumptions of the interpolation method or the wrong parameters are supplied, these surfaces may not correctly represent the true values of the data.\nAll interpolation methods (except indicator and probability kriging) are capable of creating prediction surfaces, and this is the default output of all interpolation methods. This surface displays the predicted value of the data at all locations between the measured locations.\nPrediction standard error surface\nThe prediction standard error surface is a map of the standard errors of the predicted values at each location. Standard errors are the standard deviation of the estimated value at each location, and the larger the standard error, the lower the precision of the predicted value. Standard errors are most often used to create intervals that are likely to contain the true value at each predicted location.\nThe 68-95-99.7 rule\nIf the data follows a multivariate normal distribution, you can apply a simple rule of thumb to create confidence intervals for the true value at each predicted location. The rule states that 68 percent (approximately two-thirds) of the true values will fall within one standard error of the predicted value, 95 percent will fall within two standard errors, and 99.7 percent (nearly all) will fall within three standard errors. For example, if a location receives a predicted value of 100 with a standard error of 5, you can be 68 percent confident that the true value is between 95 and 105. Similarly, you can be 95 percent confident that the true value is between 90 and 110, and you can be nearly certain (99.7 percent confident) that the true value is between 85 and 115. To create confidence intervals with other percentages, you can look up critical values in Z-tables, which are widely available in statistical textbooks and on the Internet.\nIt is very difficult to verify that the data follows a multivariate normal distribution, and in practice, typically only univariate normality is verified. You can investigate univariate normality with the histogram chart.\nIf your data does not meet the assumptions for the 68-95-99.7 rule, or you are unsure whether your data meets the assumptions, a more conservative confidence interval can be created based on Chebyshev's inequality. This inequality states that for any distribution that has a finite mean and variance, at least (1-1/k2)·100 percent of the true values will fall within k standard errors of the predicted value, where k>1. Setting k=2, this inequality states that at least 75 percent of the true values will fall within two standard errors of the predicted value. Similarly with k=3, at least 88.9 percent of the true values will fall within three standard errors of the predicted value. Other values of k can be used to create intervals with different percentages.\nHow to interpret standard errors\nStandard error values should be interpreted while keeping in mind the values and range of the input data. For example, if the input data values are all between 10,000 and 12,000, a standard error value of 100 would likely indicate high precision in the predictions because the standard error is much smaller than the values and the range of the input data. However, if the data values are between 50 and 200, the same standard error of 100 would indicate low precision because the variability of the predictions is as large as the values and range of the input data.\nProbability maps are generally used when there is some critical value of interest, such as a national standard level of a pollutant. This critical value is called a threshold, and the output map will display the probability that this threshold value is exceeded or not exceeded. These maps are useful for seeing which areas are most or least likely to exceed or not exceed this critical threshold.\nQuantile maps display a specified quantile of the prediction distribution at each location. Quantile maps are generally used when preparing for worst- or best-case scenarios. For example, instead of creating a map with predicted values, you can create a map of the 95th quantiles of the predicted values. In this case, only 5 percent of the true values will exceed the value of the quantile surface. Similarly, if you create a 10th quantile map, only 10 percent of the true values will be less than the value of the quantile surface.\nStandard errors of indicators surface\nAn indicator variable is a binary variable that only takes the values 0 and 1. Indicator, probability, and disjunctive kriging all compute probability maps by reclassifying the input data to 0 or 1 based on a threshold value; values less than the threshold are reclassified to 0, and values greater than the threshold are reclassified to 1. After interpolating the indicator variable, the prediction map calculates the expected value of the indicator variable, and this expected value can be interpreted as the probability that the indicator variable equals one (in other words, that the threshold value is exceeded). Thus, the standard errors of indicators output map is a surface of the standard errors of the expected value of the indicator variable; in other words, it is the standard error of the probability that the threshold value is exceeded.\nBecause indicator variables cannot be normally distributed, you cannot use the 68-95-99.7 rule with indicator variables. To create confidence intervals for the probability that a threshold is exceeded, Chebyshev's inequality can be used.\nCondition number surface\nThe condition number surface is an optional output for local polynomial interpolation, and the surface is used to determine the stability of the predicted value at each prediction location. Condition numbers are difficult to interpret literally, but the larger the condition number, the larger the instability of the predictions. In this case, stability means the amount that the predicted value will change for a small change in the input data or small changes in the interpolation parameters. The rule of thumb for condition numbers in local polynomial interpolation is that for first-order polynomials, condition numbers should not exceed 10. For second-order polynomials, condition numbers should not exceed 100, and for third-order polynomials, the condition number should not exceed 1,000. Polynomial orders higher than three are generally not recommended.\nWhich output surface types are available for each interpolation method?\nIn the following table, the symbol indicates the available output surface types for each interpolation method.\n|Interpolation method||Predictions||Prediction standard errors||Quantile maps||Probability maps||Standard errors of indicators||Condition Number|\nEBK Regression Prediction\nEmpirical Bayesian kriging\nEmpirical Bayesian kriging 3D\nDiffusion interpolation with barriers\nGlobal polynomial interpolation\nKernel interpolation with barriers\nLocal polynomial interpolation\nRadial basis functions\n1 Requires assumption of multivariate normal distribution.\n2 Requires assumption of pairwise bivariate normality.\n3 Order of polynomial must be set to 1.\n4 A spatial condition number threshold must be used.\n5 Output must be created with GA Layer to Rasters.","Maps and spatial information technologies (Geographical Information Systems) in health and environment decision-making\nA map is primarily a means of display; it cannot predict the patterns of distribution or relationships between resources. In Figure 1, for example, the map does not infer a causal relationship, it merely points out that there are some spatial coincidences that are worth exploring, to see if a causal relationship exists. Likewise, to show how changes in one resource may impact distribution of another resource, the relationship must be known and put into the model creating the map.\nMost maps, unless they use data that are recorded in real time or near-real time (see Figure 5), represent only a snapshot of the situation at a particular time in history. As the environment is extremely dynamic, and conditions (many of which impact on health) are constantly changing, maps can quickly become outdated. Updating maps can be expensive in terms of the time required to make the maps and the cost of the information inputs required. In cases where current information is required (for example, monitoring of pollution dispersal from accidents or leaks), obtaining spatial information may be difficult or costly.\nThe Centre for International Earth Science Information Network (CIESIN) has used satellite-derived data to compile an Ultraviolet Index (UVI) and animated the maps to show the year to date. This can be used to issue health warnings to residents and travellers on a daily basis.\nAnother limitation of spatially-referenced environmental information is that access is often limited. For example, data may be available for only a portion of the required area, or for the whole area but taken from two or more different sampling exercises which may have used different sampling methodologies, scales, or accuracy levels.\nConnected to this are costs involved in generating maps, and in printing, disseminating, and updating them. This requires specialized hardware and software, trained personnel, and often expensive and time-consuming means of acquiring, checking, interpreting, and inputting information.\nFurthermore, the technology is rapidly advancing, and thus new applications and training courses are required on an almost annual basis. It is difficult for any non-commercial enterprise to keep up with these costs, but those in developing countries are most affected. The obvious result is that there are frequently data gaps or inaccuracies.\nFinally, not all people can readily relate to information in a two-dimensional spatial format, especially if the map is of an unfamiliar area or is presented in an unusual projection. Furthermore, different cultures place different importance or meaning on symbols and colours. For example, western cultures may use the colour red to symbolize danger or an area where conditions are bad, but in China this colour would symbolize luck or a favourable area.\nIn summary, maps are useful communication tools if they have been developed according to the best available information (about both the environmental conditions and the targeted users). However, they should be used together with – not in lieu of – other information, such as documents, discussions, and models."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"spanish_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:34f16e12-e381-4f66-a264-b9554886e6c6>","<urn:uuid:88c436f7-8ecb-433c-bb85-d88ab3152d1c>"],"error":null}

{"question":"¿Cuál es la relación entre la lateralidad de una amputación con hemiplejia y los resultados psicológicos en pacientes mayores, y cómo afecta esto a su calidad de vida?","answer":"The laterality of amputation with hemiplegia significantly impacts functional outcomes, with ipsilateral presentations (same side) showing better results than contralateral ones. Studies show that 56-95% of cases occur on the same side, and patients with ipsilateral comorbidities demonstrate better ambulatory function and daily living activities. For instance, patients with ipsilateral presentation had 17% higher Barthel Index scores and 50% higher Locomotor Capabilities Index scores compared to those with contralateral presentation. Regarding psychological aspects, older individuals who experienced amputation after age 50 show significantly more concern with body image and lower self-esteem compared to those who had amputations earlier in life. These psychological factors, combined with the physical challenges, affect their overall quality of life, highlighting the need for rehabilitation efforts that address both physical and psychosocial health domains.","context":["When Lightning Strikes Twice: Comorbid Amputation and Hemiplegia\nDecember 2013 Issue\nIn the introduction to their recent systematic review of patients with both hemiplegia and lower-limb amputation, Hebert et al. identify the shared risk factors between the two events.1 The population of individuals with lower-limb amputations is largely characterized by older adults with diabetes and peripheral neuropathy. The underlying risk factors for amputation, including high cholesterol, high blood pressure, poorly controlled diabetes, and smoking, are also common risk factors for other vascular diseases, such as cardiac disease, peripheral neuropathy, and cerebrovascular disease. As a common manifestation of a cerebrovascular accident (CVA), hemiplegia is strongly associated with these same risk factors. While either event may precede the other, their shared risk factors create the potential for the comorbid existence of lower-limb amputation and hemiplegia.\nGiven that both events can be quite devastating to an individual's functional abilities, their comorbid existence would appear to present a substantial rehabilitative challenge. This article investigates the prevalence of hemiplegia with lower-limb amputation, its effect on prosthetic outcomes, and any predictive characteristics that might be used to moderate goals and expectations during rehabilitation.\nThe prevalence for this comorbid presentation has been cited at between 8.5 and 18 percent (Table 1). Interestingly, the highest prevalence rate was identified in the largest study cohort in a recent paper investigating the prognosis of U.S. veterans with some sort of preexisting neurological disorder and subsequent lower-limb amputation.2 Extracting their data from the Veterans Health Administration databases, Prvu-Bettger et al. identified 4,720 veterans who underwent transtibial, transfemoral, or hip disarticulation amputation between 2002 and 2004. They then extracted the International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 codes from their outpatient files three months prior to the hospital admission associated with their lower-limb amputation. Diagnoses were then divided into either etiologies or comorbidities. The former represents those likely to have directly contributed to the amputation, such as congenital deformity, chronic osteomyelitis, type I and II diabetes mellitus, peripheral circulation problems, and skin breakdown. Comorbidities were those diagnoses perceived as less likely to be related to lower-limb amputation. These were then broken down into neurological and non-neurological factors such as cancer, congestive heart failure, and hypertension. This first classification was the focus of the research paper and included such categories as stroke or hemiparesis, cerebral degenerative disease (such as Alzheimer's disease), movement disorders (such as Parkinson's disease), spinal cord injury (SCI) or paralysis, and peripheral nervous system disorders (such as peripheral neuropathy).\nForty-three percent of the study cohort were found to have at least one comorbid neurological diagnosis. Peripheral nervous system disorders were the most common, identified in 20 percent of the total cohort, followed closely by stroke or hemiplegia, occurring in 18 percent of the total cohort. The prevalence rates of the other neurologic comorbidities were much lower, including SCI/paralysis at 4 percent, and both cerebral degenerative disease and movement disorders at 2 percent.2 While peripheral nervous system disorders had the highest prevalence, they also had the second lowest hazard ratio of the neurological comorbidities, meaning these subjects generally had higher one-year survival rates. By contrast, the hazard ratio associated with stroke and hemiplegia was one of the highest, with a 30 percent mortality rate one-year post lower-limb amputation.2\nIn addition to prevalence, several studies have reported observations on the demographics of the laterality of the comorbidities, that is, whether the hemiplegia and amputation occurred on the same side and the sequence in which the two occurred. With respect to laterality, Herbert et al.'s systematic review observes that amputation and hemiplegia occur most often in the same leg, with a frequency ranging from 56-95 percent (Table 2).1 Of the seven studies reporting on laterality, only one reported a majority of cases in which the lower-limb amputation was contralateral to the hemiplegia.\nThe laterality of these comorbidities appears to be important because the four studies from Table 2 that examined the effects of laterality on ambulatory function found improved functional abilities among those with ipsilateral comorbidities compared to those with contralateral comorbidities. For example, in their review of the 23 patients with comorbid hemiplegia and lower-limb amputation seen between 1984-1994 at the rehabilitation department in which they worked, Chiu et al. observed that eight of the 16 patients with ipsilateral comorbidities returned to community ambulation.3 By contrast, only two of the seven patients (29 percent) with contralateral comorbidities reached this level of function.3 The apparent impact of contralateral comorbidities on the number of comorbid subjects able to return to community ambulation was similar to the apparent disadvantages experienced with a transfemoral amputation (25 percent), severe hemiplegia (27 percent), and being 60 years old or older (33 percent).3\nIn a similar study, Brunelli et al. reviewed the charts of the 56 patients with both hemiplegia and transfemoral amputation seen for inpatient service, over a five year period, at the hospital in which they worked.4 These subjects' ability to accomplish their activities of daily living and their ambulatory skills were assessed using the Barthel Index (BI) and Locomotor Capabilities Index (LCI) respectively. Upon discharge, the BI scores of the patients with ipsilateral comorbidities were 17 percent higher than they were for the patients with contralateral comorbidities. Similarly, LCI scores for those with ipsilateral comorbidities (18/42) were 50 percent higher than the LCI scores seen among those with contralateral comorbidities (12/42).4\nThe data on sequencing was less consistent. Three of the six studies reporting upon this demographic observed that hemiplegia preceded lower-limb amputation the majority of the time. Two additional studies found a balanced likelihood of either comorbidity preceding the other. A final study reported lower-limb amputation occurring first in the majority of their subjects. Therefore, no consistent sequencing trends have been observed (Table 3).1\nAt this time there is little data to suggest that the sequencing of the comorbidities matters. In their review, Chiu et al. observed a greater likelihood of returning to community ambulation among subjects whose lower-limb amputation preceded hemiplegia (67 percent) compared to those whose hemiplegia preceded lower-limb amputation (33 percent). However, these trends must be viewed cautiously as the former group only consisted of six subjects.3 By contrast, Brunelli et al. failed to observe any substantive differences in either BI or LCI scores between the amputation-first (n=26) and hemiplegia-first (n=19) cohorts.4\nWhile the sequencing of the two comorbidities does not appear to predict function, there are several indications suggesting improved outcomes when the two comorbidities occur sequentially rather than simultaneously. Citing observations from some of the older trials on these populations, Herbert et al. summarize:\n- \"A longer time period between each subsequent disability may predict better outcomes.\"\n- \"Amputees who had been fitted with their prosthesis prior to having a stroke had better ambulatory function.\"\n- \"Patients who were ambulating prior to the second disability were more likely to achieve independent mobility than those who failed to ambulate after the first disability.\"\nOther Predictive Factors\nIn addition to laterality, there were several other presentation characteristics that appeared to influence rehabilitation outcomes. Four separate studies have observed improved outcomes among individuals with transtibial amputations and hemiplegia compared to their peers with transfemoral amputations.1 For example, Chiu et al. reported that while 53 percent of the 15 subjects with transtibial amputation regained community ambulation, only 25 percent of their peers with transfemoral amputation regained similar mobility.3\nAdditionally, several studies observed that patients with less severe hemiplegia also experienced greater gains in their rehabilitation than those with more severe hemiplegia.1 From the Chiu et al. study, 58 percent of the 12 subjects with mild hemiplegia regained community ambulation compared to only 27 percent of the 11 subjects with more severe hemiplegia (Table 4).3 Similarly, among their cohort of subjects with transfemoral amputation, the average discharge BI scores of patients with mild hemiparesis was 26 percent higher than those with moderate hemiparesis. Similarly, the average LCI scores for those with mild hemiparesis (17/42) were higher than for those with more severe hemiplegia (13/42).4\nThere have also been preliminary indications that mental status and age may act as predictive factors. Within their cohort, Chiu et al. divided their subjects into two groups according to mental status. Those with an \"intact\" mental status were defined as \"alert with normal judgment, orientation, memory, abstract thinking, and calculation with the ability to comprehend and learn.\" Subjects with \"impaired\" mental status were described as those who \"showed decreased alertness, disorientation, or decreased ability of learning.\" Of the five subjects with impaired mental status, none achieved community ambulation, and only one was capable of indoor ambulation. The remaining subjects were classified as nonambulators. By contrast, 56 percent of the 18 subjects with intact mental status were capable of community ambulation, and with an additional 22 percent were capable of indoor ambulation.3\nThe effect of age as a predictor of functional outcomes was less readily apparent. Chiu et al. observed that six of the eight subjects classified as nonambulators were over the age of 65.3 Of their 13 older subjects, only four obtained community ambulation.3 However, while Brunelli et al. reported a 10 percent increase in the average discharge BI score of subjects younger than 65, there was no significant difference in the average LCI scores of the two cohorts.4\nAny discussion about the likelihood of these comorbid patients returning to some level of functional ambulation must begin with an appreciation of the underlying sampling bias. The majority of the studies on the topic are derived from the data sets of inpatient rehabilitation departments, implying that a medical professional examined each of the included individuals and determined that they had a possibility of some return to function. There was certainly another subset of patients with amputation and comorbid hemiplegia whose rehabilitation potential was so poor that they would not have been referred to an inpatient rehabilitation setting.\nIn summarizing the data on the likelihood of patients being successfully fit with a prosthesis, Herbert et al. clarified that most studies did not directly report upon this metric. Instead, it was often derived by considering the number of patients with amputation and hemiplegia reported in the baselines of each study compared to the total number of patients who were reported to have reached an ambulatory level.1 Based on this analysis, the authors observed that five of the seven studies for which fit rate could be inferred had a rate greater than 58 percent.1\nFor those with amputation and comorbid hemiplegia who were successfully fit with a prosthesis, the ambulatory outcomes were generally quite good. Nonambulatory rates were generally reported at about 20-30 percent with the remainder of the subjects attaining either indoor or community ambulation. This allowed for the following evidence statement: \"[O]nce individuals with hemiplegia and lower-limb amputation are selected for prosthetic rehabilitation, the fit rates and potential for achieving some level of functional ambulation are good, with most studies showing greater than a 58 percent success rate.\"1\nBecause of the shared risk factors involved, there is a surprisingly high prevalence of patients who experience both hemiplegia and lower-limb amputation. Ipsilateral presentations of these comorbidities are described more frequently than contralateral presentations. This is fortunate, as patients with ipsilateral presentations appear to have improved outcomes. There does not appear to be a dominant sequence of the two events among individuals with both conditions. However, outcomes are improved when the events occur sequentially and allow subjects to experience some level of rehabilitation with one event prior to experiencing the other. Advanced age and having a transfemoral amputation, moderate to severe hemiplegia, and impaired mental status are all predictive of worse ambulatory abilities. However, most comorbid patients with a lower-limb amputation and hemiplegia who are referred for rehabilitation appear to benefit from prosthetic rehabilitation.\nPhil Stevens, MEd, CPO, FAAOP, is in clinical practice with Hanger Clinic, Salt Lake City, Utah.

Although amputation may be considered a life‐saving measure, individuals who incur amputation often experience negative long‐term psychological and psychosocial effects, which may prohibit them from re‐integrating into society and living normal lives. Numerous underlying demographic factors, such as level of amputation, time since amputation and co‐morbid conditions have been associated with psychological adjustments of lower limb amputees. The purpose of this study was to compare the psychosocial constructs of body image and self‐esteem in relation to reported health performance quality of life in older individuals who lost a limb early in life versus those who lost a limb later in life. Number of Subjects: The participants were recruited from a private practice prosthetic clinic. Subjects included in the data analysis were over the age of 50, had a single lower limb amputation, and used a prosthesis. Eleven subjects who experienced a lower limb amputation before the age of 25 were compared to a group of 35 participants who experienced a lower limb amputation after the age of 50. Materials/Methods: A series of questionnaires, including the Amputee Image Body Scale (ABIS), Rosenberg's Self‐Esteem Scale (RSES), Geriatric Depression Scale‐short form (GDS), Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), and Medical Outcomes Survey‐Short Form 36 (SF‐36) were distributed to an accessible population of people with amputation. Results: Individuals who experienced a lower limb amputation before the age of 25 had significantly less concern with body image and higher self‐esteem than those who experienced an amputation after the age of 50. When gender, age, level of amputation, time since amputation, and number of co‐morbid conditions were controlled for in data analyses, significant differences remained between the under‐25 group and the over‐50 group for body image and self‐esteem. No significant differences were found between groups for reported health performance quality of life. Conclusions: Whether a lower limb amputation occurs in early or late life, apparent differences exist in quality of life between older persons with amputation and age‐adjusted healthy norms. Additionally, differences exist in persons across all age groups for body image and self‐esteem. Clinical Relevance: Rehabilitation efforts must therefore continue to address all aspects of the physical and psychosocial domains of health if successful outcomes for older adults with amputation are to be achieved.\n© 2005 Academy of Geriatric Physical Therapy, APTA\nColleague's E-mail is Invalid\nYour Name: (optional)\nSeparate multiple e-mails with a (;).\nThought you might appreciate this item(s) I saw at Journal of Geriatric Physical Therapy.\nSend a copy to your email\nYour message has been successfully sent to your colleague.\nSome error has occurred while processing your request.

{"question":"Can u explain pls what are the main differences between full-duplex and half-duplex communication in hospitals disaster response?","answer":"Full-duplex and half-duplex communications serve different purposes in hospital disaster response situations. Full-duplex systems, like telephones, allow both parties to speak and be heard simultaneously using different frequencies. This is important for detailed communication between healthcare personnel, particularly when using teleradiology and computerized patient tracking systems. Half-duplex systems, like typical walkie-talkies, only allow communication in one direction at a time, where users must take turns speaking. During mass casualty incidents, half-duplex systems can be more practical for coordinating emergency responses and sending quick, actionable messages to multiple healthcare providers simultaneously. Both systems play crucial roles in hospital disaster response, with pagers and walkie-talkie systems being considered most reliable, while cell phone communications can become unreliable during disasters due to network congestion.","context":["The risk of terrorist attacks, nuclear-radiological hazards, power outages and epidemic-pandemic infections as well as earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis and fires are increasing worldwide. Mass casualty incidents, or MCIs, provide a constant reminder of why hospitals need a plan in place to be able to function optimally during and after a catastrophe.\nBetween 1983 and 2002, there were 36,110 bombing incidents, including the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The magnitude of the attack on the World Trade Center made it the worst human-made disaster in the history of the United States. As a result, America went to war and U.S. hospitals began an intense focus on emergency preparedness and disaster response.\nMCIs create a large number of casualties in a short period of time, placing tremendous strains on medical resources. In the 2004 Madrid commuter train bombing, there were more than 2,000 casualties, and the closest hospital received 272 patients in less than two hours. MCIs create particular challenges for any medical system that can quickly overwhelm local facilities.\nAlthough hospitals always have been expected to offer a safe environment during disasters, many may become unusable. Hospital leaders say that they have implemented planning and practice drills to help them handle the rush of patients. But there are still challenges and, sadly, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only 67 percent of American hospitals have plans in place for all of the above-mentioned hazards. Banks and airports may close in calamitous times, but the public expects hospitals to remain open — especially during disasters.\nLessons from War\nOne of the few good things about war is that it forces us to develop higher standards of trauma care. Hippocrates wrote, \"He who would become a surgeon should join an army and follow it.\" William Mayo, M.D, said, \"Medicine is the only victor in war.\" In contrast to most civilian physicians, the military is exquisitely trained to execute emergency plans for large-scale disasters. Using five hospital examples, I would like to point out the \"good,\" rather than the \"bad and ugly\" that has resulted from the recent conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\nEmergency response (Who's in charge?). The military's carefully choreographed medical system has advised civilian health care personnel in both pre-hospital and in-hospital acute care. Terrorism and MCIs at home must be viewed as predictable surprises. Therefore, a well-defined, planned hierarchy will facilitate patient triage and treatment.\nAll health care personnel should learn about the National Response Framework and the local incident command system to understand the larger picture at the national, state and regional levels. Whether it's an overturned school bus, a hotel fire or a terrorist attack, the on-scene incident commander manages all disasters locally. Do you know who that is at your facility? Your hospital also should have a dedicated command center with restricted access to a defined set of leaders. Do you know where that is and who they are?\nImproved hospital triage. Unfortunately, even without a disaster, emergency department crowding continues to be a major problem in the United States. Many hospitals now operate at full capacity and lack the ability to handle a sudden increase in volume associated with mass casualties. Less than half of hospitals have programs in place to accommodate the needs of children and persons with disabilities during a public health emergency.\nAlthough the initial triage of the wounded is funneled to the ED, the first bottleneck in patient diagnosis often occurs at the CT scanner. Thus, a busy radiology department needs to increase patient throughput (via abbreviated imaging protocols) and rapidly make room for newly arriving casualties. A second wave of casualties should be anticipated because patients may have been sent inappropriately to hospitals without trauma facilities.\nThe sudden increase in volume and the aftermath of an MCI is chaotic, disorganized and unpredictable, and care often is provided by sleep-deprived, stressed-out doctors. Patients may be physically unable to provide critical information about their medical history or simply too confused to provide it, so a working electronic health record system is critical for triage. Finally, the hospital isn't just a place for the injured; it is also a refuge for those fleeing the disaster, and thus becomes part of the disaster.\nMaintaining hospital function. War emphasizes the need to secure hospital facilities, erect a temporary field hospital, construct an interim hospital and have a plan for a replacement facility. Power, water and communication systems all can be damaged. Even with auxiliary power, some systems may go offline temporarily, or such services as CT scans may be suspended.\nThe American College of Emergency Physicians recommends that hospitals develop preparedness plans to ensure adequate inpatient surge capacity by such means as opening unused areas; doubling up inpatient rooms; and establishing alternate care areas in nonclinical space, in decommissioned ward space or inpatient hallways. Conversion of inpatient units to augment ICU capacity and canceling elective admissions and procedures is also an option.\nAs in war, preservation of the supply chain of nutrition, fluids and critical drugs is paramount. Drug shortages currently complicate health care in the United States, and this problem exists even in the absence of a large-scale disaster.\nImproved communication between health care personnel. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan were the first to use teleradiology, computerized patient tracking and a Web-based patient registry. Hospital information systems are more complex than ever, and reliance on information technology is firmly entrenched in organizational success. Backup and recovery mechanisms are essential. Hospitals should conduct a detailed evaluation of the emergency power system that includes all system-related components.\nIt is critical to distribute reliable, concise and actionable messages quickly to health care providers. Pagers, satellite and multichannel-access walkie-talkie systems are most reliable. Cell phone communication is less reliable, especially during a disaster, and unexpected heavy call volume may quickly jam cellular networks.\nUsing social media (e.g., texting, tweeting, YouTube) before, during and after disasters didn't exist a decade ago. But today, mobile apps can provide ED wait times as well as census data to gauge the strain of the health care system. GPS-linked mobile apps can divert patients to facilities with sufficient resources; and off-duty personnel can broadcast their professional background and willingness to help during emergencies.\nPractice makes perfect. The unpredictable nature of terrorism and MCIs makes preparation key. Nothing teaches disaster preparedness like experience. Physicians need to be familiar with the unique spectrum of injuries inflicted by blasts that fall outside their routine practice. Emergency response practice can uncover weaknesses in the system and fix it so it doesn't happen again. All departments should know their assigned roles in advance. Has your department performed practice drills? Hospital leaders should think two to three steps ahead and constantly look at all of the what-ifs. In a disaster situation, there is no time for what-ifs.\nEmergency responders play different roles in the rescue operation, but there is one commonality: the importance of communication, collaboration and action. Hospitals should strive to automate emergency plans and protocols, and perform exercises until staff members know how to respond reflexively.\nPublic health preparedness has improved by leaps and bounds since that fateful day in September 2001. While war has its horrendous side, it has always advanced medical care. And it has uncovered opportunities to go beyond the danger of an immediate situation, benefiting medicine during future disasters.\nAlisa Gean, M.D., is a professor of neuroradiology and adjunct professor of neurology and neurological surgery at the University of California at San Francisco and San Francisco General Hospital.

With cell phones now being able to connect you to the internet, share pictures, and access email (among many other things) it is not surprising that they are seen as a descendant of two-way radios. This could not be farther from the truth. It is no secret that cell phones have come a long way in recent years, but what is widely unknown are the many uses of two-way radios that cell phones just can’t do.\nThe History of Two-Way Radios\nTwo-way radios date back to the late 1800s. In 1885, Heinrich Hertz proved the existence of electromagnetic waves and that these waves could be sent and received. Shortly thereafter, Nikola Tesla used this theory and created the first radio. To learn more about Hertz, visit (this article). To learn more about Tesla and his part in two-way radio history, visit (this link). Two-way radios made their first appearance on ocean ships and airplanes. Before this, pilots often had to land their planes to deliver important messages, and ships were relegated to using Morse code and carrier pigeons. Within a few decades, two-way radios were implemented in police cars, and used by the military in WWII. Today two-way radios are used in numerous public and government functions. From firefighters to police officers, and construction workers to miners, two-way radios go where cell phones simply can’t.\nThree Modes of Communication\nWhen electromagnetic waves were first harnessed to serve as communication transmitters, they were sent in only one direction, which is referred to as simplex communication. Your car radio or home televisions are examples of this form of communication. Simplex communication is one-directional and often used in instances of emergency when a large population needs to receive information. Your television harnesses simplex communication to deliver you the news, and both your TV and radio will interrupt normal broadcasting to inform citizens of emergency situations. Today simplex communication is still used in daily life more than most people realize. Pagers, GPS services, baby monitors, garage door openers, video cameras, and printers all rely on simplex communication.\nWhile advancements in technology with radios and harnessing electromagnetic waves continued, two new systems evolved: half-duplex and full-duplex communication. Half-duplex communication is when radio waves can be transmitted and received by the same tool, but signals can only move in one direction at a time. Most walkie-talkies work in this fashion. A button is held down by the current transmitter, while the receiver simply hears the message. After the message is received, the receiver can then send a message back. In contrast, a full-duplex system of communication allows for both transmitter and receiver to send messages at the same time. Examples of this are today’s home and cellular telephones. While people are speaking to one another using telephones, both speakers can talk and be heard at the same time. Two-way radios can also be designed to work on full-duplex mode, where the transmitter relays their message on one frequency, and the receiver of that message can also relay a message at the same time using a different frequency. (Read More)\nMost people would follow the logic that when looking at the advancements in communication, full-duplex is better than half, and half is better than simple. In contrast, all three forms of communication have their own pros and cons. Simplex communication is used in technology that is all around us, and would have no added benefit if turned into half or full-duplex forms. Do we really need our garage door openers to transmit signals back to us? Or do we need to send radio signals to our GPS services? Most would say no. It would be a waste of time and money to create car radios that also send outgoing messages. On the other hand, our telephones would be of little value to us if we were only able to speak to our friend at the other end without them being able to respond. When we compare two-way radios to telephones, cell phones in particular, we see many advantages to using a two-way radio.\nEmergency Situations: Group and Instant Information\nWhen it comes to emergency personnel, one would be hard pressed to find individuals who believe that a cell phone would be of greater use to them than a two-way radio. There are two main reasons for this: group communication and instant messages. Picture a large house fire. Firefighters and other emergency workers arrive to the scene, already with their two-way radios set to the same channel. All messages sent out by each person are heard by every worker who is set to the designated frequency. No answering, no buttons to push, no stopping. In addition to all personnel being able to hear the same messages, they receive these messages instantly. While a paramedic is moving an injured person to a nearby ambulance, he hears on his radio that another person has been rescued and needs medical support. He can quickly prepare himself and his team for the next person, and do it within a matter of seconds. The lives of all workers, and the people they are trying to rescue, require immediate action and to the second information.\nIn addition to emergency personnel, every day citizens will find it difficult to use their cell phone during national emergencies. It has often been seen during these times that millions of people get on their phone trying to reach loved ones. Because of this massive deluge of callers, cell phone networks often do not work. Callers cannot get through, and messages are not sent or received.\nIn addition to ease of use, group and instant messaging and reliability in emergency situations, two-way radios are much more durable than today’s cell phones. As most of us know, a cell phone can be destroyed with one simple drop onto an asphalt or concrete surface. Two-way radios are much sturdier and able to withstand much more abuse than any cell phone on the market. In tough work environments, a cell phone might last a matter of months, whereas a two-way radio can withstand the conditions and last for years.\nEven though most of us are used to having excellent cell phone coverage, there are many locations around the world where cell phone towers are absent. When in remote locations, two-way radios are far superior. Two-way radios do not need any towers to send signals. The radio waves are simply transmitted from radio to radio. Examples of these areas include remote forests, underground construction sites, and open ocean.\nToday, two-way radio providers are creating larger and larger areas in which radios are able to transmit to one another. A common problem with two-way radios is that their range can be just a few miles. For many companies, and during emergency situations, this short distance is detrimental to operations. Towers and tall buildings equipped with radio transmission equipment are making it possible to send messages via two-way radios that are up to 300 miles away. Using this equipment, messages are received in less than one second, just as if the two-way radios were only feet apart. (Learn More)\nOverall two-way radios and cell phones are wonderful pieces of technology that in and of themselves serve very different purposes. Each has had advancements that further their uses, and in many ways are on separate tracks. Cell phones are great for having conversations, playing games or browsing the web. Two-way radios are a means of instant communication in emergency situations, in remote locations and when cell phone towers are overwhelmed.
