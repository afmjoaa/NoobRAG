{"question":"Could you explain how Aldabra's unique marine research initiatives have evolved, and what factors contribute to its coral reefs' exceptional recovery from bleaching events?","answer":"Aldabra has become a significant site for marine research through various initiatives, including studies of marine predator communities down to 500m depth and the implementation of the first zonation strategy in Seychelles, dividing near-shore marine areas into tourism, food security, and conservation zones. Regarding coral reef recovery, research has shown that Aldabra's lagoon corals demonstrated remarkable resilience after the 2015-2016 bleaching event, recovering their pre-bleaching coral cover and community composition within just four years. This enhanced recovery is attributed to the high daily temperature fluctuations inside the lagoon, which appear to increase the corals' tolerance to heat stress. The atoll's limited direct human impact makes it an ideal benchmark for studying reef resilience globally.","context":["SeyCCAT and Nekton co-financed five research projects led by different individuals in Seychelles. In total, 7 Seychellois directly benefited from this grant. Read more about the research projects undertaken on the Nekton Mission in Seychelles, here. All updates are derived from reports of the researchers.\nSeychelles Ocean Symposium – 9th to 12th November 2020\nSeyCCAT, Nekton and other Seychelles based partners came together in November 2020 to bring together an online symposium. The symposium saw the participation of more than 10 local and international partners over a four-day period with more than 30 presentations highlighting the work being conducted in the Seychelles. SeyCCAT grantees as well as the Seychelles-Nekton First Descent Expedition in 2019. The presentations can be accessed here.\nThe symposium attracted more than 300 attendees over the course of the week.\nResearcher: Dr Jeanne Mortimer\nResearch question: What species of seagrass and marine algae occur in the outer islands of Seychelles? How are the species distributed from island to island? What is the relationship between water depth and patterns of distribution and species composition? What is the maximum depth in which they can survive?\nJeanne, has so far been involved in shallow water collection from seagrass habitats in Poivre, St Joseph atoll, and Desroches Island (two sites). This involved collecting, curating and archiving sample from each site. Observer reports and photos taken by the submersibles and the ROVs indicated that large amounts of dead seagrass were raining onto the deep sea floor from above—at every depth surveyed during the expedition.\nRead the findings and presentations of Dr Jeanne A. Mortimer here\nResearcher: Jennifer Appoo – the Science and Projects Coordinator at the Seychelles Islands Foundation (SIF).\nResearch question: Investigating the marine predator community around Aldabra to assess connectivity between shallow and deep-sea ecosystems and the effectiveness of the Aldabra marine zonation strategy. This will combine data on top marine predators from the Seychelles Islands Foundation with the data collected from the Nekton Expedition and will provide a complete picture of the marine predator community around Aldabra down to 500m.\nAldabra’s near-shore marine area is divided into three management zones namely tourism zones, food security zones and conservation zones. This type of zonation strategy within a marine protected area is the first in Seychelles. The research will investigate the abundance, diversity and distribution of marine predators around Aldabra from the shallow to the deep sea and the effectiveness of the zoning plan on these top predators. The results will provide valuable lessons for sustainable fisheries management for Aldabra and this model example can be replicated in other locations in the country through the Marine Spatial Planning process.\nFinal Scientific Report: Aldabra marine predator report_JAppoo_final\nResearchers: Stephanie Marie, Clara Belmont, Andrew Souffe and Nathalie Bodin.\nResearch Topic: Variability in trophic signatures of zooplankton and food web dynamics within Seychelles waters\nSeychelles depends highly on fish, as their main source of protein, and planktons (small microorganisms in the water) happen to play a vital role in fish diet. However, the effect of climate change threatens the plankton communities. In order to ensure good fish quality for consumption the Seychelles Fishing Authority (SFA) needs to observe how climate change is having an effect on the marine ecosystem and in turn, influence the management plan for sustainable fisheries.\nWhilst Stephanie has not been able to travel, Nuria Rico Seijo, the lab manager of the Nekton foundation based in Oxford has been assisting the project. She has begun sifting through every sample to find out what type of microscopic animals make up each sample, by location and by night and day.\nPreliminary results: The preliminary results show that copepods (which are part of the Phylum Arthropoda) occur in the highest abundance in all the samples investigated so far (Figure 1 and 2). You can learn more about the world of zooplankton and the preliminary results here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UtSXQXULZ4M. The results will be used by Stephanie to examine the within-taxa spatial variation in zooplankton isotopic, fatty acid signatures and to link it to environment conditions.\nOutput: Zooplankton sampling protocol using Neuston Net.\nCOVID-19 delays: Stephanie has faced many delays with her project which has occurred due to the travel restrictions imposed to limit the spread of Covid-19 worldwide.\nIchthyoplankton surveys give valuable information as to the spawning dynamics of a host of different species. With the advancement of genetics methods, scientists are now able to investigate both larvae as well as eggs, with some scientists arguing that fish eggs provide a more precise method to evaluate the spawning habits of fish populations because eggs are easier to track as, unlike larvae they do not swim (Richardson et al. 2009).\nResearcher: Sheena Talma from the Ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate Change.\nResearch topic: Spatio-temporal abundance and distribution of ichthyoplankton with the Seychelles waters.\nThe Indian Ocean remains a region of scientific interest as little research has been conducted within its waters and only a handful have investigated zooplankton communities especially the occurrence of fish larvae and eggs throughout the water column. Sheena Talma’s project is focused on identifying fish eggs and larvae using genetic methodologies. Before sequencing the fish and eggs DNA, Sheena and the team have taken photos of the fish larvae so that they can also be identified morphologically (looking at its dominant features). Based on previous work done within the Western Indian Ocean, some species that Sheena’s team expects to find species like kingfish, triggerfish, surgeonfish, sauries and tuna.\nThe findings will inform the preliminary species occurrence and spatial distribution of fish larvae in the Seychelles EEZ.\nCOVID-19 delays: Sheena’s project has been put on hold until further notice due to the laboratories being closed in South Africa.\nResearcher: Damien Labiche, Assistant conservation officer from the Ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate Change.\nResearch Topic: Identification of deep-sea shark and rays\nSharks and rays play an important role in the ecosystem as apex predators. Through a highly collaborative process, our project aims to identify deep-sea sharks that may be collected on camera footage from ROV’s drop cameras and subs. The occurrence of species in the area will be key to be able to compare data sets with regional and international partners. This is an important undertaking as it will allow for preliminary data to be collected and possible shark species to be identified in the Seychelles, where previous records do not exist.\nCOVID-19 delays: The ministry responsible for the environment continues to support the work of Ashley Dias, Damien Labiche and their partners towards investigating the sharks and rays of the deep. They are currently identifying sharks and rays that have been seen on camera footage between 10 to 1000m. Due to Covid-19 flight restrictions, their planned shark-fin identification and shark and ray forum have had to be postponed until further notice.\nAfrica – Oxford Fellowships\nThe SeyCCAT-Nekton collaboration offered two Seychellois the opportunity to participate in the AFox Fellowship.

Reef-building corals in the tropics are colonial animals that are very sensitive to changing temperatures.\nthe coral mortality was not only substantially lower in Aldabra’s lagoon but that lagoonal reefs also recovered their pre-bleaching coral cover. (Imran Ahmad Bin Rayat Ahmad, Seychelles Islands Foundation) Photo License: All Rights Reserved\nThe chief executive of SIF, Frauke Fleischer-Dogley, said, “It is my firm belief that this specific research on Aldabra’s coral reefs is of crucial value for not only the atoll and Seychelles, but at a global level.”\nShe added that coral reefs are hugely impacted by climate change and only by understanding what makes the reefs resilient that “we can adapt our management practices and policies fully.”\nAldabra’s reefs serve as a benchmark since direct human impacts are extremely limited and therefore recovery rates are expected to be at their ‘best’ and can be used to calibrate the resilience and recovery of other reefs around the world.\nWith severe bleaching events expected to occur annually on 90 percent of the world’s coral reefs by 2055, such research and long-term commitment to monitoring these valuable ecosystems are critical.\nAldabra – one of the world’s largest atolls – is a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Seychelles, an archipelago in the western Indian Ocean.

Although the use of both runways simultaneously may serve to increase flight efficiency, shorter approach tracks and taxi routes for example, there are significant inherent risks associated with simultaneous operation of intersecting runways; strict procedures must be in place to prevent a runway incursion.\nIn terms of total throughput, using just one runway in mixed mode will in most cases provide a similar capacity to that which is possible with both runways operating, but with a substantially reduced potential for runway incursion incidents.\nAccidents and Incidents\n- A319 / B737, Zurich Switzerland, 2002 (On 23 November 2002, an A319, landing on Rwy16 at Zurich Switzerland, narrowly missed collision with a B737-600 cleared for take off on an intersecting runway.)\n- A320 / F50, Adelaide Australia, 2016 (On 17 August 2016, a Fokker F50 crossed an active runway at Adelaide ahead of an A320 which was about to land after both its pilots and the controller involved had made assumptions about the content of radio transmissions they were aware they had not fully heard. The Investigation found that the A320 crew had responded promptly to the potential conflict by initiating a low go around over the other aircraft and noted that stop bars were not installed at Adelaide. In addition, aircraft taxiing across active runways were not required to obtain their crossing clearances on the runway control frequency.)\n- AT43/A346, Zurich Switzerland, 2010 (On 18 June 2010, an ATR 42 began a daylight take off on runway 28 at Zurich without ATC clearance at the same time as an A340 began take off from intersecting runway 16 with an ATC clearance. ATC were unaware of this until alerted to the situation by the crew of another aircraft which was waiting to take off from runway 28, after which the ATR 42 was immediately instructed to stop and did so prior to the runway intersection whilst the A340 continued departure on runway 16 .)\n- B190 / BE9L, Quincy IL USA, 1996 (On 19 November 1996, a Beech 1900C which had just landed and a Beech King Air A90 which was taking off collided at the intersection of two runways at the non-Towered Quincy Municipal Airport. Both aircraft were destroyed by impact forces and fire and all occupants of both aircraft were killed. The Investigation found that the King Air pilots had failed to monitor the CTAF or properly scan visually for traffic. The loss of life of the Beech 1900 occupants, who had probably survived the impact, was attributed largely to inability to open the main door of the aircraft.)\n- B463 / PA38 Birmingham UK, 1999 (On 28 April 1999, a BAe 146-300 departing Birmingham began its daylight take off from Runway 33 without ATC clearance just prior to the touchdown of a PA38 on the intersecting runway 06.

{"question":"When comparing the safety and testing procedures between voltage transformers and current transformers, what are the essential differences in their inspection and calibration requirements, and how does this affect their maintenance approach?","answer":"Voltage transformers and current transformers have distinct safety and testing requirements. For voltage transformers, initial visual checks are crucial - examining ratings on the attached plate, checking for loose/damaged parts, and inspecting for oil leakage in lubricated transformers. Accuracy testing involves checking resistance units, proper grounding, and calibration for efficient energy transfer. Due to safety concerns with high voltage equipment, testing should be done by qualified experts with proper tools and procedures. For current transformers (CTs), safety is addressed through design - they provide replica currents scaled to manageable levels and bring their replicas to safe ground potential reference. CT testing focuses on performance characteristics including turns ratio, ratio error, saturation voltage, phase angle error, and rated secondary circuit load. Both types require professional expertise for maintenance, but CTs have additional considerations regarding burden and configuration options, while maintaining a mandatory safety ground connection to prevent windings from reaching primary voltage levels.","context":["When it comes to high voltage equipment, safety is always an issue. Whether you are using transformers of a small kind in the workplace, or we are talking about larger devices for power supply, there is always a danger where electricity is concerned. Also, transformers need to be as efficient as possible; there will always be some loss of energy between points, but keeping that to a minimum is beneficial.\nTesting voltage transformers is not something that should be done by the layman. Anyone who gets involved with machinery or devices such as this should have a clear understanding of what is involved, how things work, and why it is important to test such transformers on a regular basis. After all, performance is an issue where energy loss is concerned, and transformers are a vital part of any circuit.\nThe Testing Procedure\nSo, where do you start when it comes to testing a voltage transformer? To begin with, there are certain visual checks that you should make before you move on to anything more complex. For example, you need to check all the ratings – they will be there on a plate attached to the transformer – to make sure they are the same as the information you are given. You can also do a visual check to make sure everything is in place, and nothing is obviously loose or damaged.\nLeakage is a problem with some transformers that use an oil lubricant; this will be easy to see and should be noted for attention. Remember, do not attempt a repair of a voltage transformer unless you are properly qualified and experienced, and have the right tools. Once you have completed a visual check, to make sure all the connections are tight, everything is where its should be, and nothing looks out of place, you need to move on to the next phase, which is checking the actual operation of the transformer.\nTest and Calibration\nOne of the problems with testing voltage transformers is that of accuracy. You need to check that the transformer is working correctly and providing the most accurate transfer of energy required. This involves checking the resistance units, making sure the grounding is correct, and being able to understand where things are not as they should be. This is why we would suggest it is best to bring in an expert who has the knowledge, experience and qualifications to correctly test and calibrate the voltage transformer in question, like those at Powerpoint Engineering.\nWhen it comes to important and potentially dangerous equipment, among which the voltage transformer can be classed, it is essential that everything is absolutely right. This is true not just of the way the equipment is put together, but also how accurate it is. Calibration is a major part of efficiency, in both measurement and output terms, and a correctly maintained, calibrated and operational voltage transformer will provide much better results than one that is not fine-tuned.\nIt is best to leave the maintenance, testing and calibration of items such as this to the experts for various reasons. Firstly, they have the knowledge and experience to know what they are looking at, where the problems may be, and how to deal with them in the best possible way. Secondly, they have in place procedures that are designed to make sure things are as safe as possible at every juncture.\nIf you are in charge of voltage transformers and need to find people to test and calibrate them, we recommend you contact the experts, and it will make your life a lot easier and save you money in the long run.","HV electrical measurements //\nElectrical measurements on a high-voltage transmission and distribution systems cannot be made practically or safely with direct contact to the power carrying conductors. Instead, the voltages and currents must be brought down to a safe and usable level that can be input into measuring instruments.\nThis is the whole point task of an instrument transformers CTs and VTs.\nThey provide replica voltages and currents scaled to more manageable levels. They also bring their replicas to a safe ground potential reference. The most common output range 0 – 5.0 A for currents based on their nominal inputs. Other ranges are used as well.\nThe majority of these devices are iron core transformers.\nCurrent transformers (CTs) of all sizes and types find their way into substations to provide the current replicas for metering, controls, and protective relaying. Some will perform well for SA applications and some may be marginal.\nCT performance is characterized by:\n- Turns ratio,\n- Turns ratio error (ratio correction factor),\n- Saturation voltage,\n- Phase angle error, and\n- Rated secondary circuit load (burden).\nCTs are often installed around power equipment bushings, as shown in Figure 1 below:\nThey are the most common types found in medium voltage and high voltage equipment. Bushing CTs are toroidal, having a single primary turn (the power conductor), which passes through their center. The current transformation ratio results from the number of turns wound on the core to make up the primary and secondary.\nTheir ratio is the number of secondary turns divided by the number of primary turns. CT secondary windings are often tapped to provide multiple turns ratios. The core cross-sectional area, diameter, and magnetic properties determine the CT’s performance.\nAs the CT is operated over its nominal current ranges, its deviations from specified turns ratio are characterized by its ratio correction curve sometimes provided by the manufacturer. At low currents, the exciting current of the iron core causes ratio errors that are predominant until sufficient primary magnetic flux overcomes the effects of core magnetizing.\nThus, watt or var measurements made at very low load may be substantially in error both from ratio error and phase shift. Exciting current errors are a function of individual CT construction. They are generally higher for protection CTs than revenue metering CTs by design.\nRevenue metering CTs are designed with core cross sections chosen to minimize exciting current effects and their cores are allowed to saturate at fault currents. Protection CTs use larger cores as high current saturation must be avoided for the CT to faithfully reproduce high currents for fault sensing.\nThe exciting current of the larger core at low primary current is not considered important for protection but can be a problem for measuring low currents. Core size and magnetic properties determine the ability of CTs to develop voltage to drive secondary current through the circuit load impedance (burden).\nThis is an important consideration when adding SA IEDs or transducers to existing metering CT circuits, as added burden can affect accuracy. The added burden of SA devices is less likely to create metering problems with protection CTs at load levels, but could have undesirable effects on protective relaying at fault levels. In either case, CT burdens are an important consideration in the design.\nExperience with both protection and metering CTs wound on modern high silicon steel cores has shown, however, that both perform comparably once the operating current sufficiently exceeds the exciting current if secondary burden is kept low.\nCT secondary windings are generally uncommitted.\nThey can be connected in any number of configurations so long as they have a safety ground connection to prevent the windings from drifting toward the primary voltage. It is common practice to connect CTs in parallel so that their current contribution can be summed to produce a new current such as one representing a line current where the line has two circuit breaker connections such as in a ‘‘breaker-and-a-half ’’ configuration.\nHowever, new technology has developed, which makes it possible for an IED to compensate for CT performance limitations.\nThis technology allows the IED to ‘‘learn’’ the properties of the CT and correct for ratio and phase angle errors over the CT’s operating range. Thus, a CT designed to feed protection devices can be used to feed revenue measuring IEDs and meet the requirements of IEEE Standard C57.13.\nOccasions arise where it is necessary to obtain current from more than one source by summing currents with auxiliary CTs.\nThere are also occasions where auxiliary CTs are needed to change the overall ratio or shift phase relationships from a source from a wye to a delta or vice versa to suit a particular measuring scheme. These requirements can be met satisfactorily only if the auxiliaries used are adequate. If the core size is too small to drive the added circuit burden, the auxiliaries will introduce excessive ratio and phase angle errors that will degrade measurement accuracy.\nUsing auxiliary transformer must be approached with caution.\nResource: Automation and the Substation – James W.

{"question":"What happens when a condenser gets flooded with refrigerant, and how does this affect system efficiency?","answer":"When a condenser gets flooded with refrigerant, it stacks liquid refrigerant inside the condenser, effectively reducing its active condensing surface area. This makes the condenser smaller in terms of usable space, causing head pressure to rise. The flooding effect is similar to blocking the condenser with cardboard - it prevents proper heat rejection. Regarding efficiency, a flooded/blocked condenser leads to several issues: the condensing temperature and pressure rise significantly, causing higher compression ratios; the compressor's discharge temperature increases and draws more amperage; the subcooled liquid temperature rises, causing more flash gas at the metering device; and there is lower volumetric efficiency due to more re-expansion of discharge gas in the clearance space between the valve plate and piston face.","context":["with a headmaster does it throttle the refrigerant at a specific rate to keep proper head pressure or is it open/closed\nhttp://www.sporlan.com/SD-134.pdf Check this out it has the answer I think your looking for.\nThe HP valve throttles open on rise of inlet pressure.\nSo as the ambient air entering the condenser coil gets warmer, the valve opens more to allow more condenser flow, so then, as the ambient gets colder, the valve closes in order to flood the condenser.\nThis cold flooded liquid will now mix with the compressor discharge gas and maintain head pressure.\nA lot of guys get this mixed up and let it confuse them. It use to me too when I was starting in the trade. The one thing I might be able to help with someone understanding is the way I was taught.\nWhen you block a condenser with a peice of card board, what happens? The pressure rises, is that correct? Of course it would because now your not rejecting the heat correctly to the ambient. Pressure and temperature rise together.\nWell in the case of a head master, what we do is, we stack refrigerant inside the condenser. We reduce the capacity of the condenser by filling it partially with condensed liquid refrigerant. What ever part of the condenser is filled with condensed liquid refrigerant, is now rendered useless to condense any vapor. So in reality were using the refrigerant itself to block part of the condenser from being active by filling it with the liquid. were in effect making the condenser smaller.\nWhen we reduce the \"effective condensing surface area\" we now have less of a condenser, which causes the head pressure to Rise.\nAs it rises, the headmaster valve stands at the ready, to allow passage of refrigerant to the receiver at whatever pressure setting the headmaster is set for. A common setting for r22, Sporlan LAC4 is 180 PSI. So that means, as the condenser pressure rises to 180 and above, we allow more and more refrigerant to leave out of the condenser and to pass to receiver.\nNow think of the receiver. If I got 180 PSI, little by little being fed to it to allow passage to the receiver, I better have a lower pressure in my receiver for the refrigerant to flow from the condenser to receiver. If the receiver pressure was the same as the condenser, I'd never be able to flow out to receiver once my head pressure reached the setting of the headmaster. Generally, 20 PSI difference. So the receiver should be in the 160 PSI range.\nAs the ambient drops, this valve will modulate more and more to a position that stacks more refrigerant into the condenser to more and more elevate the head pressure to the headmaster setting.\nHow exactly does the Headmaster flood the condenser? Does i slightly close off the outlet of the condenser and cause the refrigerant to back up into the condenser? Also what does the discharge line do?\nwhere does refrigerant like to go? The Niorth Pole? haha j/k well sort of Refrigerant likes to go(migrate where it's coldest. as cold ambient air is forced over the condenser coil that was designed to operate in an enviroment with much higher ambient temperatures, where it's so cold the refrigerant condenses quicker, (and it is colder and the pressure is lower, look at P/T Chart)\nso a system with a headmaster has to have more refrigerant in the system(than an equivalant regular non \"winterized\" system) to compensate for the volume inside the condenser where the refrigerant wil be when it's cold and be able to keep a liquid level in the reciever over the bottom of the dip tube\nso for summer operation the temp is up and it takes more area for the refrigerant to condense so the condenser is mostly high pressure vapor and the reciever level is higher(still the same ount of refrigerant in the syseem so it's(liquid refrigerant) not in the condenser and the level in the reciever is higher. so along with the headmaster the sysem has to have enough space in the reciever to handle the amount of refrigerant in the summer\nwhere these syseems need more refrigerant for winter operation you can calculate the amount of refrigerant by looking at the size of the condenser, instructions for that are on the sporlan and alco head pressure control bullitens. when you get a new low ambient ready self contained condensing unit there will be a sheet in with it tellling you the \"condenser charge, basically for an example it would say something like after sight glass is full weighe in additional 5.5lbs of refrigerant (made up numbers)\nSig removed by mod. G-Rated site\nYour not reading the details close enough bro. The headmaster is regulating pressure based on the inlet pressure to it from the condenser. This means that, if a head master is set for 180 PSI, the headmaster will not allow refrigerant to pass by it from the condenser to the receiver. If it's being blocked from passing, then this is how it begins to stack and flood the condenser. The other passage in the valve, is also proportional and allows the receiver to be 20 PSI less, with discharge gas being fed to receiver by the valove throttling based on the outlet also.\nOriginally Posted by yotaman16\nOk i get how the head pressure is being raised by the condenser being partially blocked by the liquid refrigerant that is being stacked in it. The headmaster can close the flow from the condenser to the reciever off to flood and raise the pressure up to the setting when then the valve will modulate to keep the desired or set pressure.. Am i right there or did i still miss somthing.. ALso how does the high pressure gas from the discharge line keep the reciever at a 20 psi diffirential from the condenser?\nwhen the headmaster detects low head pressure, it allows discharge gas to bypass the condensor and go straight to the receiver. this increases pressure in the receiver which does two things.\n1. force liquid out of the receiver\n2. the increased pressure in the receiver is now higher than the condensor. this causes the refrigerant to back up in the condensor untill the condensing pressure is once again higher than the receiver pressure at which point the normal flow resumes.\nas long as the headmaster is applying discharge gas pressure to the receiver, the condensing pressure will be artificially increased. The amount of gas that bypasses the condensor is negligable. it is only enough to increase the pressure in the receiver to the desired condensing pressure. it does not mix with the liquid and flow to the metering device.\nand on the coldest day you'll get to top off the charge\nthe headmaster on some liebert's is set at 150. On very cold days if the system charge is a bit low( say 1 or 2 lbs.), the headmaster setting prevents enough gas from going to the evap--showing like a 15 psi suction. if everything is everything and you add a little gas, all of a sudden the suction will pop up to normal. then you get to plan on finding a leak and reweighing the total charge--preferably when it's not -6*.\nbut the headmaster was not seeing the 150psi or whatever that particular valve setting is...\nIt's great to be alive and pumping oxygen!\nwhat does 'flood the condensor' mean? i thought gas went to the condenser, or do you mean that it over condenses?","How a Dirty or Blocked Condenser Effects System Efficiency\nAs its name states, one of the main functions of the condenser is to condense the refrigerant sent to it from the compressor. However, the condenser also has other functions. Desuperheating and subcooling are other important functions of the condenser.\nIn summary, the three main functions of the condenser are:\nDesuperheatingThe first passes of the condenser desuperheat the discharge line gases. This prepares the high-pressure superheated vapors coming from the compressor’s discharge line for condensation, or the phase change from vapor to liquid. Remember, these superheated gases must lose all of their superheat before reaching the condensing temperature for a certain condensing pressure. Once the initial passes of the condenser have rejected enough superheat and the condensing temperature has been reached, these gases are referred to as saturated vapor. The refrigerant is then said to have reached the 100% saturated vapor point. (See Figure 1.)\nCondensationAs mentioned earlier, one of the main functions of the condenser is to condense the refrigerant vapor to liquid. Condensing is system dependent and usually takes place in the lower two-thirds of the condenser. Once the saturation or condensing temperature is reached in the condenser and the refrigerant gas has reached 100% saturated vapor, condensation can take place if more heat is removed.\nAs more heat is taken away from the 100% saturated vapor, it will force the vapor to become a liquid (or to condense). When condensing, the vapor will gradually phase change to liquid until 100% liquid is all that remains. (See Figure 1.)\nThis phase change, or change of state, is an example of a latent heat rejection process, as the heat removed is latent heat, not sensible heat.\nThis phase change will happen at one temperature even though heat is being removed. This one temperature is the saturation temperature corresponding to the saturation pressure in the condenser. This pressure can be measured anywhere on the high side of the refrigeration system as long as line and valve pressure drops and losses are negligible. Table 1 is a pressure/temperature chart of HFC-134a.\n(Note: Exceptions to this are near-azeotropic blends [ASHRAE 400 series blends] of refrigerants. With these blends, there can be a noticeable temperature glide or range of temperatures when the blend is phase changing.)\nSubcoolingThe last function of the condenser is to subcool the liquid refrigerant. Subcooling is defined as any sensible heat taken away from 100% saturated liquid. Technically, subcooling is defined as the difference between the measured liquid temperature and the liquid saturation temperature at a given pressure. Once the saturated vapor in the condenser has phase changed to saturated liquid, the 100% saturated liquid point has been reached.\nIf any more heat is removed, the liquid will go through a sensible heat-rejection process and lose temperature as it loses heat. The liquid that is cooler than the saturated liquid in the condenser is subcooled liquid. (See Figure 1.)\nSubcooling is an important process because it starts to lower the liquid temperature to the evaporator temperature. This will reduce flash loss in the evaporator, so more of the vaporization of the liquid in the evaporator can be used for useful cooling of the product load.\nA Dirty or Blocked CondenserIf a condenser becomes dirty or fouled, less heat transfer can take place from the refrigerant to the surrounding ambient. Dirty or blocked condensers are one of the most frequent service problems in commercial refrigeration and summer air conditioning fields today. If less heat can be rejected to the surrounding air with an air-cooled condenser, the heat will start to accumulate in the condenser. This accumulation of heat in the condenser will make the condensing temperature rise. Now that the condensing temperature is rising, there will come a point where the temperature difference between the condensing temperature and the surrounding ambient (Delta T) is great enough to reject heat from the condenser.\nRemember, a temperature difference is the driving potential for heat transfer to take place between anything. The greater the temperature difference, the greater the heat transfer. The condenser is now rejecting enough heat at the elevated Delta T to keep the system running with a dirty condenser. However, the system is now running very inefficiently because of the higher condensing temperature and pressure causing high compression ratios.\nSometimes you come across an air conditioning condensing unit that has started to become overrun by ferns. You may also see clothes drier lint stuck to the coil. The placement of the clothes drier vent can cause any small or large pieces of lint escaping the vent to get sucked into the condenser coil. A combination of fern leaves and lint can partially block the condenser’s airflow, which causes high condenser pressures and inefficiencies.\nFor example: Let’s say an R-134a air-cooled condenser is running at a condensing pressure of 147 psig (110?F) at an ambient of 90?. (See Table 1.) This is a Delta T of 20?. If this condenser becomes dirty or is blocked, the condensing pressure might rise to 215 psig (135?) at the same 90? ambient. The Delta T or temperature difference between the condensing temperature and the ambient is now 45?. The condenser can reject heat at this Delta T, but it makes the entire system very inefficient. Often, if a high-pressure control is not protecting the system, a compressor burnout can occur with time.\nClearance SpacePiston-type compressors all have some clearance space between the valve plate and the piston’s face to avoid a collision of the two. Modern compressor technology has lessened this clearance space, but some always exists. At the piston’s top dead center position, discharge gas gets trapped in this clearance space. When the piston starts its downstroke, this trapped discharge gas must re-expand to the suction line pressure before the suction valve will open. If a condenser is running with a high head pressure, a higher-pressure gas will be trapped in the clearance space. This requires more re-expansion of discharge gas that must take place before its pressure reaches the suction line pressure, which allows for the suction valve to open. The bottom line is a wasted portion of the suction stroke to re-expansion of discharge gas. This causes low volumetric efficiencies. The system will then run longer, be less efficient, and draw higher amps.\nHigher Subcooled Liquid TemperaturesWith a dirty or blocked condenser, even the subcooled liquid temperature coming out of the condenser will be at a higher temperature. This means that the liquid temperature out of the condenser will be further from the evaporating temperature. This will cause more flash gas at the metering device and a lower net refrigeration effect in the evaporator.\nHigher Discharge TemperaturesThe compressor’s discharge temperature will also run hotter because of the higher condensing temperature and pressure causing a higher compression ratio. The compressor will now have to put more energy in compressing the suction pressure vapors to the higher condensing or discharge pressure. This added energy is reflected in higher discharge temperatures and higher amperage draws. The compressor discharge temperature should never exceed 225? about 6 in. from the compressor. Discharge hotter than 225? will cause compressor failures in the near future.\nA condensing unit may recycle some hot discharge air because of the house’s overhang. The hot air discharged out the top of the condenser may hit the overhang and be recycled back into the side of the condenser. Try to position these types of condensing units away from protruding overhangs if possible.\nCondensing units located on the east side of a building will usually experience shade during the hottest times of the day. This helps keep condensing pressures down. Also, on condensing units that discharge air from their sides, never face a condensing unit’s fan directly into the prevailing wind direction. This will hinder the airflow out of the condensing unit on a windy day. It also may rotate the fan on the off-cycle and cause fan motor starting problems.\nTomczyk is a professor of hvacr at Ferris State University, Big Rapids, MI, and author of the book Troubleshooting and Servicing Modern Air Conditioning and Refrigeration Systems, published by ESCO Press.

{"question":"How do Ultra Filtration (UF) and conventional water treatment plant filtration compare in removing contaminants and maintaining water quality?","answer":"Conventional water treatment plants use processes like coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation, and standard filtration to remove contaminants including suspended solids, bacteria, viruses, chemicals, and heavy metals. In contrast, Ultra Filtration is a filtration system with extremely high retention of particles, including parasites, bacteria, and viruses. However, UF systems can become breeding grounds for bacteria and are typically too expensive for wastewater treatment due to large power consumption and maintenance costs. While UF systems can clean and sanitize themselves daily, they only remove but don't kill contaminants, and their effectiveness can be compromised if they become slimed.","context":["Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) About Water Treatment Plants\nWhat is a water treatment plant (WTP)?\nA water treatment plant is a facility designed to purify and clean water from various sources, such as rivers, lakes, or groundwater, to make it safe and suitable for drinking, industrial processes, and other purposes.\nWhy are water treatment plants necessary?\nWater treatment plants are essential to remove contaminants, pathogens, and impurities from raw water sources to ensure the supply of clean and safe drinking water and to protect public health.\nHow does a water treatment plant work?\nWater treatment plants use a combination of physical, chemical, and biological processes to treat water.

Reducing water usage helps preserve water resources and reduces the energy and resources required for treatment.","“What is the most effective method of disinfection for treated sewage water, Ozonation or Ultra Filtration? How much can we expect from Ozonation?” asks Tajuddin Shaik, Assistant Manager-Sales and Proposals, Zion Enviro Systems Pvt Ltd. Excerpts of a Linkedin Discussion.\nMisha Shifrin, Ozone Application Engineer-Absolute Ozone®: Ozone is the most effective and economical way to disinfect water; however it is unreasonably expensive to be used instead of filtration or bulk BOD/COD removal. That is the place where mechanical filtration, bio-filtration, aeration etc. are most efficient and cost effective.\nUltra filtration is way too expensive to be used for waste water, because of large power consumption and maintenance costs. Most of the ultra-filtration systems could easily become breeding grounds for bacteria and viruses.\nJim Wark, Application Specialist-Neotech Aqua Solutions: Depending on the clarity, (actually UVT%) UV could be a way. We have several companies we are working with in water reuse using UV as the primary disinfectant and if needed chlorine for residual. The three most important things needed are Peak flow rate, UVT % and what one is treating.\nAlfonso Carpio, Water Treatment Professional: UV is usually 4 log reduction but can be sized for as many log reduction as needed. I would use mixed oxidant disinfectant generator as it leaves a good amount of residual that can be an assurance for a complete kill of the entire population in the spectrum.\nOrlando D. Gutierrez Coronado, Project Engineer-GEOFUTURE: In general, the ozone could give the best cost-effective performance in the long run. If you will evaluate the project just for a few months, then you could disinfect with any other chemical substance as PAA, or even rent an ozone machine.\nIn this case we are considering the sewage treated water that could have some of the above described substances to interfere with the UVT.\nAlfonso: I suppose UF has been mistakenly mentioned to be UV. UF is not a disinfecting equipment but a filtration medium. To further advance my advocacy on mixed oxidant, it’s more advantageous in providing the residual especially in long distribution pipelines where one would like to measure the amount of residual present to give you peace of mind. It also eliminate the biofilm which can house those organisms that we don’t usually see in any bacterial count in the field.\nColin Deakin, Process Engineer UF/MBR, GE Water & Process Technologies: I agree with Alfonso. UF is a filtration system, but has an extremely high degree of retention of particles including parasites, bacteria and viruses. Typically current system designs will clean and therefore sanitise themselves daily, and can also test themselves for integrity at the same frequency. These two factors go together in maintaining the desired quality. However, meeting something like title 22 for recycle water quality involving human contact requires demonstration of disinfection to 5 log virus. For something like this, UF and disinfection is likely to be required. UF does the bulk of the work removing the major part of the particulate load allowing the disinfection step to work optimally and reliably.\nØyvind Thorsen, Sales Engineer at Sterner AquaTech AS: I support those who have noticed the importance of not forgetting UV as an alternative. There is a huge development in UV for the time being. Look at Wedecos Duron system which we already have installed in Norway where you have longer life time on lamps and much higher UVC output per lamp than we had previously.\nJim: UV is very effective in wastewater treatment when the proper pretreatment and analysis is done. It in fact is one of the least expensive in overall operating and capital costs. The three things which are absolutely needed for UV to be considered:\n1. UVT% which is the transmissivity of UV through water, unlike turbidity or colour, can be very tricky. Ocean water for example handles UV well, bottled water with a pinch of sugar does not.\n2. Peak Flow rates: UV must be sized for the highest flow, although in most cases, it can be run at lower flow rate.\n3. What you are trying to reduce? Is it crypto? Giardia? E-Coli? or something else, it then must be dosed properly.\nUV has changed dramatically over the last few years; we can now treat higher flows with less energy and a much smaller footprint if the water clarity is good. If not, calculations need to be made for proper sizing and equipment choices.\nSimon Tarlovsky, Regional Sales manager-Aquatech: Just as an additional comment, Ozone and UV are in the same family of treatment, they will kill but not remove, UF is different, will remove but not kill. You need to also consider the failure option in your analysis, what if your execution fails and your kill or removal are not complete.\nThe problem with UF is that it can be a breeding ground and it can just stop working when slimed.\nThe problem with UV and Ozone is that it kills but does not remove some spores which are resistant to this treatment. If you don’t keep track of the system, you can have local or general under kill.\nIn the beverage industry, reuse of any water that has been in contact with waste water, is not yet acceptable, but with enough care and supervision, waste water is not worst than any other water for drinking, when properly treated.\nMisha Shifrin: Most of the people here not only know how UV works, but have actual experience with using UV. Without cost comparison UV is only good for people who sell it as they make money on service and light bulb replacement for years to come.\nUnlike UV, zone will kill, remove bacteria, viruses, etc., and there are no ozone resistant organisms as ozone is the strongest commercially available oxidizer and it simply burns all organic materials and oxidizes minerals if applied correctly.\nJim: Why then are there more UV systems in use for wastewater treatment than O3 in the US? Ozone is a fine treatment method, no question…But others have abilities too.\nLouis Coulthard, Cricket Manager-USRC-Millennium: I have used UV, O3 & straight up simple chlorine to good effect depending on the circumstance. In industrial waste water treatment, turbidity is often a problem negating UV and associated lamp replacement costs and clyptosporidium are unheard of negating the need for & dangers of O3 in unskilled hands. Most cases, straight up chlorination & de-chlorination is simplest & best.\nMisha: UV today in the long run will considerably be more expensive than ozone and other alternatives and does not really present an economical solution for large spectrum of applications. Especially wastewater treatment. However it is a great business for people who sell UV tubes every year and I perfectly understand why UV is so vigorously promoted. Water treatment in general has taken a hard beating by\nthose who used to go around and make claims that couldn’t be justified and took people’s money.

{"question":"Can you tell what art movements or inspiration each river give? Hudson River School vs Singapore River?","answer":"Both rivers have inspired artistic and cultural movements. The Hudson River inspired the Hudson River School of art, which focused on preserving the river's natural and cultural landscape and influenced environmental law development. The Singapore River's artistic legacy is represented through public art installations that commemorate the early settlers and river life, with installations placed along the river depicting the lives of early inhabitants.","context":["the river of life\nNobody encapsulates the spirit of the Singapore River more than the figure of Sir Stamford Raffles, the founder of modern Singapore. Make your way down to the River, and just at the side of the Asian Civilisation Museum is this imposing figure of the man himself, hands folded across as if very pleased with how it has all turned out.\nWith bold vision, he and his early pioneering colleagues from the British East India Company decided that this little 'insignificant' river would be the very heart and soul of the nascent settlement known as Singapura. History was much more kinder to him than fate, and the River did become the centre of commerce and life of this island nation. Even today, tall skyscrapers line the River as if in a bid to gain Raffles' approving nod, housing corporations and enterprises that epitomises global trade and finance. This humble River has seen it all and still holds sway. Come walk down her promenade and imagine a time in history where the early settlers and traders also did the same.\nA Brief History\nThe earliest inhabitants of the Singapore River were believed to be the nomadic Orang Laut (Sea Gypsies) that lived on their boats along the River banks, choosing that over living on the shores. The River hundreds of years ago were marsh swamps that had to be drained when Sir Stamford Raffles the founder of modern Singapore arrived and started to develop Singapore from 1819. His striking white marble statue right next to the Asian Civilisation Museum stands on the site believed to be where he came ashore and signed a treaty with the Temengong Abdul Rahman (Chief of Singapore) who lived along the river at that stretch. Raffles envisioned that this place should become a \"great emporium of trade\" and set out a town plan based on the various communities settling around the a river based port enterprise.\nFor the next few decades, the River became the very centre of the busy port city of Singapore, starting from the mouth of the River stretching over 3km up river. In the mid and late 19th century it attracted traders and merchants, labourers and adventurers who traveled from near and far, and settled on both sides of the river. It was truly the lifeblood of all the business activities here in Singapore, true then and still is now.\nBritish and other European merchants mingled with Chinese Towkays (bosses) and Indian business owners, who also in turn collaborated with traders from Java, Sumatra, Sulawesi and as far afield as Arabs from the Middle East. All along the river, quaint shop houses are remnants of that past. They were warehouses, godowns, retail shops, offices, and over crowded residences of the early immigrants to come ashore. At one time they become derelict in the 70s and 80s, in danger of being completely bulldozed and replaced with towering skyscrapers to keep up with the times. They were thankfully conserved, restored and given a new lease of life and today serve as hip and vibrant enclaves for the coolest in riverside F&B offerings. The tall sky scrapers of the commercial heart of Singapore known as Raffles Place now loom over Boat Quay, housing regional and global headquarters and offices of major local and international banking & financial institutions, insurance and trading firms.\nBefore a massive government led effort at cleaning up the river in the late 1970s, the River itself was polluted and chocked, with putrid stench of refuse and garbage that was strewn upstream, from pig and vegetable farms, roads, drains and streams that fed the River. It was a bold and ambitious plan to clean up the River in 10 years, and make it once again attractive and pleasant for the enjoyment of those who visited it. Over the years it was also widen and deepen to facilitate boats plying the length of the River. Now pleasure River Cruises travel up and down the River.\nThe once tidal-river used to empty into the sea known as the Singapore Straits. Now it flows into the Marina Bay, created when the Marina Barrage (a dam) was built over the mouth of the Marina Channel some 2km away. It created the only urban water catchment reservoir within the city, of which the Singapore River is a major source.\nThe Bridges over the Singapore River are also worth a mention as over the course of history they helped to connect between the communities of the residential districts of the Chinese in Chinatown and the Indians of Kampung Chulia (Indian village) in the south with the European communities and wealthier Asians in the north. Bridges like Anderson Bridge, Coleman Bridge, Elgin Bridge, Read Bridge bear names of their designers or British governors of Malaya and Calcutta.

The Hudson River Valley may be America’s premier river environmental laboratory, and by bringing historians and social scientists together with biologists and other physical scientists, this book hopes to foster new ways of looking at and talking about this historically, commercially, and aesthetically important ecosystem.\nNative people’s influences on the ecological integrity of aquatic and shoreline communities were generally local and minor, and for the first 12,000 years or so of human use, the Hudson River was valued mainly as a source of water, food, and transportation. Since the arrival of European colonists, however, commerce has been the engine that has driven development and use of the river, from the harvesting of beaver pelts and timber to the siting of manufacturing industries and power plants, and all of these uses have had pervasive effects on the river’s aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems. In the meantime, aesthetic movements such as the Hudson River School of painting have sought to recover and preserve the earlier pastoral landscape, anticipating the more recent efforts by environmentalists that have led to dramatic improvements in water quality, shoreline habitats, and fish populations.\nDespite the pervasive forces of commerce, the Hudson River has retained its world-class scenic qualities. The Upper Hudson remains today a free-flowing, tumbling mountain stream, and the Lower Hudson a fjord penetrated and dominated by the Hudson Highlands. The Hudson’s unique history continues to affect current uses and will surely influence the future in remarkable ways.\n“…the book offers several valuable contributions to our understanding of the Hudson and its environmental history … it brings to public attention the importance and complexity of one of America’s great rivers.” — H-Net Reviews (H-Environment)\n“Section introductions by the editor, Robert E. Henshaw, successfully weave the disparate topics into a cohesive chronicle … The book eloquently concludes that ‘the Hudson River has been uniquely important to New York’s culture, history, commerce, and tourism.’ It also has forged a link between the interrelated aspects of city and country, technology and nature, industry and leisure, and business and art.” — Kaatskill Life\n“…captures the Hudson’s complex identity and defines the importance of the river both as its own entity and to the region it supports.” — Hudson River Valley Review\n“Overall, the book makes a strong case for the important roles that the Hudson Valley’s citizenry played in US transportation systems (first steamship and railroad), art (Hudson River School), law (litigation leading to landmark environmental legislation), conservation (Theodore Roosevelt while New York governor), and environmental and ecological investigations. This extensive account provides an optimistic picture of the region’s current situation and future prospects despite some lingering problems (including urban sprawl) … Highly recommended.” — CHOICE\nRobert E.

{"question":"What are the common side effects when using Botox versus Xeomin for facial treatments, based on clinical data?","answer":"Botox typically causes mild discomfort, minor bruising, swelling, and headaches. Xeomin's side effects can include bleeding and bruising at the injection site, allergic reactions (itching, swelling, shortness of breath), and when used for facial treatments, it shares similar risks with all botulinum toxin products, including the potential for spreading from the injection site to other body parts. Both products are considered safe when properly administered.","context":["Botox Injections Procedures, Risks and Alternatives\nBotox is becoming an increasingly popular way for women (and men) to rejuvenate their skin and look younger. But what exactly is botox, and how does it work? Moreover, are there any risks involved with the procedure? This article answers all of these questions and more.\nWhat is Botox?\nThe full, scientific name for botox is Botulinum Toxin. It is produced by a bacterium and was discovered over one hundred years ago; however, it was only in the last few decades that botox was seen to have a practical use in treating muscle spasms.\nNowadays, botox is used to treat a range of ailments, from lazy eye and uncontrolled blinking to back and neck pain. But botox is most widely used by the cosmetic industry as a non-surgical means of smoothing out lines and facial creases. By blocking certain nerve impulses, botox stops the muscle contractions that lead to wrinkles.\nWhat is the procedure?\nThe botox application is relatively simple, and does not require an anesthetic. A fine needle injects the botox into the skin in the desired area, and the full procedure takes only a few minutes. In order to minimize the risk of bruising, you are advised to avoid alcohol and anti-inflammatory medication for two weeks prior to the procedure. The beneficial effects of botox usually last between three to four months.\nWhat are the risks and side effects?\nMedical authorities consider botox to be a very safe procedure. Most people only experience mild discomfort when botox is applied, but some patients experience minor bruising, swelling, and headaches.\nIf too much botox is applied, it can cause a “frozen look” whereby too many of the face’s muscles have been immobilized. It is important patients seek a qualified plastic surgeon or medical professional and communicate the look they are trying to achieve to make sure the Botox is applied in a way to achieve this.\nHow much does it cost?\nBotox is usually priced at around $10 to $18 “per unit” – The cost varies with whether a board certified plastic surgeon or dermatologist is applying it, or a nurse or other medical technician in a spa. Beware of deals that are too cheap since they may not be using Botox from an FDA approved supplier. Different areas require different amounts to treat. For example for the horizontal lines of the forehead – this requires anywhere from 12-20 units to treat. The “11” is anywhere from 10-14 units. The amount varies with each person’s anatomy.\nAre there any natural alternative treatments?\nBecause of the well-publicized success of botox in making people appear younger, a number of natural treatments have come onto the market. These claim to achieve the same result, but without the need for needles, and at a reduced cost.\nAmong the non-injectable products available are Frownies, serums, washes and moisturizers and anti-oxidants. Nothing is as effective as Botox which acts at the neuromuscular junction to prevent muscle contractions that create wrinkles but a good skincare regimen of cleansers and moisturizers is important for overall skin maintenance.","Xeomin (incobotulinumtoxinA), made by Merz Pharmaceuticals, is approved by the US FDA for the treatment of adults with cervical dystonia or blepharospasm and Moderate to severe frown lines between the eyebrows. IncobotulinumtoxinA is made from the bacteria that causes botulism. Botulinum toxin blocks nerve activity in the muscles, causing a temporary reduction in muscle activity.\nFDA approval of XEOMIN, was based on the results of two U.S. clinical trials. A study cited in the Journal of Neurological Sciences on the efficacy and safety of XEOMIN found it showed “non-inferiority” to Botox when used in the same doses to treat cervical dystonia. It concluded that XEOMIN is a safe and effective treatment for the disorder.\nXeomin has now been approved for some cosmetic indications – Moderate to severe frown lines between the eyebrows. Similiar to other drugs in this category, including Botox and Dysport, that also have FDA approval for the treatment of facial wrinkles. Now that Xeomin is available and FDA approved, doctors can use it both on-label and off-label to treat the same facial lines treated by Botox and Dysport, including frown lines, crow’s feet and forehead wrinkles.\nWorldwide, more than 84,000 people have been treated with Xeomin injections. The U.S. is actually the 20th country to approve this new drug. It is available in 50-unit and 100-unit vials.\nBetter or worse then Botox?\nXeomin is the first one that does not need to be refrigerated before use, which may simplify distribution. Xeomin is also has no additives, just botulinum toxin type A. This may mean that there is less risk of developing antibodies against Xeomin than other available neurotoxins. The body develops antibodies in response to a foreign invader and attacks. In theory, antibodies could prevent a neurotoxin from having its desired effects. The effects of Xeomin occur within one week, and the results last from three to six months, making it comparable to Botox in terms of both onset and duration of action. Xeomin should not be used interchangeably with other botulinum products.\nWhat are the risks?\nThere is a risk that all botulinum toxin products may spread from the area where they were injected to other parts of the body, causing potentially life-threatening swallowing and breathing problems. This was predominantly seen in children treated with Botox off-label for cerebral palsy. These issues have not been reported among people who received botulinum products for cosmetic uses or to treat blepharospasm.\nOther risks may include bleeding and bruising at the injection site and allergic reactions such as itching, swelling or shortness of breath. Your doctor should discuss all the potential risks of this procedure with you during your consultation.\nWhen Xeomin is used to treat cervical dystonia, side effects include neck pain, muscle weakness, injection site pain and musculoskeletal pain. When used to treat blepharospasm, the most common side effects of Xeomin were eyelid sagging, dry eye, dry mouth, diarrhea, headache, visual impairment, shortness of breath (dyspnea), and upper respiratory infections.\nHow much does Xeomin cost?\nXeomin costs will likely be comparable to Botox if not slightly lower. Exact price points are not yet available since Xeomin was so recently approved for use in the U.S. If your doctor suggests Xeomin, make sure to get accurate pricing information before booking your appointment."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7ba22dc9-c4cb-4907-80fc-c886eb0b6e79>","<urn:uuid:5b866b29-74c1-4eec-a683-58c30484e97b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"鬼屋的烟雾探测系统activation后应该触发什么safety措施? 🤔","answer":"When the smoke detection system is activated in a haunted house, it must trigger two main safety measures: 1) Sound an alarm at a constantly attended location on the premises, and 2) If the system has cross zoning capability, it must provide increased illumination of the means of egress and terminate any confusing visual or sound effects.","context":["Before getting into this week’s Fire Code topic I want to highlight my coworker’s latest blog post, Planning for the unthinkable in assembly venues with the Life Safety Code. Greg, a Principal Engineer in the Building Fire Protection and Life Safety Department at NFPA, discusses how the scope and provisions of NFPA 101 apply to the recent tragedy in Las Vegas and how we, as safety professionals, can contribute to occupant safety in the future. I am truly saddened by the events that required such a post be written in the first place, but cannot deny that we, as professionals, need to keep pushing forward and making changes and doing our best to make this world a safer place. Thanks, Greg, for the timely and thoughtful information.\nOnto NFPA 1.\nDo you ever feel like you are preparing for the holidays months in advance these days? Just the other day I heard a holiday ad on the radio and saw Christmas decorations on display while shopping. Whether we are ready or not, the “holiday season” is here. A common fixture during during fall is the haunted house. Large or small, permanent or temporary, professional or amateur, haunted houses are popping up everywhere, especially in buildings not originally designed to accommodate such use. Unfortunately, haunted houses can cause nightmares for more than just those that attend. Without the proper knowledge and understanding of the codes that apply, haunted houses can be a safety nightmare as well.\nPer NFPA 1, Fire Code, a haunted house is considered a special amusement building. By definition, a special amusement building is \"a building that is temporary, permanent, or mobile and contains a device or system that conveys passengers or provides a walkway along, around, or over a course in any direction as a form of amusement arranged so that the egress path is not readily apparent due to visual or audio distractions or an intentionally confounded egress path, or is not readily available due to the mode of conveyance through the building or structure.\" A special amusement building is an assembly occupancy regardless of occupant load.\nHaunted houses use special effects, scenery, props, and audio and visual distractions that may cause egress paths to become not obvious. In haunted houses in particular, the presence of combustible materials and special scenery can also contribute to the fuel load should a fire occur. Because of this, the Code requirements are purposely strict to in hopes of avoiding a potentially disastrous fire event.\nCode provisions for special amusement buildings are found in Section 20.1.4 of NFPA 1. The Code requirements for haunted houses are summarized below:\n- Haunted houses must apply the provisions for assembly occupancies in addition to the provisions of Section 20.1.4.\n- Automatic sprinklers are required for all haunted houses. If the haunted house is considered moveable or portable, an approved temporary means is permitted to be used for water supply.\n- Smoke detection is required throughout the haunted house where the nature it operates in reduced lighting and the actuation of any smoke detection device must sound an alarm at a constantly attended location on the premises.\n- Actuation of sprinklers or any suppression systems, smoke detection system (having a cross zoning capability) must provide an increase in illumination of the means of egress and termination of other confusing visuals or sounds.\n- Exit marking and floor proximity exit signs are required. Where designs are such that the egress path is not apparent, additional directional exit marking is required.\n- Interior wall and ceiling finish materials must be Class A throughout.\n- Per Section 10.8.1, emergency action plans are required.\nOther requirements, not specific just to haunted houses or special amusement buildings, may also apply:\n- Permits (see Section 1.12)\n- Seasonal buildings (see Section 10.12)\n- Special outdoor events, fairs and carnivals (see Section 10.14)\nAs we move into the Halloween and haunted house season, it’s easy to get caught up in the fun and overlook the safety issues that may arise. Through the provisions in NFPA 1, which can assist fire code officials and inspectors enforce safe haunted houses, and NFPA's halloween resources for consumers, everyone can stay safe this season.\nThank you for reading, stay safe!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:29e5d214-6ab1-43f8-beaa-c7aeb76ae19a>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between the special needs provisions in Maryland's BOOST Program and Kentucky's Preschool Special Needs Services regarding funding and evaluation processes?","answer":"In Maryland's BOOST Program, special needs provisions focus primarily on funding, with $0.7 million set aside for higher vouchers for students with special needs. The program's advisory board considers a student's special needs when determining scholarship amounts. In contrast, Kentucky's Preschool Special Needs Services has a comprehensive evaluation process involving multiple steps: referral, screening, Response To Intervention (RTI), formal evaluation across six developmental areas (social/emotional, adaptive, gross motor, fine motor, communication, and cognitive), and ongoing assessment. Kentucky's program requires completion of evaluation within 60 school days after obtaining parental consent and includes development of an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) if the child qualifies.","context":["Broadening Options and Opportunities for Students Today (BOOST) Program\n- Enacted 2016\n- Launched 2016\nMaryland’s Broadening Options and Opportunities for Students Today (BOOST) Program, the state’s first private school choice program, provides vouchers to low-income students to attend private schools.

The program’s advisory board takes into account a student’s special needs when determining scholarship amounts and may fund these students with higher vouchers than the per-pupil average.\nThe Maryland legislature established the program as a budget item, and it is funded by appropriation. It appropriated $10 million from the general fund to fund vouchers for students as well as awarded rollover funds for the 2021–22 school year. Of the appropriation, $0.7 million is set aside for providing higher vouchers to students with special needs.\nStudents are eligible if they live in families with incomes up to, but not exceeding, 100 percent of the federal free and reduced-price lunch program ($51,338 for a family of four in 2022-23). Renewing students who remain income-eligible are entitled to vouchers as long as funding is available.\nEdChoice Expert Feedback\nMaryland’s Broadening Options and Opportunities for Students Today (BOOST) Program helps thousands of students access schools that are the right fit for them, but policymakers could do much more to expand educational opportunity.\nEligibility for the scholarships is limited to 185 percent of the federal poverty line. Around one in five Maryland students are eligible for a scholarship and less than 1 percent of students statewide actually use a scholarship.\nThe average scholarship size is about $3,134, which is about 19 percent of the average expenditure per student at Maryland’s district schools. The amount of scholarships budgeted for the 2022-23 academic year is only $10 million, which is equivalent to only 0.76 percent of Maryland’s total K–12 expenditures.\nIn order to expand access to educational choice, Maryland policymakers should dramatically increase funding for the scholarship and expand eligibility to all students (prioritizing scholarships based on need). Instead of funding the scholarships via an annual line-item appropriation, the scholarships should be formula funded. The program could also be converted into an education savings account to ensure that all students have access to the education that’s the right fit for them, whether private school or a customized course of education.\nAdditionally, Maryland’s scholarship program has some unnecessary and counterproductive regulations. The program requires the Maryland Department of Education to “compile and certify” a list of applicants and rank them by eligibility before sending to the BOOST advisory board. Though this was likely intended to provide the most aid to the most disadvantaged students, this policy creates unnecessary invasions of privacy and forces a ranking system for students already eligible for the program. Schools participating in this program also must adhere to Maryland’s Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended and Title 20 Subtitle 6 of the State Governor Article, which requires private schools eligible for vouchers to not discriminate in student admissions, retention, expulsion or otherwise based on race, color, national origin, sexual orientation or gender identity or expression. Although the program includes a protection for religious liberty (“Nothing herein shall require any school or institution to adopt any rule, regulation, or policy that conflicts with its religious or moral teachings”), the state government expelled one private religious school from participating in the program due to its stated beliefs about marriage and sexuality, even though the school fully complied with the state’s nondiscrimination policy concerning admissions.

Salmon held that the state board administering the BOOST voucher program violated the First Amendment free speech rights of Bethel Christian Academy when it removed and excluded the school from the voucher program. The Court opined that the state violated the constitution when it “conditioned government funding on a viewpoint-based restriction of speech” and violated the Unconstitutional Conditions doctrine.\nSchools participating in the BOOST program are prohibited from discriminating against students in the admissions process based on sexual orientation or gender identity. Bethel did not violate this nondiscrimination law. The case began when the school was nonetheless disqualified due to statements in its parent/student handbook that marriage is “a covenant between one man and one woman,” and that gender is bestowed by God “at birth as male or female to reflect His image.” The Court declined to rule whether the BOOST program is constitutional.

To be eligible, children must meet one of the following criteria:\n- 3 or 4 years old and identified to have a developmental delay or disability, OR\n- 4 years old by August 1st of the current school year and eligible by family size and income based on Federal Guidelines for 150% poverty level. Call for income amounts for eligibility.\nA family whose child qualifies by family size and income must submit at least one of the following forms of information to verify the child’s eligibility for preschool:\n· Current pay-stub\n· Medical Card\n· Current tax return\n· SNAP (Food Stamp) eligibility documentation\n· KTAP eligibility documentation\nSpecial Education Services\nEarly educational services can maximize a child’s educational outcomes and enhance success. This becomes even more important when a child has a developmental delay or disability. Early intervention can minimize the effects of the disabling condition, and prevent additional delays. Special education services are available for children who have a developmental delay or disability, age 3 to 21, as established by federal regulations and guidelines (IDEA), and the regulations set forth by the Kentucky Education Reform Act of 1990.\nPreschool Special Needs Services are provided for 3, 4, and 5 year olds who have one or more of the following:\n· Developmental Delay – skills are delayed in one or more developmental areas.\n· Disability – children diagnosed as needing special services in order to benefit from education due to disability or condition.\nChildren must meet state and federal criteria to be eligible for preschool special needs services. Eligibility for special needs services is determined through specific evaluation procedures according to state criteria, regulation and guidelines.\nSteps for Determining Eligibility\n1. Referral: A child can be referred to the school system by a parent, teacher, professional agency, physician, etc. A referral should be made when there is any concern or possibility of delay or disability.\n2. Screening: Screening is a brief assessment that takes a snap shot of your child’s development, to determine whether or not further evaluation is needed. During this time you will be included as a member of the assessment team (parents, educators, speech and language pathologists, para educators, and special needs itinerant teachers) to identify your childs skills in the following development areas:\na. Gross / Fine Motor\nd. Self Help\ne. Social Emotional\nf. Vision / Hearing\n3. RTI (Response To Intervention): The screening instrument will identify areas of need for further evaluation. In response to those needs, the preschool staff will provide instructional intervention sessions, and collect data to determine your child’s progress with instruction. If you are unable to attend the instruction sessions, intervention strategies and data collection methods will be provided to the parents/ guardians for the child in their natural environment. At the conclusion of the intervention, the child’s progress will be evaluated and reported to the parent(s). At this time, if warranted, the referral process will include an Admissions and Release Committee (ARC) meeting to determine any need for further formal evaluation.\n4. Evaluation: The evaluation consists of an assessment across developmental areas or skills, including observation, interview, and direct testing components to determine a child’s skills, educational abilities, and needs. The parent must provide signed consent for the evaluation. Once the consent is obtained, the district has 60 school days to complete the evaluation. The evaluation will be completed through play with your child and will prove to be a fun experience for them. You are a valuable team member in this process as you provide information on their developmental history, observations, and review of records. The following areas will be assessed in the developmental evaluation:\na. Social/Emotional: interaction with peers and adults and the ability to follow directions\nb. Adaptive: toileting, dressing, feeding, attending to tasks\nc. Gross Motor: large motor movements such as running, jumping, hopping, and skipping\nd. Fine Motor: small motor movements such as cutting, drawing, and stringing beads\ne. Communication: ability to understand spoken language, expressing wants and needs clearly, and following direction\nf. Cognitive: early learning skills such as matching, memory, counting, and naming colors\n5. Determining Eligibility: You will meet with others working with your child as a team (including a district representative, special needs itinerant teacher, classroom teacher, and other related service personnel as appropriate, to review evaluation results. The team will determine the child’s strengths, needs, and eligibility for any services. If your child is eligible for special needs services, an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) is developed by the team to meet his/her individual needs. WIth parental consent, this IEP defines the educational services implemented for your child. If your child is determined NOT eligible for services, our family resource center coordinator will meet with you to determine other options (including private school programming, Headstart services, and other community options available for you and your child.\n6. On-Going Assessment: If your child is enrolled in the public preschool program, you will be provided on-going progress on your child’s individual goals and objectives. Your child’s teacher will administer curriculum based assessment, which provides authentic assessment of your child’s developmental progress.

{"question":"What are the potential risks of excess moisture exposure for both humidifiers and wooden cabinet surfaces in indoor environments?","answer":"For humidifiers, excess moisture can lead to mold growth which causes adverse health effects, and can damage wallpaper, plaster and paint. Similarly for wooden cabinets, repeated exposure to moisture from sources like kitchen sinks, bathroom splashing, or steam from cook tops and appliances can damage wood cabinetry finishes and substrates. Both scenarios demonstrate how excessive moisture can be detrimental to both home fixtures and indoor environments.","context":["As the winter approaches, you may begin to notice that your mouth, throat, nose and eyes feel drier. These symptoms could be due to low moisture levels in your home.\nInhaling dry indoor air can be detrimental to your health. It can cause skin irritation, asthma, colds, bronchitis, dry throat, or even nose bleeding. Dry air can also cause wood furniture to dry out and crack. Besides, moist air conducts temperature better, especially during winter and helps indoor plants to thrive.\nIn this article, we discuss the various ways you can humidify a room, including using a humidifier and 8 alternative methods.\nHow to Measure Humidity Levels in Your Home\nThe best way to measure humidity levels in your home is by using a hygrometer. It is an inexpensive humidity gauge that you can find in your local hardware store. It will indicate the exact moisture levels in a room.\nIdeally, the moisture levels should range between 35-50%. If lower, the indoor air is dry, while if it is above 60%, the room is over-humidified.\nHow to Use a Humidifier to Humidify a Room\nHumidifiers are appliances that produce water vapor to add moisture to the air. They are available in different sizes and designs.\nTypes of Humidifiers\nThere are 5 main types of home humidifies as follows:\n- Evaporative humidifiers. Their design constitutes of 3 main parts – a water reservoir, wick, and a fan. The wick absorbs water from the reservoir, and the fan distributes it to the room as cool moisture. These types of humidifiers are quite affordable but are prone to mold growth in the wick pad and reservoir.\n- Vapor humidifiers. They are also known as warm mist humidifiers. They operate by boiling water to create steam. They have a fan that distributes the steam. Their main advantage is that heating the water gets rid of pathogens and inhibits mild growth.\nOn the downside, they use up more energy to heat the water. Also, if knocked over, the hot water can cause scalding.\n- Ultrasonic humidifiers. Although a few can boil water or use UV light to sterilize the water, they are cool air appliances. They have vibrating ceramic discs that pulverize water into tiny droplets that are released into the air. They are quite safe but may release water minerals to the immediate environment.\n- Impeller humidifiers. These are cool air humidifiers. They have rotating discs that rotate at high speed, releasing water droplets in the air. The mist is visible. They can over-humidify a room if not correctly set.\n- Central humidifiers. The above types of humidifiers are portable and designed for single room use. On the other hand, central humidifies as fitted permanently as part of the HVAC system to humidify the entire house. Some have a rotating drum that pulverizes water into mist, while others steam the water.\nThese units are expensive to install but effective at humidifying the entire house. Since central humidifiers are more complex to install, it is best to consult an HVAC professional before buying one.\nTips for Using a Humidifier\n- Do not place the humidifier on a carpet, metallic, or wooden surface. The moisture may damage these types of surfaces. If placing it on the floor, ensure it is two feet above the ground.\n- Use the humidifier as need be. For example, run the humidifier for a few minutes in your bedroom before going to bed. Or for a few minutes near tropical house plants. Run the humidifier constantly if you live in low humidity areas or during low humidity season\n- Refill the humidifier regularly. For instance, a one-liter humidifier will need to be refilled with water after running for 8 hours. In comparison, a 3-gallon unit needs refilling after 12-15 hours. It is best to change the water with every refill to prevent bacteria manifestation.\n- Use purified, distilled water instead of tap water in the humidifier. Tap water has high levels of minerals that build up as plaque in the humidifier and wear out the filters. These minerals could also deposit on the surrounding surfaces.\n- Clean and sterilize your humidifier regularly. At least 1-3 times per week. The EPA recommends using 3% hydrogen peroxide to clean the humidifier.\n- If you are running the humidifier for extended periods, go for one that has a built-in humidistat. It senses when humidity levels are excessively high and controls the output.\n- Consider a built-in bacterial control feature. It reduces the risk of bacteria manifestation in the water tank.\nDisadvantages of Using a Humidifier to Humidify a Room\nWhile humidifiers are generally safe to use, they are associated with certain disadvantages. For instance, they can over humidify a room. Excess moisture can lead to mold growth, which leads to adverse health effects. It can also damage wallpaper, plaster and paint.\nThey are also high maintenance as they require regular cleaning and water change. If you do not clean it regularly and properly, it can encourage bacteria incubation.\nTherefore, some people are keen to use natural, easily accessible, low-cost methods to humidify a room. Below is a look at 9 natural methods of humidifying a room.\n8 Alternative Methods of Humidify a Room\n1. Incorporate some house plants in your interior décor\nPlants absorb water from the soil through the roots for mineral transportation. They then release excess water through the leaves in the process of transpiration. They also improve aeration in the room as they take up carbon dioxide and release oxygen.\n2. Open the bathroom door when showering\nIf you can, leave the door open when showering. The steam from the showerhead or bathtub will escape to the immediate rooms increasing moisture levels.\n3. Leave water in the bathtub\nOnce you are done showering, do not drain the water in the bathtub immediately. Allow it to sit for some time. As the water cools down, some moisture will slowly evaporate into the adjacent rooms. Do not leave the bathtub with water if you have small children, as it poses the risk of drowning.\n4. Hang clothes to air-dry indoors\nSet up a drying rack in the room you want to humidify. Instead of drying your clothes in the dryer, wring out the excess water and spread them out on the drying rack. As they dry, moisture slowly evaporates to the air, humidifying it. This method is not only affordable, but it also saves you energy bills involved with using a drier. It works best for small clothes and intimates.\n5. Put clean water in a bowl and place it near a source of heat\nPut water in a metallic or ceramic bowl. Place the water near heat sources, e.g. on top of HVAC registers or near a window under direct sunlight. The heat will cause the water to warm up and evaporate into the air.\nIf the room is big or the air is too dry, place several bowls of water near heat sources in the room. Check on the bowl every few days to determine whether you need to refill it with water.\nThis method also works for glasses or vases of water. However, the water evaporates much slower than in a bowl as they have a smaller surface area. You could also place shallow trays of water in direct sunlight.\n6. Boil water on the stovetop\nBoiling water on a stovetop is one of the fastest ways to increase moisture levels in the air. Ensure to keep the cooking pot open when boiling the water to allow the moisture to evaporate. You could also boil water in a kettle and leave it on for a few more minutes to produce adequate steam to raise moisture levels in the room.\n7. Mist the room with a water spray bottle\nFill up a spray bottle and spray around the room to add moisture to the air. Although this method is effective, you can easily over mist the room. Do not mist so much that you leave wet surfaces behind. You could also mist the curtains sparingly.\n8. Use an essential oil diffuser\nEssential oil diffusers work well for humidifying smaller rooms. Since water serves as a carrier for the oil droplets, a diffuser has a humidifying effect. Unlike a humidifier, it outputs less moisture. Therefore, it may not be the best idea if the air is too dry. Keep in mind that you should only run a diffuser for 30 minutes at a time.\nThe right humidity levels in your home are essential for comfortable and healthy living. Watch out for signs of dry air and use a hygrometer to confirm the moisture levels in different rooms. Then choose one or more methods of humidifying your home from the above discussed. Be careful not to over humidify as it can have adverse side effects such as mold growth.","27 Mar Cabinet Care: Humidity and Temperature Control\nWhen it comes to cabinet care, humidity and temperature control are just as important as proper cleaning and maintenance.\nInterior climate fluctuations can create multiple symptoms, including issues with wood. To keep your cabinets and wood components at their best, maintain a consistent range of temperature and humidity within your home. Try to avoid sudden changes that may cause material swelling or shrinking and result in finish damage to your cabinetry.\nWood cabinets expand as humidity increases and shrink as humidity decreases. To achieve the best moisture conditions for your cabinets, maintain an indoor relative humidity level of 35-50 percent.\nOften, cabinet doors and/or drawer fronts are constructed of multiple wood pieces. Whether raw or finished, expansion and contraction can cause slight separations of individual pieces at joints. These separations may become visible as small cracks. This can occur with all finishes but is much more evident on painted wood than it is on stained wood.\nUnder dry conditions, cabinet door center panels may shrink and the unfinished panel edges may become visible. Exposed, unfinished panel edges will not match the finished surfaces of the rest of the panel and door. This panel shrinkage is not a reason for replacement but is instead an indication that humidity levels are too low. Increasing the humidity level above 35% will expand the panel back to its original state.\nIn certain dry climates, low indoor humidity levels often must be addressed with a whole-house humidifier. For new cabinetry, it’s a good idea to allow them to stand in the room (or an adjacent room) where they will be installed for a period of time to acclimate to the environment prior to installation. Do not store them in a garage, basement or other unheated or unconditioned space.\nInterrelated with humidity levels, temperature fluctuation in the home can produce similar problems. Increased temperature causes materials to expand, while decreased temperature causes materials to contract or shrink. Sudden climate changes may cause more dramatic material changes such as shrinkage, expansion, cracking and splitting in solid wood, and warping, cupping and bowing in wood components.\nThe recommended temperature range for the interior of the home is between 60º-80º F.\nTemperature and humidity are also affected by the following factors:\n- Proper outside drainage\n- Adequate insulation\n- Properly installed vapor barriers\n- Adequate and proper ventilation and air exchange\nRepeated exposure to moisture, such as splashing of cabinet surfaces from a kitchen or bathroom sink or food prep area, can result in damage to wood cabinetry finishes and substrates. Repeated exposure to steam from cook tops, crock pots, improperly sealed dishwasher doors and other appliances can also damage cabinetry finishes. Dry off any areas immediately where water has spilled, and avoid draping dish towels or other wet items over cabinet doors.\nMany interior environmental factors that affect human comfort also contribute to cabinet conditions. Properly controlling temperature and humidity inside your home will be healthier both for your family and for the cabinetry and furniture within."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:82529341-b0de-4336-a0a6-d1d851bd928b>","<urn:uuid:36154637-e86a-43a3-85cb-228a1123e80a>"],"error":null}

The PADI OWD Certification allows you to dive anywhere in the world to a depth of 60 feet or 18 meters, independent of professional supervision.\nThe PADI Open Water Diver Certification is composed of three distinct parts, each designed to build your knowledge and skill base until you are comfortable and confident diving on your own.\n- Knowledge Development – There are several ways to complete the Knowledge Development portion of the course work, which consists of 5 classroom sessions. Students may also opt to study online or independently on their tablet or laptop using PADI’s e-learning application. Learning the basics of scuba before you hit the water is essential and the subjects covered will enable you to build your confidence before you enter the water as well as dispel many common myths and preconceptions about scuba. Once you have finished your coursework, you will be tested on the principles of scuba. When you can demonstrate that you have retained enough to score a 75 percent or higher on an administered scuba test, you can move on to the second portion of the course.\n- Confined Water Dives – Now that you have a background in the basics of scuba and have demonstrated competency of what you have learned, the next step is to get in the water in a confined area such as a pool. The Confined Water portion of the course consists of 5 dives where the student is able to put into practice the skills and knowledge they gained during the study sessions. Under the supervision of your instructor, you will familiarize yourself with many common situations likely to encounter during your dives, such as resetting your mask or breathing off another diver’s tank. These common skills are essential to becoming a safe and confident scuba diver and will form the foundation of your skill base moving forward to the final portion of the course.\n- Open Water Dives – The final step in receiving your certification as a PADI Open Water Diver is to complete 4 Open Water dives in the majestic Pacific Ocean. Now that you have demonstrated your proficiency in the classroom and practiced and honed your skills in a limited environment, it’s time to put all that knowledge and skills to good use to explore the marine world that has been off limits previously. There is little that compares to the 360 degrees of freedom of movement that you have while scuba diving, and the marine wildlife that you will encounter will take your breath away. Once you have completed your open water dives and receive your certification, you will be free to dive anywhere in the world and experience the true variety and diversity of our amazing planet, both above and below the waves."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:2a8e7018-f7c8-4306-bfeb-212a2ae70a69>","<urn:uuid:59c227bb-a0f7-42de-8c18-a4df55703b22>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the key difference between scenario planning and strategic planning in organizations? Looking for a detailed explanation!","answer":"Scenario planning and strategic planning serve different but complementary purposes. Scenario planning focuses on exploring and preparing for hypothetical future circumstances and environments, like economic downturns or funding changes, enabling organizations to ask 'What would we do if...?' for various situations. In contrast, strategic planning is a broader management tool that aligns an organization's vision, mission, and goals, serving as a formalized roadmap for executing chosen strategies. While scenario planning helps prepare for potential future scenarios, strategic planning establishes the fundamental direction and framework for the organization, including mission statements, values, and concrete action plans.","context":["Scenario and contingency planning help nonprofit leaders plan for and react to opportunities and challenges that may arise over a given time frame. They enable nonprofits to ask and answer the question, \"What would we do if…?\" for a variety of circumstances, taking time to consider strategic implications, identify and weigh options, and agree on trade-offs.\nScenario planning enables leaders to explore and prepare for hypothetical circumstances and environments (e.g., economic downturn vs. recovery, or government funding cuts vs. growth). Contingency planning is a form of scenario planning focused on navigating worst-case scenarios (e.g., loss of primary funding, programmatic failure, adverse policy change).\nHow it's used\nScenario and contingency planning enables nonprofit leaders to prepare for potential challenges or opportunities and to be ready to respond quickly and appropriately. It asks nonprofit leaders to consider factors partially or entirely outside of the organization's control, how those factors might shift, and how the organization could respond.\nThis type of analysis allows leaders to begin adjusting plans earlier, rather than waiting until a crisis is upon the organization. If an organization needs to reduce expenses, it can preemptively prioritize which costs and investments to protect and which ones to reduce. Scenario plans can help nonprofits act quickly to seize promising opportunities. Contingency plans can help nonprofits weather worst-case scenarios (e.g., significant funding cuts, sudden loss of leadership).\nTo undertake scenario or contingency planning, an organization must have a clear sense of its current strategy and operations, and key drivers of success.\n- Identify the key factors: Begin by identifying factors that are critical to the organization's success yet uncertain or unpredictable (e.g., a government funding stream that might get cut, a new merger that might take place, an ambitious hiring target). Naturally, much about the future is unpredictable, so focus on the factors that would most significantly affect the organization's ability to reach its goals.\n- Determine possible outcomes and implications: For each of the key factors, identify the likely range of outcome scenarios for a given element of strategy (e.g., merger occurs in February, merger is delayed until August, merger falls through) and, if practical, try to assign at least rough probabilities for each. Then, systematically think through how the organization would be affected by each outcome, including how each scenario would affect operations, growth, outcomes, and finances.\n- Analyze and identify the best path: Next, determine the organization's main options for how it could respond to the various scenarios, making appropriate adjustments to its tactics or even its strategy. Weigh the pros and cons of various responses—which path will be most likely to achieve the organization's mission and goals? Think carefully about which investments, initiatives or programs must be prioritized and protected, and which ones could be postponed, reduced or eliminated.\n- Codify the triggers and scenarios: Decide what circumstances will lead the organization to make each set of potential changes. For example, \"If revenues fall by 10-percent, we will do X, and if they fall by 20-percent, we will also do Y and Z.\" Determine what indicators should be tracked to determine which scenario should be implemented.\n- Monitor environment and implement scenarios: As it moves forward, the organization should monitor key indicators so it can select the right scenario for achieving the greatest possible impact under the circumstances.\nIf unexpected circumstances arise suddenly, with little warning, leaders may choose to condense these steps, and design and implement contingency plans right away rather than waiting for additional triggers.\nWhat If?

Strategic planning is vital because it aligns the organization's vision, mission and goals. According to \"Strategic Planning for Dummies\" by Patricia Olsen: \"A strategic plan is a management tool that serves the purpose of helping an organization do a better job, because a plan focuses the energy, resources and time of everyone in the organization in the same direction.\"\n\"A strategic plan is a formalized roadmap that describes how your company executes the chosen strategy,\" according to Olsen. Oftentimes, business plans and strategic plans are mistaken for one another. Though similar guidelines may be at use, a business plan and a strategic plan are two different concepts for two different purposes. A business plan is for a business startup, whereas, a strategic plan is for established businesses and owners aiming for organizational expansion and growth.\nStrategic Planning Framework\nThree basic components for strategic planning exist, according to Olsen. First, ask where you are you now. Review the organization's present position and clarify mission statements, vision statements and values. Second, ask where you are going. Define the organization's competitive advantage, which helps clarify the direction the organization is headed into its future. Clarify what you are best at. Establish which advantages your organization has over the industry competition. Third, ask how you will you get there. Figure out where you are going by applying goal-setting theory and other necessary tools as active steps toward success.\nCreate a mission statement. A mission statement establishes the organization's core purpose. According to Mind Tools, begin the mission statement by identifying the organization's \"winning idea.\" Decide what stands out in your organization from other competitors, identify your basic measures of success, develop a quantitative goal and make sure your mission statement is both clear and concise.\nDecide your values statement by defining what your organization believes in and stands for. A values statement reveals that the organization is ethical and socially responsible. Like the mission statement, the values statement is clear and concise.\nDesired Future Position\nDevelop an all-encompassing vision statement. Unlike a mission statement, a vision statement explains where the organization is headed. Ask what your organization will look like five to 10 years into the future. A vision statement is a combination of an organization's mission and values that energizes people both within and outside of the organization.\nHow to Get There\nUse a SWOT analysis. This is a strategic planning tool that assesses Strengths (S), Weaknesses (W), Opportunities (O) and Threats (T). Start a SWOT analysis by listing corresponding traits below each word in the acronym.\nSet goals and create an action plan. Establish goals that are quantitative and challenging. Goals are the end result. A comprehensive action plan comprises goals that are broken down into minigoals that help you achieve your objectives.\nEstablish feedback along the way to measure and manage a strategic plan. Implement performance measures to track and monitor goal achievement during or after the strategic planning process.\nAssess your budget. Decide if your strategic plan has a sound budget.\nWatch out for strategic planning pitfalls. Strategic planning commonly fails because of lack of ownership. All your members need to feel empowered by taking part in the strategic planning process. When people do not have a stake or do not feel a sense of responsibility, this could lead to failure.

{"question":"How does the mechanism of categorical perception influence the way individuals with different English dialects interpret vowel sounds?","answer":"Categorical perception affects how people with different dialects interpret vowel sounds by making them associate the same sounds with different vowels based on their personal experiences. For example, in Australian English versus British English, the same sound /baɪt/ would be associated with 'bait' in Melbourne but with 'bite' in Newcastle. This is because our brain categorizes speech sounds into a relatively small set of perceptual experiences, drawing boundaries between these categories based on our prior linguistic exposure.","context":["Dutch people are tall. How do we know that? Luckily, we have millions of copies of the universal Metre (registered at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures). We can easily look at the world population statistics and decide who is above or below the average. In daily life, we are less precise and still able to discern who is tall and who is not. We do it based on the experience and continuous comparison with the other humans around. Depending on whether you grew up in the Netherlands or in Thailand, the experience changes and it is likely that a Dutch would judge someone being short who appears tall to a Bangkokian\nTake another example: the English words “bite” and “bait”. A British and an Australian speaker would disagree with each other about the correct pronunciation. Also, they would understand a different word when listening to a particular utterance: the sound /baɪt/ (phonetic notation) would be associated to “bite” in Newcastle and to “bait” in Melbourne. These differences are subtle, but we can run psycholinguistic experiments to question if these are just sporadic cases or hint to some general qualities of human language. Indeed, British and Australian researchers in collaboration carried an experiment about vowels with made-up words and proved that people with different English-speaking dialects associated the same sounds with different vowels. A notorious example is the vowel in “bath”, that is pronounced like “palm” in Australian English and like “trap” in British English.\nWhy do people with different accents hear different vowels when listening to the same recording of a sound? In general, our decisions are guided by our personal experiences.This is a useful strategy that our brain uses to integrate the missing pieces when the sensorial information is uncertain. Psychologists shed light on this intriguing aspect of humans and discovered that the general strategy humans use is to make categories: although most natural phenomena spread across a continuous spectrum, we categorize them in a relatively small set of possible perceptual experiences. We draw boundaries between these categories and we will associate an experience to a category all the times it falls in that perceptual realm. An everyday example is the rainbow: all the colours of the visible light spectrum are there, but we “see” only seven of them. This system of categorizing perceptual differences is very effective in making sense to a world with an infinite number of experiences.\nOur tendency to categorize the speech sounds we listen to was scientifically reported for the first time in 1957 by Liberman under the name of Categorical Perception. This opened an infinity of other questions, such as what are these categories? And (how) do they change upon experience? Unfortunately, only a few answers have come since then. The first complication concerns understanding what a speech-sound category is. The most accredited speech-sound categorization system in linguistics is based on phonemes, but in recent years, researchers in the psychology of language proved that speakers pay more attention to another system of differences, called allophones. A phoneme is the most simple unit that allows two words to be distinguishable while an allophone is one of multiple possible spoken sounds used to pronounce a phoneme, in a particular language. For example the phoneme /t/ distinguishes top from pop, and it has two allophones in English, the aspirated [t] as in top or the unaspirated one as in stop. Luckily, our understanding of the human language and brain is still on-going and there is yet much to discover; we cannot rule-out that multiple category schemes are at play together in between our ears.\nRegardless of the specific speech-sound categorization system at play in our brain, it is demonstrated that we use the categories to make decisions about what we heard. But how does this work? Kleinschmidt and Jaeger propose that humans are optimal listeners that profit from all their knowledge to understand each other. They suggest that when we deal with known speakers, like our friends or family, we will be facilitated in understanding their spoken words because we already know the sounds they will use to pronounce certain words, in a certain context. If we do not (yet) know the speaker well and have no prior experience with them that help us understand their utterances, we will soon get used to their particular accent by adapting our perceptual categories to them. McQueen and colleagues showed that the adaptation happens rapidly and that to reach it we use all the information available, like known words and facial expression. From then on, it will become easier to process the specific accent of that specific person. Figure 1 shows a simple animation to illustrate how a listener could adapt their vowel boundaries when speaking with their friends: Amelia from Newcastle, and Michael from Melbourne. The categories boundaries are there to evidence the variations in the vowel sounds across the two dialects and stress the division of a continuous acoustic space in few linguistic signs.\nIn conclusion, vowels, much like tall and short, are not good categories to draw set boundaries because they are not objective measures. Even if they are described with physical quantities, like centimeters or sound frequencies, our personal experience shapes perception to the point that our categories differ entirely from someone else’s.\n– Best CT, Shaw JA, Docherty G, Evans BG, Foulkes P, Hay J, et al.

{"question":"What's the difference between the initial planning stages of business continuity management and software development lifecycles? Like, how do they kick off their processes?","answer":"Business Continuity Management and Software Development lifecycles begin quite differently. BCM starts with obtaining top management's commitment and creating a policy that will guide the entire project, followed by communicating this policy to all stakeholders including vendors. In contrast, the software development lifecycle begins with requirements gathering, where the development team interacts with stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations, conducting interviews, workshops, and surveys to collect information. The initial phase of BCM focuses on establishing authority and policy, while software development emphasizes understanding user needs and documenting requirements.","context":["There isn't a day which goes by, when we aren't concerned about things such as market share, branding, competitive intelligence, revenue streams, supply chain efficiencies and human capital. But what tops all these issues is a question that underlies all our concerns at a fundamental level: How do we keep our business running in the face of things like:\n- Strict legislative mandates and/or regulatory requirements?\n- A deadly computer virus that can bring the network down?\n- Two cyclones in one year?\n- All commercial air traffic being grounded for 72 hours?\n- The actions of a disgruntled employee?\n- Absenteeism due to an epidemic?\nA well-thought-out business continuity management (BCM) plan is the answer which will help to keep a company moving in such unforeseen circumstances. Basically, the business continuity management lifecycle has six phases to it: program management, understanding the organization, determining the BCM strategy, developing and implementing a BCM response, exercising the response, as well as maintaining, reviewing and embedding BCM in the organization's culture. Here are the six steps of a business continuity management lifecycle. Awareness and training should happen at each and every stage.\nStep 1: Since BCM is crucial, it should have the top management's nod. Therefore, the first step in any business continuity management lifecycle is to get the top management's commitment. A policy has to be created since the entire project will be executed by them.\nStep 2: The next step in the business continuity management lifecycle is to communicate this policy to all key stakeholders including vendors and outsourced parties.\nStep 3: Identify a BCM sponsor who has the authority to implement business continuity management as per the policy. He can have a team and formulate a framework which covers activities identified under the BCM software's scope. Under the scope of BCM service, key products and services have to be identified. Additionally, the BCM objective should be aligned with the organizational objective. This should include the acceptable level of risk, as well as legal, regulatory and contractual obligations in order to meet the interests of the stakeholders.\nStep 4:The next step to follow in the business continuity management lifecycle is to analyze the basic impact to identify critical functions under the scope of BCM and carry out a risk assessment of those critical functions. After this, depending on the results, you have to look at alternative responses and recovery strategies. This should be followed by putting in place an incident management plan with an incident response structure. This should be followed by a business recovery plan and a disaster recovery plan. Implementing these plans is the next phase.\nStep 5: After implementing all the above plans, create an exercise program to cover different plans in line with the plans' objectives, review the plans, and ascertain their limitations or gaps. Update these plans based on any gaps.\nStep 6: The next step in the business continuity management lifecycle is to carry out the plan-do-check-act cycle. This includes managing the program through periodic management review, internal audits and self-assessments; embedding the BCM culture; carrying out exercises; and carrying out preventive and corrective actions to show continual improvement.\nIn today's competitive economy, customers are becoming increasingly intolerant of lapses in service. As more business gets outsourced to other countries, organizations which continue to deliver services at the agreed levels (continuity) and without fail (repeatability) will continue to thrive.\nFollowing the business continuity management lifecycle is a sure-shot solution for organizations to continue delivering their key products and services during a disaster—and surviving thereafter.\nAbout the author: R Vaidhyanathan is vice president and head of BCM practice at the Business Continuity Management Institute.

The Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) encompasses these steps and provides a structured approach to ensure the success of software development projects. In this article, we will explore the key steps in the SDLC, the role of coding languages, the importance of choosing the right software development company, and more.\nThe field of software development has seen tremendous growth in recent years. As technology continues to evolve, businesses rely on software applications to streamline their operations, enhance productivity, and deliver value to their customers. However, developing software is not a straightforward task. It requires careful planning, collaboration, and adherence to established methodologies. This is where the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) comes into play.\nUnderstanding the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)\nDefinition of SDLC\nThe Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) is a structured approach to software development that defines the processes and activities involved in creating, deploying, and maintaining software applications. It provides a framework for development teams to work systematically, ensuring that the end product meets the desired requirements and quality standards.\nImportance of SDLC\nThe SDLC is crucial for successful software development projects. It helps in reducing risks, improving efficiency, and enhancing the overall quality of the software. By following a well-defined process, development teams can identify and address issues at each stage, leading to more reliable and robust software applications.\nPhases of the Software Development Lifecycle\nThe SDLC consists of several distinct phases, each serving a specific purpose in the software development process. While the exact number and naming of these phases may vary depending on the methodology used, the core phases remain consistent across different approaches. Let's explore each phase in detail:\nThe first phase of the SDLC is requirements gathering. During this phase, the development team interacts with stakeholders to understand their needs and expectations from the software. The primary goal is to gather detailed and comprehensive requirements that will serve as the foundation for the development process.\nGathering user requirements\nThe development team engages with users, clients, and other stakeholders to identify their needs, challenges, and desired functionalities. This involves conducting interviews, workshops, and surveys to gather relevant information.\nAnalyzing and documenting requirements\nOnce the requirements are gathered, they are analyzed to ensure clarity, completeness, and feasibility. The team then documents these requirements in a detailed specification document, which serves as a reference for the subsequent phases.\nThe system design phase involves transforming the gathered requirements into a detailed architectural blueprint. This phase defines how the software will be structured, how different components will interact with each other, and how data will be stored and accessed.\nThe development team designs the overall architecture of the software, including the choice of technologies, frameworks, and platforms. This ensures that the software is scalable, maintainable, and meets the desired performance requirements.\nDuring this stage, the team designs the database structure that will store and organize the application's data. They determine the relationships between different data entities and create an efficient and secure database schema.\nUser interface design\nThe user interface design focuses on creating an intuitive and user-friendly interface for the software. The team considers factors such as usability, accessibility, and visual aesthetics to design a compelling user experience.\nCoding and Implementation\nThe coding and implementation phase involves translating the system design into actual code. This is where the development team brings the software to life by writing program code using selected coding languages.\nSelecting coding languages\nThe development team writes the code according to the requirements and design specifications. They follow coding standards and best practices to ensure code quality, readability, and maintainability. Additionally, they leverage software development tools and frameworks to streamline the coding process.\nConducting code reviews\nCode reviews play a crucial role in ensuring code quality and identifying potential issues early on. The team conducts thorough code reviews, where other team members review and provide feedback on the code. This helps in catching bugs, improving code efficiency, and maintaining coding standards.\nTesting and Quality Assurance\nThe testing and quality assurance phase is vital to validate the software's functionality, performance, and reliability. This phase involves various testing techniques and processes to identify and resolve any defects or issues before the software is deployed.\nTypes of testing\nDifferent types of testing are performed during this phase, including unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and user acceptance testing. Each type focuses on specific aspects of the software and helps ensure that it performs as expected.\nTest plan creation\nA comprehensive test plan is created to outline the testing activities, test cases, and test scenarios. This plan serves as a guide for the testing team and ensures that all the necessary aspects of the software are thoroughly tested.\nBug tracking and fixing\nDuring testing, defects or bugs may be identified. These issues are logged, tracked, and assigned to the development team for resolution. The team fixes the bugs and performs regression testing to ensure that the fixes do not introduce new issues.\nThe deployment phase involves preparing the software for release and making it available to users or clients. This includes installation, configuration, and training to ensure a smooth transition from development to production.\nInstallation and configuration\nThe software is installed on the target systems, and any necessary configurations are performed. This may involve setting up databases, configuring servers, and integrating with other software or systems.\nIf required, the software development company team provides training sessions to users or clients to familiarize them with the software's features and functionalities. This helps ensure a successful adoption of the software and maximizes its benefits."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:cf11a3d9-9797-4728-8e29-22914fef9974>","<urn:uuid:750f3581-a24b-4579-80ed-26f420b45361>"],"error":null}
{"question":"When comparing the impacts of climate change on Arctic sea ice between past observations and future projections, what are the key differences? For instance, how does the historical 40% thinning compare to projected future scenarios? 📊","answer":"Arctic sea ice has already thinned by 40% in recent years. Looking to the future, the situation is expected to become even more severe, with predictions indicating that the Arctic Ocean could be largely free of sea ice during summer as early as 2030 or even before that. While these changes will continue until 2050, they could potentially be stabilized after that if substantial cuts to greenhouse gas emissions, like those in the Paris climate agreement, are implemented.","context":["You must have noticed the signs. Longer, hotter summers. Shorter, milder winters. Birds arriving on their breeding grounds weeks before they once did.\nSo, why not just enjoy the weather? Because what seems like a change for the better is really a cause for grave concern. Today, the Earth is heating up faster than at any other time in 10,000 years. The reason is the greenhouse effect. Just as a greenhouse captures the sun’s warmth, greenhouse gases trap heat in the Earth’s atmosphere. When we burn coal, oil, and natural gas to fuel factories, communities, and automobiles, we add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. Since the start of the Industrial Revolution in the early 1700s, greenhouse gas concentrations have risen sharply: carbon dioxide (CO2) by 30 per cent, nitrous oxide by 15 per cent, and methane by 100 per cent. These increases heighten the greenhouse effect, raising global temperatures and causing the planet’s climate to change.\nThat is why extreme weather events, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, and radical swings between deluge and drought, are becoming more common. Polar ice caps are shrinking. Mountain glaciers are melting. Sea levels are rising. Lake levels are falling. Meanwhile, biological impacts of climate change are becoming more evident. Many species are relocating, migrating sooner, and bearing young earlier than in the past. Fish from southern waters, like great white sharks and Pacific blue marlin, are appearing more frequently off Canada’s coasts. Coral reefs worldwide are dying off. Amphibians are declining globally. Entire ecosystems are shifting and wildlife habitats vanishing. The most dramatic changes of all are taking place in Canada’s Arctic, which is heating up faster than anywhere else. Here, northerners are watching in disbelief as the permafrost melts beneath their feet, Pacific salmon are caught for the first time, and sea ice shrinks away from the coast.\nWhile the science of climate change is still evolving, most experts predict a dramatic shift in environmental conditions worldwide. Scientists anticipate that CO2 concentrations will triple by the end of this century. By 2100, average global temperatures could rise by 1.5 to 4.5°C. In some parts of Canada, temperatures may increase by 5 to 10°C. This rapid warming of our oceans and atmosphere could result in climatic changes greater than humans have ever seen.\nTo determine which regions are at risk and how, experts use computer-generated global circulation models. These models show that aquatic ecosystems are especially vulnerable because of their limited ability to adapt to climatic changes and that, as a northern nation with a longer coastline and more freshwater than any other country, Canada may be among the hardest hit. What else do they forecast?\n- As temperatures rise, ocean waters may expand and polar ice caps, glaciers, and sea ice could melt faster than before, raising sea levels by up to one metre, causing higher tides, submerging islands, eroding shorelines, flooding coastal wetlands, and polluting ground and surface waters.\n- Extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, typhoons, and tornadoes, may happen more often, with more severe impacts on coastal and inland areas.\n- Rain and snow could increase in some regions like the Great Lakes but decrease in others like the Prairies.\n- Increasing cycles of drought and flood may stress freshwater resources, lower river and lake levels, and make it harder to cultivate crops.\n- Higher water temperatures could change the course and intensity of major ocean currents, disrupting entire ecosystems, and altering the dispersion of nutrients and warmth that sustain marine life.\nWildlife in Hot Water\nClimate change could mean troubled times ahead for an untold diversity of aquatic life, from the equator to the ends of the Earth:\n- The fate of countless plants and animals may depend on their ability to move from unfavourable climatic conditions to ones that meet their survival needs. Those that are endangered, slow moving, or isolated in fragmented areas could find themselves stranded.\n- Migrators whose arrival and departure dates are no longer in sync with the rhythms of nature could miss the food sources they need to survive, the warm weather they need to breed, and the wind and ocean currents they need to travel.\n- Changing distributions, migration patterns, and growth rates of salmon, cod, and herring may disrupt commercial fisheries.\n- Heavier rainfall in coastal regions could result in more polluted run-off entering estuaries and bays, which provide food and shelter for fish and shellfish and are important stopovers for migratory birds.\n“The time has come,” the walrus said, “to talk of many things…”\nOne of the things the walrus talks about in Lewis Carroll’s poem is “why the sea is boiling hot.” Nowadays, warmer seas may well be a topic of conversation among walruses lounging on ice floes in Canada’s Arctic. The many grunts, growls, barks, and bellows emitted by these massive marine mammals could be their way of lamenting the loss of the habitat that gives them life.\nAmong the fastest-warming regions on Earth, the Arctic may face the worst impacts of climate change in the 21st century. Scientists predict the continued melting of sea ice: a vast, frozen platform that has already thinned by 40 per cent in recent years yet is indispensable to the survival of walruses, polar bears, king eiders, narwhals, and countless other creatures.\nRanging from Canada’s Eastern Arctic, down to James Bay and the Labrador coast, across the North Atlantic to the Kara Sea, the walrus is no longer found in the Northwest Atlantic, Mackenzie Delta, or St. Lawrence River. Its disappearance from these regions was the result not of climate change but of commercial hunting in the past. Remaining walrus populations have largely recovered in the Eastern Arctic and are now hunted only by indigenous people, who use every part of the animal’s body for food, carvings, hides for covering kayaks, and other practical purposes.\nThe walrus itself makes the most of nature’s gifts to eke out an existence. This one-tonne, two-tusked heap of wrinkles, blubber, and whiskers is perfectly adapted to survive in the Arctic seas, whether using its thick skin and folds of fat to withstand the frigid temperatures, diving to depths of up to 100 metres with the help of its powerful fins, or using its tusks to fend off polar bears or to dig for clams on the ocean floor. The question is whether the walrus can adapt to the challenges of climate change.\nWhat Is Being Done?\nClimate change is a global problem. All the world’s nations must work together to find solutions, especially heavily industrialized countries whose populations and greenhouse gas emissions are increasing rapidly. To meet this challenge, Canada supports international efforts aimed at minimizing quantities of greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere.\nAcross this country, governments, industries, schools, communities, and individuals are taking action to curb climate change and address its impacts. Their efforts include improving the management of aquatic and terrestrial habitats; supporting climate change and atmospheric research; increasing energy efficiency in buildings and automobiles; and developing renewable energy sources, such as wind turbines and solar power, as well as fuel cell technology.\nCan You Help Turn Down the Heat?\nGet informed about climate change and its impacts on aquatic wildlife and habitat. Then, undertake ocean action projects, conserving food, water, shelter, and space for species threatened by climate change. Choose projects that protect the natural ability of terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems to absorb greenhouse gases and maintain a healthy climate; that help isolated species meet their needs by improving connectivity between fragmented habitats; and that buffer the impacts of climate change on marine habitats.\nDo everything you can to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by encouraging energy efficiency and promoting non-polluting energy sources at home, at school, and in your community. Contact public officials and urge them to develop and strengthen programs to encourage energy efficiency and renewable energy; raise fuel economy standards for cars and trucks; set strict limits on greenhouse gas emissions from power plants; improve efficiency standards for electronics and home appliances; and ensure the sound management of marine ecosystems.\nCelebrate Oceans Day!\nYou and your community can commemorate Oceans Day in many ways:\n- Create an Oceans Day display addressing climate change or another theme at your local library, school, or community centre.\n- Encourage family, friends, and neighbours to dispose of household hazardous wastes, such as batteries, motor oil, leftover paint, and solvent containers, at proper waste disposal sites rather than dumping them down the drain.\n- Link up with another community — coastal or inland — in a distant part of Canada or the world and collaborate on ocean awareness activities or action projects.\n- Recruit volunteers to clean up a beach, river, wetland, or coastal area through local media, posters displayed in community centres and schools, and by contacting youth groups.\n- Write letters to the editor of your local newspaper expressing your concerns about ocean health.\n- Circulate a petition voicing your concerns about climate change or another environmental problem and suggesting solutions; send the petition to the prime minister, a Member of Parliament, or other environmental decision-maker.\n- Prepare a news release or public service announcement describing your Oceans Day activities; submit it to a local newspaper or radio station.\n- Persuade your town council to officially declare Oceans Day, June 8, and implement ocean-action projects.\n© Canadian Wildlife Federation\nAll rights reserved.

In the fall of 2016 mean temperatures were six degrees higher than average.\n- Thawing permafrost that holds 50 per cent of the world's carbon is already affecting northern infrastructure and could release significant amounts of methane into the atmosphere.\n- Polar bears, walruses and seals that rely on ice for survival are facing increased stress and disruption.\n- Changes in the Arctic may be affecting weather as far away as Southeast Asia.\n\"The Arctic is connected to the rest of the planet,\" said David Barber, who is a leading expert on Arctic ice at the University of Manitoba and one of the authors of the report.\n- Human-influenced extreme weather felt across the globe: study\n- Climate change means more 'mild days' for Canada: study\n- Ancient methane 'burp' points to climate change 110 million years ago\n\"We are seeing the first and strongest signs of global warming in the Arctic. We knew this was coming, we knew 30 years ago that it was coming, and it is now here,\" said Barber in an interview with CBC News.\nOpen water during winter\nBarber said one of the most surprising results of the research is that there is now open water even during the winter in the Arctic Ocean.\n\"We didn't think we would see that much open water in the winter,\" he said adding that it is occurring mostly on the Atlantic side.\n\"The Atlantic ocean water is penetrating further into the Arctic and it's upwelling towards the base of the sea ice, where it is melting the sea ice from underneath, this is one of the key findings.\"\nLast year saw a record low amount of winter sea ice.\nThat open water may be affecting weather patterns. Increased heat from the open water is rising into the atmosphere, which in turn is causing the polar vortex, also known as the jet stream, to weaken in strength.\nThe jet stream is the line of powerful winds between the cold dry air of the North Pole and the warm moist air mass farther south. As it weakens, it disintegrates into a series of lobes dipping up and down, carrying cold air south and warm air north.\nScientists believe that's the reason why we are seeing unseasonably frigid temperatures in places like Florida and unusually warm weather in the north.\n\"For example, last fall in November-December, the temperature at the North Pole was 32 degrees Fahrenheit higher than it should have been in November-December, because one of these lobes had extended all the way to the North Pole and was drawing up warm weather from California,\" said Barber.\nThe report says the weakened jet stream is also causing extreme weather events like heavy rain in North America and heavy monsoons in Southeast Asia.\nAmid the dire predictions, the report contains some hope. It says that while these changes in the Arctic will continue until 2050, they can be slowed down after that.\nIt predicts that if governments make substantial cuts to greenhouse gas emissions, like those contained in the Paris climate agreement, it can help to stabilize the warming trends in the Arctic and stop further loss of ice and snow by the end of the century.\nThis report is being released ahead of the Arctic Council meeting in Fairbanks, Alaska, on May 11. The U.S. is hosting the meeting, which will be the first time that Arctic nations including the U.S., Canada, Russia, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden will gather to talk about climate change since Donald Trump was elected U.S. president.\nTrump has called climate change a Chinese hoax and his government is in the process of scrapping environmental measures designed to control carbon emissions linked to climate change.\nSnow, Water, Ice and Permafrost in the Arctic (PDF KB)\nSnow, Water, Ice and Permafrost in the Arctic (Text KB)CBC is not responsible for 3rd party content"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:043292e6-593f-4306-9570-1fa69a55f90c>","<urn:uuid:5531b55e-6d42-4510-b63d-3bc94c962209>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What role does cultural diplomacy play in India's relations with the West versus Indonesia?","answer":"India's cultural diplomacy takes different forms in these contexts. With the West, India aims to offer a counter-narrative to West-centric views of history and inter-state relations, highlighting its civilizational experience in creating harmony from diverse belief systems. This is exemplified in initiatives like the International Day of Yoga, which gained support from 177 UN member states. In contrast, with Indonesia, while there are shared cultural elements through ancient influences like the Ramayana, modern cultural connections are primarily through Bollywood, with Indonesian President Jokowi specifically noting the popularity of stars like Shah Rukh Khan and Kareena Kapoor. This shows how India's cultural diplomacy adapts to different contexts while maintaining its soft power approach.","context":["Continuity and change in India's Foreign Policy\nBy: Amb. (Retd.) Jitendra Nath Misra\nCentral University of Jharkhand, Ranchi\nDate: January 31, 2017\nIt is my great pleasure to speak to you to- day on continuity and change in India’s foreign policy. I would like to thank the Central University of Jharkhand and the Public Diplomacy Division of the Ministry of External Affairs for so generously hosting my visit to Ranchi for this lecture.\nWith the international system getting realigned, where does India stand? As power shifts in a crowded field, India competes with others for the status it seeks. History suggests that India’s aspirations are bound to collide with the privileges of existing world powers. An ascent on the global high table is never smooth.\nFor decades, India was treated as a middle- rung power. The expectation now is that India will likely become a major world power in the foreseeable future.\nWill it? Is India finding its true voice as a world power? What are its strengths? What are its strategic priorities and challenges?\nStrong growth and a vibrant democracy already aid India’s ascension. It is in soft power projection that India is doing catch up. India has launced a considerable charm offensive in recent years. Its’s diplomatic arsenal is getting more diverse.\nDo the present government’s moves to energise what I call \"the diplomacy of development” and put soft power at the centre of India’s diplomatic outreach mark a foreign policy departure?\nThe Indian policy community is divided on where the nation’s foreign policy is headed. Some argue that there has been a fundamental shift, whereas others opine that there is no basic departure from the past. The truth perhaps lies in between.\nI would argue that there is both continuity and change in foreign policy. Indeed, in some areas, there are elements of both continuity and change.\nIn the last few years there has been a high degree of continuity in foreign policy objectives: ensuring a peaceful, secure and stable neighbourhood; securing inward foreign investment, and increasing India’s influence.\nThere is a clear recognition that regional stability is essential for India’s development. This explains the presence of all the leaders of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation and Mauritius at Prime Minister Modi’s swearing in in May, 2014. With clear- headed pragmatism the government has reinforced the primacy of the neighbourhood and the Indian Ocean.\nContinuity and Change\nAt the bilateral level there is continuity and I daresay, even change, in policy towards the United States, China and Pakistan. Foreign policy does not change in sharp breaks with the past, but at a gradual pace.We need to see things as evolving.\nThere is a growing convergence of views between India and the U.S. on the security and diplomatic architecture of the Asia- Pacific. A joint statement issued during President Obama’s visit to India in January, 2015 stated:\n\"We affirm the importance of safeguarding maritime security and ensuring freedom of navigation and over flights throughout the region, especially the South China Sea.”\nThere were direct references to the South China Sea in the India- U.S. joint statement of September, 2014, and during Prime Minister Modi’s visits to Japan in 2014 and South Korea in 2015.\nThere is also a breakthrough in the implementation of the civil nuclear agreement of 2008. This is not a new policy, but the pace of developments is a departure from the past.\nA second ten-year defence framework agreement, providing for technology transfers and the co-production of arms in India, and the Logistics Exchange Memorandum of Agreement, have been concluded. The former agreement is an example of continuity, the latter an example of change.\nNow, I turn to the neighbourhood. With two nuclear-armed neighbours in occupation of its territory, India faces formidable security challenges, like no other nation on the planet. This is underappreciated, if not ignored, by the world’s foreign policy and strategic communities.\nNever in history did India have a great power like China on its borders. In the past, India has relied upon a combination of diplomacy and capacity- building to prevent strategic surprise. But the present government has demonstrated a greater firmness in dealing with China, while simutaneously seeking stronger business ties. As Prime Minister Modi said at the Raisina Dialogue 2017: \"both our countries need to show sensitivity and respect for each other’s core concerns and interests.”\nThus, India deals with China with confidence and candour. This is the new normal in the relationship. India and China engage, cooperate and compete simultaneously. Even as China has become India’s largest trading partner, India has not lost sight of the issues of contention. Boundary negotiations have reached a point where political will on both sides is required for a solution. The two countries need to be mindful of the strategic aspect of the relationship, and recognise that their rise can be mutually supportive.\nThe simultaneous rise of China and India as major world economies is a new factor in the international system. The fact that China is ahead of India shapes India’s positions towards its northern neighbour. India sometimes has to concede to China in pragmatic side- stepping. For example, the Asia Industrial Investment Bank and the New Development Bank of BRICS are headquartered in Beijing and Shanghai, not in New Delhi or Mumbai, because China is the stronger economy. Yet, while China remains a challenge, it is also a partner in the transformation of India.\nIndia’s complex relationship with Pakistan has swung from dialogue to crisis. The issues bedevelling the relationship are far from solution. With the strategic balance slowly shifting in India’s favour, Pakistan has engaged in sub-conventional and asymmetric warfare. Since the 1990s, Pakistan has adopted terrorism as policy, yet India has seen economic ascension in this period.\nWith the internal problems Pakistan faces, India has poor policy options. Neither dialogue nor its suspension have worked, so India is intent on managing the relationship, and preventing problems from spilling over. In such a strategic advance- retreat setting, the government has been firm on bottom lines, but has also engaged Pakistan.\nAt one level, under the present government, we witnessed a change in Pakistan policy. By engaging Pakistan, the government reversed the suspension of official- level talks in January, 2013 by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, following ceasefire violations across the line of control in Jammu and Kashmir. Prime Minister Modi and Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif held talks at Prime Minister Modi’s inauguration in New Delhi in May, 2014, and on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organisation summit in Ufa, in 2015. In another policy reversal, back- to- back \"talks on terror” - led by the two National Security Advisors – and talks between the two Foreign Secretaries on all other issues, including Kashmir, were announced.\nBut soon enough terrorism began to cast its familiar shadow over the relationship. Following differences on the agenda and programme for the Pakistani National Security Advisor’s visit, planned talks between the foreign secretaries and national security advisors were not held in 2014 and 2015. India made talks contingent upon an end to terrorism.\nFor the government, terrorism remains the core issue. Lashkar e Tayabba chief Hafiz Mohammed Saeed remains free, with a specious claim to heading a charitable organization. Despite suspected links to the Pathankot terror attack, Jaish e Mohammed chief Maulana Masood Azhar is free. Zakiur- Rehman Lakhvi, Lashkar e Tayabba’s Chief of Operations, and the prime accused in the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, was released on bail after spending six years in prison, on the ground of lack of evidence provided by India, something India disputes.\nYet, the government did not shy away from dialogue. In December, 2015, official- level talks were held at Bangkok. External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj visited Islamabad in December, 2015, and a Comprehensive Bilateral Dialogue was announced. Prime Minister Modi visited Lahore to greet Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on his birthday the same month. Following a pause after the Pathankot terror attack, Foreign Secretary talks were held in April, 2016. The two national security advisors maintained contact, and the chiefs of the two border forces met to calm border tension.\nAt present, following the Uri terror attacks, dialogue remains suspended. But given the fraught history with Pakistan, India will continue to search for solutions to issues with Pakistan.\nThus, broadly, there are elements of continuity and change in the government’s policy towards Pakistan.\nAn example of both continuity and change in policy is the resolution of the land boundary dispute with Bangladesh, which had eluded solution since 1971. This was a pre- emptive good- neighbourly act. For sure, previous governments had taken steps for resolution of the land boundary dispute, but the present government has been decisive in taking the new approach forward. It showed similar reflexes in resolving a maritime dispute with Bangladesh.\nAt the regional level there has been vigour in taking forward initiatives in the Asia Pacific. This marks change, amid continuity.\nThe Asia Pacific\nThe government has pursued a strong Indian Ocean policy, as well as combating maritime terrorism. In March, 2015, after decades, India unveiled a vision framework for the Indian Ocean. Going beyond the former government’s policy of being a \"net security provider” to Indian Ocean island states, the Indian Navy has released a revised maritime security strategy, Ensuring Secure Seas: Indian Maritime Security Strategy. The government has announced a new initiative, SAGAR- Security And Growth for All in the Region- not only to safeguard India and its island territories, but to broaden economic and security cooperation in the region.\nAt the global level, there is both continuity and change in the economic realm.\nThe Diplomacy of Development\nEnlisting foreign partners for India’s development has been at the core of India’s foreign policy since independence. After the economic reforms of 1991, this was pursued with vigour. Under the present government, the process has been further energized. There is continuity in policy, and change in the vigour with which it is being pursued.\nAt his election in 2014, Prime Minister Modi announced the goal of 8.5 per cent economic growth. In the year ending March, 2016 the Indian economy grew by 7.3 per cent. Over the next decade the government hopes to raise the share of manufacturing in the GDP from 17 to 25 per cent. Foreign policy is an enabler in the process.\nIn recent years the government has sought billons of dollars in investments in manufacturing and infrastructure, notably from the U.K., Germany, France, Japan and the UAE. The government has coupled diplomacy and development in a turn towards quantifiable outcomes. Prime Minister Modi’s foreign visits have focussed on the search for technology, resources and best practice.\nAnother example of continuity and change all at once is culture. The government has brought the tenets and symbols of India’s culture into the centre of India’s diplomatic outreach. This is a continuation of India’s charm offensive in recent years through its soft power approach to win friends across the world.\nIndia has always played a major role in international affairs, offering a range of ideas and interventions in the cultural and political domain. There is a need to integrate New Delhi’s natural soft power aspects into its external interface. By harnessing such cultural resources, the government has reached out to the larger world.\nBut this soft power narration is also an alternate view of the world, aimed at the international community. The government wants to offer a counter- narrative to the West- centric view of history and inter- state relations. With thousands of years of experience in creating a civilisation out of diverse belief systems, India is a beacon light. The government has seized upon this idea to project a cultural narrative.\nThe best example of India’s harnessing of soft power to achieve diplomatic objectives is the commemoration of the first ever International Day of Yoga. With breath- taking speed the government got 177 of the 193 member states of the United Nations to co- sponsor a resolution in the United Nations General Assembly in September, 2014 on commemorating the International Day of Yoga on June 21. The other example is the promotion of Nalanda University as an international partnership.\nIt is not as if indigenous traditions were not put at the disposal of India’s foreign policy mandarins in the past. But what is new is the sustained focus on this.\nI now turn to change, at the global, regional and bilateral levels.\nAt the global level, we see a shift towards playing a leading world role, rather than a mere balancing one, with ambition, energy and confidence.\nThere is a realisation in the government that, to become a true great power, India will need to set the agenda on the burning international issues of the day, rather than merely shaping outcomes. At the end of the Second World War India was a passive witness to the creation of a new security architecture for the world, as decisions concerning India were made by the British. But India now is prepared to lead the negotiation of global covenants.\nI shall illustrate examples.\nIndia is willing to shoulder the responsibility of securing the global commons. This was demonstrated by humanitarian relief operations in Yemen, Nepal, South Sudan, Fiji, Sri Lanka and the Maldives, and in India’s continuing lead in UN peacekeeping operations. India stood in the frontlines in keeping the maritime commons safe and secure, and in global negotiations, such as on climate change.\nWe are seeing a policy framework that radiates India’s diplomatic influence beyond it’s neighbourhood. In 2015 alone Prime Minister Modi made 28 foreign visits. This shows that India thinks globally, and Indian leaders travel accordingly.\nThere is a change at the regional level as well.\nAct East Policy\nDuring colonial rule, India’s links with the East were disrupted. At independence, India leaned on the West for nation- building. Asia took a back seat as the West became the main source of technology and capital. With the end of the Cold War, India again shifted its gaze to the East, drawing from the rich ties of history. It began to search for new partnerships with a rising East, led by China. The outcome was the Look East Policy. The evolution of the Look East Policy to the Act East Policy is a shift from conception to outcomes.\nLet us turn to the bilateral level, where we see significant changes.\nIn January, 2016, India made a modest supply of three MI 25 ground attack helicoptors to Afghanistan. This is not a force multiplier, but marks a change in policy.\nThere has been a modification in India’s policy towards Israel. In a policy departure on the conflict in Gaza, which resumed in July, 2014, the government took a neutral position, calling for peace talks. In another departure, India abstained from voting on an application by a Palestinian non- governmental organization for special consultative status in a UN committee. It abstained on a UN Human Rights Commission resolution that condemned Israel over a July, 2014 UN report on violence in Gaza.\nIn September, 2014 Prime Minister Modi and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met on the margins of the UN General Assembly at New York. The first visit of an Israeli defence minister to India took place in February, 2015. While in the past India had avoided high- level visits to Israel, President Pranab Mukherjee visited Israel in October, 2015.\nThe fact that India’s foreign and security policies are ‘enablers’ in the transformation of India is now well understood among thinking Indians. In that sense, by getting tied to domestic policy, which receives greater public attention, foreign policy has woven itself into the people’s consciousness.\nIndia is being recast. At Partition, the Indian state was weak. Strategic thinking was thus security- oriented, with an avoidance of entanglements, to protect the borders. To- day India is at the centre of the international security architecture, and key to the economic and technological debates of the age. By virtue of its economic growth, its world- class space programme, and its contributions from medicine to IT, India has become indispensable to global needs and a shaper of the world economy, not just as a market, but also as an engine of growth and ideas.\nIt would thus not be far- fetched to say that what India does will profoundly affect the future of the world. Terrorism is an example. With swathes of embittered humanity on the boil, terrorism is at the centre of international discourse. The world now speaks of 9/11 and 26/11 in the same breath, and, as a major victim, India becomes a natural partner in fighting terrorism. Similarly, on the emission of greenhouse gases and climate change, what India does affects the world. This is the foundation for India’s new foreign policy.\nThank you for the honour accorded me.","Political leaders, officials and academics alike tend to portray India and Indonesia as “natural partners”. Most of them also recognise that in contemporary times, the relationship has not been progressing to its full potential. The visit to India by President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Jokowi, reflects both recognition of this reality and the two nations’ shared desire for course correction. It has produced a reasonable outcome, fuelling optimism about the future.\nAs two of the world’s populous countries, Asian democracies committed to pluralism, close maritime neighbours, and emerging economies with strong complementarities, India and Indonesia have much in common.\nToday, in Jokowi and Narendra Modi, they also have leaders who enjoy mass appeal and grassroots support, although at their meeting this week each may be preoccupied with domestic worries. In personal terms they share much, besides their humble origins.\nBoth served at provincial levels before entering national politics. One loves rock music, the other can play drums. Both prefer to dress informally. Perhaps in a subtle Javanese manner, the visiting president paid a handsome compliment to the Indian PM when he revealed his grandson’s name – Srinarendra. Its meaning, he said, is “a wise leader”.\nWhat, of course, matters more for inter-state relations is an objective assessment of their respective national interests. From this realistic perspective, the evolving geopolitics of East Asia seems to be driving the two nations to a closer embrace. The rise and behaviour of China, uncertainties about Asian policies of Trump’s America, and serious fissures within Asean have all impelled Delhi and Jakarta towards a new realisation: a stronger bilateral relationship and greater coordination in regional and global affairs would serve their mutual interests better.\nIndonesian sources indicated that good personal chemistry between the two leaders was clearly visible during their dialogue on Monday. First, they agreed to hold annual summit meetings, including on the margin of multilateral events. Second, the two governments have committed themselves to consolidate security and defence cooperation. Existing arrangements will be upgraded. Specifically on terrorism, a “zero tolerance” policy against acts of terror will be followed.\nThird, trade and economic cooperation will be pushed through agreed measures. Investments in IT, pharma and infrastructure seem quite appealing. Indonesian companies would need a lot of access, encouragement and support from Indian authorities and corporate leaders before they commit to enter the Indian market.\nIndian investment in Indonesia, valued at $15 billion, shows considerable scope for expansion. Fourth, cooperation possibilities by deepening ties at people-to-people level through expansion of exchanges in education, entertainment, arts and tourism, were stressed. The launch of Jakarta-Mumbai flight by Garuda Airlines, Indonesia’s national carrier, coinciding with Jokowi’s visit, is a welcome development.\nFinally, the maritime dimension of India-Indonesia strategic partnership was highlighted through a separate statement, as was done earlier in the case of US, Japan and Australia. Jokowi’s doctrine of Indonesia as “maritime axis” and Modi’s Indian Ocean policy of SAGAR (Security and Growth for All in the Region) have set the stage for enhanced cooperation as a means to cope with both traditional and non-traditional threats to security. As their cooperative mechanisms gain strength, the two nations could become vital pillars of stability in the Indo-Pacific region.\nAmidst a plethora of agreements, a significant difference should also be pointed out. The Indian state and academia routinely rely on shared history and legacy of the Ramayana, Borobudur, Bali and Batik to emphasise India’s affinity with Indonesia. President Jokowi conceded that for centuries Indonesia had “felt India’s influence through its language and culture”. But, in his banquet remarks he notably added that at present the Indian influence could “also” be felt through Bollywood. He referred to Shah Rukh Khan, Kareena Kapoor and Aishwarya Rai as popular stars in Indonesia.\nAs the visiting president hailed the Indian film ‘Kuch Kuch Hota Hai’, the Rashtrapati Bhavan orchestra played the film’s title song, giving much delight to Indonesian guests. Civilisational siblings are on the road of mutual re-discovery."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:10208085-3429-42e3-b7e2-556dcbbab32f>","<urn:uuid:f2a67720-6c03-4cc5-aa07-437a27036c0a>"],"error":null}

{"question":"What advantages do Arup's circular building and Landia's GasMix system demonstrate in terms of maintenance and component accessibility?","answer":"Both Arup's circular building and Landia's GasMix system prioritize ease of maintenance and accessibility, but through different approaches. Arup's building was specifically designed for disassembly, using non-toxic and pre-fabricated components that can be easily taken apart. They implemented a BIM system where all items, from window frames to individual fittings, were tagged with unique QR codes containing information needed for reuse and maintenance. Landia's GasMix system, installed at Eco Sustainable Solutions, places all pumps and pipe-work parts on the outside of the digesters, allowing for maintenance without interrupting the 24/7 process. This external mounting has proven highly reliable and practical, eliminating the need to access internal components and significantly reducing health and safety risks compared to traditional submerged equipment.","context":["Arup’s circular building project, launched in September 2016, used technology to maximise utilisation of components and materials. Arup designed the building for disassembly, using non-toxic and pre-fabricated components that can easily be taken apart.\nArup applied BIM to enable the building to function as a material bank. The 3D BIM model for the building provided transparency into building material composition, and digital technology tagged all items, from window frames to individual fittings, each with a unique QR code containing information needed for reuse.\nThis improved access to information helped multiple stakeholders collaborate more efficiently on building design, construction, and operation and enabled Arup to contract with suppliers to take back materials after their use.\nThe Indira Paryavaran Bhavan office building houses the Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change (MoEFCC) on seven floors in New Delhi. The building, reportedly the first net zero building in India, has achieved net zero energy consumption through a two-pronged approach – minimising energy demand and meeting the demand with renewable energy.\nBuilding design features minimise energy and water consumption for total energy savings of 40% and water savings of 55%. The building has the largest rooftop solar system among multi-story buildings in India, with an installed capacity of 930 kW peak solar power supplying the total energy needed by the building.\nThe configuration and orientation of the building optimise ventilation by separating blocks with connecting corridors built around a large central courtyard. Chilled beam air conditioning reduces energy consumption by 40%, compared with a conventional system, by cooling the air via water in pipes throughout the ceiling. Energy-efficient lighting further reduces energy consumption, and even the passenger elevators generate energy during use.\nWater-efficient fittings, rainwater capture, and the reuse of treated water for plant irrigation and cooling systems reduce water demand. Sewage is treated on site and the resulting clean water irrigates vegetation around the building, meaning that no water escapes from the site.\nRedesigning the urban metabolism encourages cities to invest in effective water management solutions that close water, food, nutrient, and energy loops while delivering social benefits. Biopolus offers an integrated network of water treatment facilities (metabolic hubs) in aesthetically appealing multi-functional buildings that can provide sanitation solutions for informal settlements, luxury residential communities, and industrial parks alike.\nEach hub can serve 5,000-50,000+ people. The hubs use innovative Metabolic Network Reactor (MNR) technology in a controlled, bio-engineered process to tailor water output for specific uses, including irrigation, industrial processes, and potable water.\nThe hubs occupy as much as 60% less land, save up to 35% on operating cost compared with traditional solutions, and can be installed with minimal disruption to local residents. The hubs can be designed in modules to provide functions of the community’s choosing, such as water reuse, energy or materials recovery, bathroom blocks, laundry facilities, and even food production.\nCoupled with the Biopolus Aero.Green aeroponic food growth module that uses a unique method of production in a lightweight and mobile system, the hubs can support the provision of healthy, nutritious food where water is scarce, space limited, and the population large. The system uses an atomised nutrient solution to control nutrient content and minimise water use, producing plants with aerated root systems that are less susceptible to infection by pests and disease.\nTakao Furuno, a Japanese farmer, has developed a duck/rice/fish farming system that avoids using lots of fertilisers and pesticides in growing rice and produces a wide range of additional food products. This system has boosted the farm’s rice yields 20-50% beyond industrial rice systems’ yields, and gross income from the six-acre farm sometimes exceeds the income of an American 600-acre rice farm.\nThe complex system required careful planning. After the rice seeding, ducklings go into the paddies to feed on insects that attack young rice plants. Then fish and paddy weed are introduced. The paddy weed fixes nitrogen and provides food for the fish and the ducks. The nitrogen and the droppings from the fish and ducks provide all the nutrients that the rice needs. The ducks oxygenate the water and encourage the roots of the rice plants to grow, while digging up weeds with their feet.\nLaunched by the Indian conglomerate ITC, e-Choupal seeks to increase the economic and competitive capacity of farmers and agricultural communities by providing internet access to rural farmers.\nThe e-Choupal platform gives farmers access to market information and best practices via computers in the homes of farmers trained to use ITC’s agricultural website. The system provides demand information for available markets, reducing the mismatch of supply and demand that often forces farmers to discard parts of their produce. Pricing information positions farmers to exploit trends and time their sales to get the best price.\nThe e-Choupal platform builds farmers’ understanding of the market, reducing the need for the intermediaries who traditionally control the trading process. e-Choupal also enables farmers to share advice on managing risks like soil contamination or salinity.\nFarmers have definitely benefitted from e-Choupal. Data on acreage and yield, 2000 — 2012, shows that profits of farmers accessing the e-Choupal platform almost tripled. Soya farmers learned how to apply scientific farming practices to reduce seed use from 40-45 kg per acre to 30-35. In 2015 four million farmers used the service via 6,500 e-Choupal access points spread over 40,000 villages in 11 states.\nAn NGO based in Pune, INORA works in research, education, and technology transfer for regenerative farming and nutrient recovery, specifically composting and anaerobic digestion. INORA’s decentralised technological solutions enable the transformation of food waste into nutrients that the agricultural system can use in both rural and urban settings.\nINORA serves single households, housing complexes, industrial kitchens, farms, and municipalities. The company processes material for over 300 housing societies, 35 schools, and 14 industrial projects and works with some 100,000 citizens and 300 organic farmers.\nINORA’s anaerobic digestion technology can be small enough for use in a single building, with units built to digest about 3 kg of food waste a day that produce 90 minutes’ worth of gas for cooking, as well as 60 litres of liquid organic fertiliser. This fertiliser contains enough nutrients for an urban farming project, such as a small roof-top garden with about 250 plants. INORA’s larger anaerobic digestion plants can process approximately 5 tonnes of food waste a day and produce biogas equivalent to 300 kWh of energy, as well as some 10 tonnes of biogas slurry.\nINORA has also implemented industrial composting solutions that can process 2 tonnes of food waste a day and produce 400 kg of compost.\nMahindra launched the e2o, an EV designed for urban use in 2013. The car is available for purchase or use through car-sharing pools.\nThe EV has a charging cord that plugs into a regular 15 amp socket and needs 90 minutes to power a cruising range of 100-130 kilometres. The car is complemented by an app for monitoring performance metrics, charging status, remaining range, and other features.\nInnovative solutions enable more efficient utilisation of the car and its components. Mahindra’s collaboration with the car pool Zoomcar allows users to pay per hour, day, or week, rather than having to own the car.\nIn Bhutan, customers can also opt for the ‘Goodbye Fuel Hello Electric’ programme. When they buy the EV, Mahindra retains ownership of the car battery, guaranteeing its performance for a monthly usage fee.\nUK-based car manufacturer Riversimple provides vehicles as a service. Instead of buying cars, customers pay a monthly fee that covers use, maintenance, insurance, and fuel, while Riversimple retains ownership. Riversimple thus takes a whole system approach to its value chain and strives to maximise use of materials and components.\nRiversimple leases most car components from suppliers, assembles the car, and leases it to customers. The business model makes efficiency profitable and gives both Riversimple and its suppliers an economic incentive to design the car and components to last. The longer the car and its components last, the longer Riversimple and the suppliers generate revenue from them.\nRiversimple cars operate efficiently. Rasa, Riversimple’s first and only model, uses a hydrogen-powered fuel cell that does not emit any GHG, only water. The car is made of strong, light composite materials that reduce its kerb weight to 580 kg, allowing a range of around 500 kilometres. The Rasa is set to be commercially available by 2019, and Riversimple is planning to make the technology open source to enable fast adoption in different markets.\nHelsinki, the capital of Finland, is planning to transform its transport system by implementing a point-to-point, mobility-on-demand network by 2025. The network will integrate all transport options, including buses, taxis, car pools, and shared bikes, on a single payment platform.\nThe user will access the platform via a smartphone app. The app will function as a journey planner, with the user entering origin and destination and receiving available travel routes. The digital system will enable purchasing mobility in real time with a single click or touch.\nThe transport system will be flexible and effective. The user will buy kilometre-based packages based on time of day, weather, and other variables. Bus routes will be dynamic, changing based on demand. Users will input preferences in the app if they have special needs. Ultimately, the transport system is expected to be convenient enough to compete with private car ownership.\nRethinking growth for long-term prosperityDownload the full report\neconomic growth per year in the last decade\npeople in 2050.

So much so, Eco retrofitted its first digester – also realising a big reduction in energy costs.\nExternally mounted GasMix systems, designed and manufactured by Landia, have helped Eco Sustainable Solutions increase the amount of biogas it produces by 12.5%.\nGasMix, which utilities Landia’s chopper pump, replaced inefficient and unreliable rotary submerged equipment. The retrofit has also reduced the energy use of mixing equipment by 50%.\nThe 1.6MW AD facility in Piddlehinton, near Dorchester, takes in food waste from around 60,000 Dorset households, plus liquid waste from milk and cheese production. At first, around 5 to 10% chicken manure was added to the feedstock, but gas yields have remained higher without.\nSince the installation of GasMix, which was also chosen for ease of access (no moving parts inside the tank) and vastly reduced health and safety risks, the digesters’ contents are kept at a constant 41ºC, with a retention time of 40 days.\nInitially, Eco had employed the standard rotary submerged equipment for its first digester, but opted instead for Landia’s GasMix when the second digester was built. Such was the noticeable increase in gas, plus additional benefits, the first digester was then retrofitted with Landia’s GasMix.\nA total of four Landia GasMix systems serve the two 2500m³ digesters, utilising 18.5kW chopper pumps to generate a total of 700m³ gas per hour. Total mixing is achieved via specially angled recirculation nozzles. Compared to many energy-burning systems that have to run flat-out, 24/7, Landia’s GasMix at Piddlehinton only needs to operate for approximately 10 minutes per hour. Despite using 18.5kW motors, compared to typical 7.5kW submersible units, GasMix has been shown to use fifty per cent less energy than the previous system.\nEco Sustainable Solutions’ Managing Director, Trelawney Dampney, commented: “Primarily, we chose the Landia GasMix system because all the pumps and pipe-work parts are on the outside of the digesters, so importantly, can be maintained without interruption to our 24/7 process. Since the installation, we have had absolutely no performance or reliability issues, but to see such an improvement in the process by way of increased gas, as well as reducing our energy usage, is a massive bonus. For any AD operator, a proven boost of twelve and a half per cent is very significant.”\nEven at 15 minutes per hour, the energy usage is just 110 kW per day, compared to 180 kW. This is on just one mixer/pump.\nThe 2.5 acre site, which was Eco’s first move into renewable energy, supplies 60% of its power to Mole Valley Farmers’ neighbouring Dorchester Feed Mill, the first feed mill in the UK to be powered completely by renewables. The remaining 40% generated is sold on to the National Grid. PAS 110-approved digestate is also sold on as fertiliser to two local farms.\nThe success of Landia’s GasMix at Piddlehinton has already drawn international attention with the visit by a delegation of business leaders from South Korea who made a special trip to site. The delegation included representatives from the Korea Environment Corporation, the country's Ministry of Environment, two engineering companies and a livestock cooperative association. On a separate visit to the UK, the South Korean delegation also visited Landia at Whitchurch in Shropshire to take a closer look at the pump and mixer manufacturer, from whom they had placed an order for GasMix systems as a direct result of their visit to Eco. Goods were rigorously inspected before leaving on their 5,000 mile journey to East Asia.\nPaul Davies, Key Account Manager at Landia, commented: “This was a very significant day at our premises on Waymills Industrial Estate. Our guests from South Korea very much liked what they’d seen at Eco and placed a sizeable order with us. The visit to Whitchurch gave our visitors the opportunity to see Landia for themselves and make a detailed inspection of the GasMix systems we’ve built for them. As with Eco, their initial interest was in reliability and ease of service, but such a vast improvement in gas yields and overall optimisation of the process was impossible to ignore.”\nIn separate tests, GasMix reduced viscosity by more than 31% when used in a heat exchange tank treating agricultural residues prior to anaerobic digestion.\nThis reduced viscosity input from the heat exchange tank allowed for a twelve and a half per cent reduction in downstream reactor mixing times, equivalent to a saving of 210 kWh per day in electrical consumption.\nTrelawney Dampney added: “Completed on time and within budget, our AD facility at Piddlehinton is proving itself as a highly efficient plant and I believe will act as a blueprint for future resource projects.”\nDo you like or dislike what you have read?

{"question":"What legal customs were common to Celtic societies, and how was the 'Boston' manuscript of Welsh law recently preserved for future generations?","answer":"Celtic societies shared some common legal traditions, including placing more importance on restitution than punishment and using the concept of honor-price (compensation based on social rank). They also had similar terms across languages, such as the Gaelic 'macc' and Welsh 'mach' for surety. The Boston manuscript of Welsh law was acquired by the National Library of Wales for £541,250 with support from the Heritage Lottery Fund. After public display, it underwent conservation, digitization, and creation of a facsimile copy. The manuscript is particularly valuable as it contains handwritten additions showing its use as a working law text by an itinerant judge in 14th century South Wales.","context":["‘Boston’ Manuscript of the Laws of Hywel Dda arrives home at NLW\nThe manuscript will only be on show for a limited period, 23 July – 31 August, before being taken into the care of the Library’s conservators to be rebound and digitised.\nThe manuscript was bought by the National Library for £541,250 at auction in Sotheby’s in London on 10 July. The Heritage Lottery Fund (HLF) supported the bid with a grant £467,000 with the remainder of the money from the library’s own funds, as well as a grant from the Welsh Government.\nAndrew Green, the Librarian of the National Library Wales, said: \"It’s obvious that without the substantial financial support and swift organisational response from the HLF that the National Library would not have been able to buy this important manuscript. Put simply, without the HLF this manuscript of the Laws of Hywel Dda would not have returned to its homeland. The National Library, on behalf of the Welsh people, are immensely grateful to the Heritage Lottery Fund and its Chair, Dr Manon Williams, for their willing and decisive support.\"\nDr Manon Williams, Chair of the HLF Committee for Wales, said: \"This manuscript is one of Wales’ true treasures and I’m delighted to see it back home and in the National Library of Wales, where experts can now study and interpret it ensuring it is better understood for the first time. I hope local people and visitors will take this unique opportunity to come and see this important piece of Welsh history on display.\"\nThe manuscript will be exhibited at the Library’s Hengwrt Room. This is the library’s special gallery for exhibiting rare books and manuscripts which at the moment is also exhibiting medieval Welsh seals. Following the public display it will be studied by the Library’s expert staff , conserved and a facsimile copy made and it will then be digitised so it can be exhibited on the Library’s website for all to see and study. This process should be complete by the end of 2012 and the MSS will then be kept at the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth, alongside other manuscripts of its time.\nPlans are in place for a programme of education and training opportunities for existing staff, new apprentices and volunteers to learn new skills and play their part in saving the manuscript for the future. There are also plans for a touring exhibition of the facsimile.\nInformation about the manuscript\nThe pocket-sized book, written in medieval Welsh and featuring coloured decoration, is one of the earliest manuscript of its kind ever offered in a public sale and was auctioned by the Massachusetts Historical Society who were likely to have been given the manuscript as a gift from Welsh emigrants in the early 19th century.\nThe Laws of Hywel Dda is a long-established descriptive term encompassing the native Welsh laws which were codified in the 10th century in South West Wales. The surviving texts can be found in around 30 manuscripts dating from the 13th – 16th centuries in Welsh and Latin.\nThis small parchment volume is a very early example of a key text in the history of Welsh law and would have been used by an itinerant judge in South Wales in the 14th century. It offers a new window into the development of Welsh identity and cultural life.\nUnlike most other Welsh medieval manuscripts, the Boston Manuscript has handwritten additions demonstrating its use as a working law text. It is much closer to the reality and practice of the law at the time, and offers plenty of scope for important new research.","Kingship and Authority\nThe rites of inauguration used to invest power in a new king are symbolic statements of cultural values and ideals at the highest level of society. Textual descriptions of inauguration and secular power are only preserved in Gaelic sources from about the 7th century onwards in Ireland and Gaelic Scotland (the illustration below depicts the inauguration of Uí Néill in the late 16th century). There is little left to inform us about the inaugural rites of the early Brittonic or Pictish kingdoms.\nInauguration is referred to as rígad in Old Gaelic, although in some accounts the term banais-ríge (literally “king-marriage”) drew explicit attention to inauguration as a form of wedding between the leader and the sovereignty goddess of the territory. Although there was no single ritual of inauguration in Gaelic society, there are a number of common\nelements which recur in accounts of these ceremonies in both Scotland and Ireland, from kings to clan chiefs:\n- A poet or cleric conducts the ceremony, enumerating the leader’s ancestry and invoking a blessing on him and his reign;\n- It is on or near a burial mound containing a ceremonial stone, and under or near a sacred tree;\n- It includes the leader’s horse or chariot (in reality or symbolically);\n- The leader’s garment or mantle is given to the master of the ceremony;\n- There is a single footprint, shoe or sandal into which the leader steps;\n- The leader is anointed;\n- The leader drinks alcohol from a ceremonial vessel;\n- The leader is presented with the rod of sovereignty (slat tighearnais), sometimes a wand cut from the sacred tree.\nBy the late 8th century, the church had inserted itself into the ordination of the kings of Ireland, as recorded in 793 at the inauguration of Artrí mac Cathail in Munster. Regardless, poets continued to play a central role in the validation of Gaelic rulers in both Scotland and Ireland up to the early modern era.\nWhat aspects of the inauguration ritual, and symbolism of kingship, are referred to by the poem “Aed oll fri andud nane”? How is the relationship between ruler and poet represented, especially in terms of what each one does for, or offers to, the other?\nWhereas in the previous time period (400-600), we saw the development of the office of the king and the ideology of kingship in the Insular Celtic context, during this time period we see that the institutions of the kingdom were being consolidated and extending their reach. This is visible amongst all of the ethnic groups (Celts and Anglo-Saxons) and had as much to do with secular ambition as the extension of the authority of religious institutions and the ideals of Christian kingship.\nAs the king’s power grew, so did the size of his territory and retinue. It would have exhausted the estate of the king himself to feed and house his military retinue (aka comitatus), so the king travelled with them around the clients on his territories who took turns billeting the royal company. Such obligations of lodging and feeding were an integral part of the client-lord relationship and allowed clients the chance to curry favour with their leader.\nAlthough originally, and in theory, each tuath in Ireland was a sovereign state impenetrable by overlords (or “overkings”), we can already see in the 8th century that some kings are being demoted in status to the lesser rank of “lord” (the title used in Latin sources is dux) due to the steady pressure of overkings. This title was used in Ireland of the ruler of the Delbna Ethra in 756, and the rulers of Luigne and Ciarraige in 771 and 796. The extension of Pictish overlord-ship over smaller kingdoms, and the consolidation of kingdoms in Wales, has already been discussed. The kingdom of Northumbria exemplified similar processes in the Anglo-Saxon(ized) sphere.\nThe instability of food resources – bad seasons, unpredictable harvests, etc – made conspicuous consumption at feasts all the more significant displays of status. High social status was closely related to good nutrition and health, as is apparent in many contemporary texts, though often expressed in formulaic language.\nThe Cult of Saints\nVirtually all religions recognize certain places which are sacred, charged with special significance and power, often because of their association with particular events and people revered in the narratives of the religion. Initially Christianity had disavowed the cult of holy places, but by the end of the fourth century it had been reconceptualized and reintegrated into the religion. Empress Helena, mother of Roman Emperor Constantine, claimed to have discovered the Holy Rood in the mid-4th century, sparking a fashion for other “discoveries” of fragments of the cross on which Christ had died and pilgrimages of Christians to see these relics.\nPopes of the late 8th and early 9th century sanctioned the practice of pilgrimage to the cemeteries of Rome, which encouraged other churches to create spaces where the remains of their own local dignitaries could be deposited and visited.\nThe cult of saints gave believers a tangible and local connection to the sacred. Rome was far away, and an almighty god in the heavens could seem equally distant: the cult of saints provided people with human intermediaries (saints with local connections) and physical objects (relics) which allowed them to participate in religious experiences rooted in their own localities.\nThe cult of saints born in Celtic regions, embracing the relics of those saints and the sites of their activities, was active in Scotland by the seventh century. Although Adomnán’s biography of Saint Columba (written by 704) may have further promoted the veneration of the saint, it is clear that Colum Cille enjoyed cult status by the time it was written. By the 8th century, the Virgin Mary also enjoyed special reverence by the Columban monastery on Iona. Adomnán’s book De Locis Sanctis “Of Holy Places” (about the holy places of Palestine) may have aided in spreading the practice of endowing hereditary keepers to safeguard holy relics in Gaeldom.\nThe cult of saints seems to have been a much more local affair in Celtic regions than elsewhere: many saints are known at only one site. It was taboo in Cornwall and Wales to relocate the remains of a saint, so the focus of the cult tended to be the site of the grave. In Ireland, by contrast, a saint’s remains could be broken into parts (finger joints, arm-bones, ribs, etc), making it easier to proliferate his/her cult.\nChurches were closely connected to secular power: they were run by people who typically came from powerful dynasties and were financed by the patronage of local leaders. It was to the advantage of such rulers to promote the popularity of the saint(s) whose cult was centred at their church; this could bring them further status, prestige, and authority to justify their secular power; it could also bring in the wealth of other patrons and pilgrims.\nSecular Legal Traditions\nLaw is one of the key elements in ethnic identity: the legal framework and traditions in Celtic communities continued not only to provide common standards of conduct and points of reference to those who shared it, but also provided a contrast with the alien legal systems of outsiders. It is thus no surprise that English kings made great efforts to impose English law on the Celtic peoples in the process of conquest and subjugation.\nThere is at least some small common core of customary law which had been practiced in early Celtic civilizations and survived in some Celtic communities into the medieval period, as evidenced by legal terminology inherited by the different Celtic languages. The Gaelic term for surety (a means of guaranteeing that all parties of a contract will fulfill their obligations) is macc, clearly related to Welsh and Breton mach.\nOne general pattern is that Celtic law placed more importance on restitution than on punishment: in other words, the victim of a crime (which extended to his kin-group) was to be compensated by the criminal (which again could implicate his kin-group). Punishment was reserved for special cases, as it could not usually heal the consequences of the crime or prevent another. However, the status of the individuals involved were also major factors in judgment, as these were societies based on rank, not on social equality.\nThe concept of honour-price [Common Gaelic lóg n-enech “face value”] is fundamental to Celtic law (as in many other law systems); this is the fine to be paid to a victim (or his kin) if any offense was done to him, whether to his honour (e.g., slander) or to his person (injury, murder, etc). Honour-price was generally directly related to social rank, with the king being highest. A person’s honour-price could be diminished if he behaved below his rank, or augmented if he upgraded his skill set or added to his wealth. A dependent (e.g., child, wife, disabled person) did not have an independent honour- price; it was, rather, a fraction of the legally-recognized person to whom they were attached, depending on age, gender, and nature of relationship.\nAnother common feature of Irish and Welsh law systems was the support for divorce initiated by the wife, a right which met with the disapproval of the church. Irish law allowed for polygamy and secular lawyers defended this pre-Christian practice by pointing out its use amongst the Jews in the Old Testament.\nUnlike many legal systems in continental Europe, Irish law was not a legacy of the Roman empire and could not rely upon the help of scholars familiar with the Roman legal tradition; after all, Irish law was written in Gaelic, despite the existence of many contemporary Latin scholars, and draws upon native terminology and concepts (even if it also borrows from Christian texts). One of the truly remarkable aspects of early Ireland, at least from our surviving evidence, is that despite the proliferation of dozens of independently operating kingdoms and a lack of a central authority, the country was surprisingly uniform in both language and culture. Whether law (and associated cultural practices) was the result of this or the cause of this unity, early Irish law is a wonder of early European civilization.\nBy the 7th century, the Irish clergy were involved in the recording and refashioning of customary Irish law, which had been transmitted and practiced orally, into a sophisticated written textual tradition. This allowed for the development of Gaelic law in new directions, but it also provided the ability of literate churchmen to edit and interfere in the legal system. Irish law is often called “Brehon law” in English after the Gaelic word for judge (in plural form) breitheamhan.\nThere are a number of clues about the origins of Irish law which, if they are not actually rooted in the pre-Christian past, at least provide the veneer of antiquity and indigeneity. Many of the principles and precedents of Irish law are attributed to pagan characters, many of which were clearly gods and some of whom represent professions: Bretha Déin Chécht “the judgments of Dian Cécht” related to legal aspects of medicine, Bretha Goibnenn “the judgments of Goibniu” related legal aspects of blacksmiths, and so on. None of the fundamental principles or judgments are named after mere mortals, although Saint Patrick was said in the prologue to one law tract to help transform pagan Irish law to a written tradition. After this act of transcription, the secular poets (filid) were said to have been taken out of the legal profession (no doubt oral law relied upon mnemonic devices such as ornament poetry). Although we cannot read account this as literal historical evidence, it is an important symbolic endorsement of the results of the “harmonization” of Irish law with the Christian order and literacy.\nThere was a complex and sometimes fraught relationship between secular law traditions and the church, who were seeking to modify secular society to meet Christian standards. Some Irish lawmen tried to defend the older laws against the new law (sometime referred cryptically to as the “written law” of the “men of books”). By the 8th century, clerics were trying to impose capital punishment for extreme crimes, whereas the traditional Celtic law system had allowed for the payment of compensation, even for crimes like homicide (éraic).\nEarly Irish law abounds in detail and precision: there is a large number of tracts on very specific issues, although many of these tracts only survive in fragments. Over the generations, the bare statements of laws were elaborated and explained in longer texts which “gloss” the original texts, resulting in strands of interweaving texts (such as that shown in the Book of Aicill above). Our understanding of the laws is complicated by the fact that it evolved independently in different regions under the guidance of different schools of law; thus, variations in usage and terminology appear over the centuries in the surviving records.\nThe same dynasties that wielded secular power were also those that became the leaders of religious institutions, with succession of office determined in the same manner. The honour-price of members of religious orders was calculated by mirroring their position in secular society. Certain legal concepts and aspects of social organization were adopted in the church’s own structure and operation: free/unfree status and clientship, usually applied to people, were extended to churches and relationships between monasteries and churches.19 As it was involved in the creation and operation of law, the church ensured its own rights to wealth (it took a third of the fine paid by a client who neglected the obligations to his lord) and tried to inherit for itself land owned by a landowner who died without leaving male heirs.\nThe legal system included mechanisms for adding or changing laws. A specifically enacted regulation (as opposed to customary law) was originally denoted as cáin (pl. cána), a term which by the late 8th referred to the laws of the church (by the late medieval period it denoted taxes). By the late 8th century, all of the major monasteries were proclaiming their own cána and collecting fines from those who broke these laws.\nLawyers attempted to modify legal procedures in order to minimize conflict and disruption society. The practice of distraint (the seizure of property to force a person to comply with a legal ruling or obligations) was modified from the initial policy of an immediate seizure of goods without notice, to informing the offender that the goods were taken, to giving an advanced warning of the intention to seize the goods, to finally threatening that goods would be impounded and rewarded to the claimant if no resolution was made within a set period of time.\nWhat does Críth Gablach “Branched Purchase” § 61-2 say about the relationship between church and secular society?\nHow does the Prologue to the Senchus Már attempt to resolve pre-Christian Irish law with the new Christian order?\nThe evidence of the Welsh law system, especially from what survives in the later Laws of Hywel Dda (codified in the mid-10th century), depicts Welsh society as\na stable, sedentary arable-based sector in which the extended family or clan-group lived in robust farm-steads. In terms of landholding, the general trend was for partible inheritance to nibble away at large estates (gwelyau) up to the mid-eleventh century. Apart from the slave, who possessed no rights, there were three important categories: the king (brenin), the noble (breyr) and the villein (bilain), who was tied to both lord and land. Within these groups, claims to status depended on descent, kinship, and wealth. (Jenkins, A Concise History)\nLike early Irish law, some texts in early Welsh law also appears to use the kind of linguistic features that would make it suitable for oral preservation and transmission, such as the use of triads. If this, and the evidence of shared terminology derived from a common Celtic source, were not enough to demonstrate that it has a pre-history which is now difficult to detect, there is the fact that some aspects of Brittonic law survived in the kingdom of Alt Clut to be later absorbed into Scottish law (discussed in a later unit).\nRead the Surexit Memorandum extract from the “Lichfield Gospel notes,” the earliest surviving evidence about Welsh law.

{"question":"How did the role of military intelligence differ in the Battle of Upperville compared to South Mountain in terms of impacting Union strategy?","answer":"At Upperville, the Union forces under Pleasonton repeatedly failed to gather intelligence about Lee's movements despite multiple cavalry engagements, with Stuart's screening tactics successfully keeping them in the dark. In contrast, at South Mountain, McClellan had obtained crucial intelligence through Special Order 191 revealing Lee's battle plans, though he failed to fully capitalize on this advantage by waiting 18 hours before acting.","context":["The Battle of Upperville, which took place on June 21, 1863, was one of the engagements during Robert E. Lee's Gettysburg Campaign.\nLee Heads North\nIn early May 1863, Confederate General Robert E. Lee’s Army of Northern Virginia soundly defeated Major General Joseph Hooker’s Army of the Potomac at the Battle of Chancellorsville. Despite the Rebel victory, Lee’s army was in need of food, horses, and equipment after the battle. With northern Virginia ravaged by two years of combat, Lee decided to take the war to the North.\nLee planned to disengage from Union forces near Fredericksburg, move the Army of Northern Virginia northwest across the Blue Ridge Mountains, and then push northeast through the Shenandoah Valley into Maryland and Pennsylvania. Lee began consolidating his army near Culpeper, Virginia, and troop movements began on June 3, 1863.\nCavalry Engagement at Brandy Station\nTo mask his intentions and screen the assembly of his invasion force, Lee stationed his cavalry, commanded by Major General J.E.B. Stuart, at Brandy Station, a few miles northeast of Culpeper. On June 9, Union Major General Alfred Pleasonton’s Cavalry Corps launched a surprise attack against Stuart’s Cavalry Division near Brandy Station. After an all-day fight, Pleasonton retired without discovering Lee’s main encampment at Culpeper, only six miles away.\nSecond Battle of Winchester\nAfter the Battle of Brandy Station, Lee’s army continued its trek northwest toward Winchester in the Shenandoah Valley where roughly 6,900 troops were garrisoned under the command of Brigadier General Robert Milroy. On June 13, Lieutenant General Richard Ewell’s 2nd Army Corps reached Winchester and initiated a three-day engagement that forced Milroy’s evacuation, clearing the upper Shenandoah Valley for Lee’s advancement.\nStuart Screens Lee’s Movements\nAs Lee continued to move north on the west side of the Blue Ridge Mountains, he ordered Stuart’s Cavalry to move in the same direction through the Loudoun Valley on the east side of the mountains, screening the Confederate invasion force. Lee instructed Stuart to prevent Federal reconnaissance forces from advancing through gaps in the mountains to gather information about the Army of Northern Virginia’s movements. Part of Stuart’s orders included holding the Ashby’s Gap Turnpike and the Snickersville Turnpike, two strategic roads leading through the mountains.\nBattle of Aldie\nFrustrated by the lack of intelligence about Lee’s movements, on June 16, 1863, Hooker ordered Pleasonton, “to give him information of where the enemy is, his force, and his movements.” On June 17, Pleasonton ordered Major General David Gregg’s division to seize and occupy Aldie, where the two roads converged, setting the stage for a cavalry engagement that afternoon.\nStuart Establishes New Line Near Upperville\nOn the same day, Pleasonton determined to seize the hamlet of Middleburg about five miles west of Aldie, where Stuart had established his headquarters. A series of back-and-forth engagements over the next two days forced Stuart to withdraw about eight miles to the west and establish a new defensive line across the Ashby Gap Turnpike near the village of Upperville. Despite the fact that Stuart had ceded Middleburg, his forces still blocked the Ashby Gap through the Blue Ridge Mountains, and Pleasonton knew no more about Lee’s movements than he did when the fighting began.\nPleasonton rested his troops during a daylong downpour on June 20, before renewing his efforts to penetrate Stuart’s cavalry screen. At Pleasonton’s request, Hooker deployed infantry units from Major General George Meade’s 5th Corps to support the Union cavalry.\nMeanwhile, Stuart was consolidating his cavalry in the area of Upperville. He deployed brigades commanded by Brigadier General Wade Hampton and Brigadier General Beverly Robertson along the Ashby Gap Turnpike. He also moved Brigadier General John R. Chambliss’s brigade north of the turnpike where they joined Brigadier General William E. “Grumble” Jones’s brigade near Union, Virginia. Farther north, Colonel Thomas T. Munford’s brigade guarded access to the Snickersville Gap. Finally, Stuart assigned Major John Mosby’s rangers to scout Pleasonton’s movements.\nFederals Attack at Upperville\nThe next morning, Sunday, June 21, on Pleasonton’s orders, Brigadier General Judson Kilpatrick’s cavalry brigade, supported by a brigade of infantry, assaulted Stuart’s troopers where the Ashby Gap Turnpike crosses Goose Creek. Stuart’s outnumbered force withstood the initial Federal surge, but gradually withdrew westward toward Upperville, using stone walls and deep ravines for cover.\nAs Union forces continued to press the issue along the turnpike, Jones and Chambliss repulsed an effort by Brigadier General John Buford to turn Stuart’s left flank. Following pitched fighting on two fronts Stuart withdrew once again, taking up a stronger defensive position at the Ashby Gap through the Blue Ridge Mountains.\nPleasonton chose not to press the issue and returned to Aldie. Once again, Stuart’s strategy of giving up ground to buy time deprived Pleasonton of vital information about Lee’s movements, which he was desperately seeking.\nNational Park Service historians estimate that casualties at the Battle of Upperville totaled 400 soldiers from both sides.","Battle of South Mountain facts for kids\nThe Battle of South Mountain was fought on September 14, 1862 in Maryland’s South Mountain between Confederate and Union forces. The Battle of South Mountain was a very important battle. It was the first major battle fought north of the Potomac River. It was the first invasion of the Northern United States by a Confederate Army. It was also here and not at Antietam where the Confederates under General Robert E. Lee were defeated and turned back. The day-long pitched battle was fought for control of the three passes through the mountain: Crampton's, Turner's, and Fox's Gaps.\nDuring the summer of 1862, the hopes of the Union that the rebellion could be easily crushed were quickly fading. In July, Major General George B. McClellan failed in his attempt to capture the Southern capital at Richmond, Virginia. Near the end of August, the Second Battle of Bull Run was another defeat for the Union. Shortly after the battle, Lee made his plans to invade the north. Lee led his Army of Northern Virginia into Maryland on September 4, 1862. Lee thought that if he took the Civil War to the Union states, a major victory might convince Great Britain and France to support the South. He also thought it would make the North sue for peace. This would insure the Confederate States of America could remain an independent country.\nMcClellan remained in command of the Army of the Potomac even though he had failed to support Major General John Pope at the Second Battle of Bull Run. When Lee entered Maryland, in a rare exception to his usual slowness, McClellan moved more quickly to cut him off. Unknown to Lee at the time, a Union soldier had found a copy of Special Order 191. This was Lee's plan to split up his army. McClellan learned Lee had sent General Stonewall Jackson to attack and hold the Harpers Ferry Armory. The information gave McClellan the chance to destroy Lee's army while it was still weakened by Jackson's attack on Harpers Ferry. McClellan learned of Lee's plan on September 13. He boasted \"Here is a paper with which if I cannot whip Bobbie Lee, I will be willing to go home.\" He also sent a telegram to President Lincoln where he wrote, \"I have all the plans of the rebels, and will catch them in their own trap if my men are equal to the emergency.\" But McClellan waited another 18 hours before acting. This delay allowed Lee more time to collect all the elements of his army. As Lee had moved into Maryland, he left detachments to guard two of the passes through South Mountain, Crampton's Gap and Turner's Gap. These were the two most important routes through the 50-mile long South Mountain. Had McClellan moved a little faster, he would have caught Lee's army scattered on the other side of the mountain.\nOn September 14, the battle took place on three gaps. A few Confederate regiments guarded the two northern gaps, Turner's and Fox's and Crampton's Gap to the south. The Union army advanced from the east and attacked in two waves. The first wave attacked Fox's Gap at about 9 am. Early in the afternoon the second wave hit both Fox's and Turner's Gaps at the same time. Crampton's Gap was attacked in the late afternoon.\nThe distance between Crampton's and Turner's Gaps is about six miles. The terrain between them made each part of the battle a separate fight. The fighting went on all day at Turner's Gap and all afternoon at Crampton's Gap. Turner's Gap was fought on a larger scale, was more costly and took longer than the other actions. This delaying action was also a large deception by the Confederate forces. The Union forces thought the mountain was swarming with Confederates when in fact only one division guarded the passes until later in the afternoon. Union forces could have easily swept them aside had they known how few there actually were.\nMcClellan's concentrating his attack on the Confederates on South Mountain meant he did not help the garrison at the Battle of Harpers Ferry. From having a copy of Lee's Special Order 191, McClellan knew Jackson was attacking the Union Forces at Harpers Ferry. What little help he did send arrived too late to prevent the surrender. It also gave Lee the time he needed to gather his forces together at Sharpsburg, Maryland. Had McClellan moved faster and more decisively, the costly Battle of Antietam might never have taken place. Confederate losses for the day amounted to 2,700 soldiers. The Union losses were 2,300 dead or wounded. The Confederates were able to delay McClellan's forces by fiercely defending the gaps. This gave Lee precious time to regroup and move on to Sharpsburg where the Battle of Antietam pitted the two armies against each other again. The battle of South Mountain, however, forced Lee to give up his plans for invading the North and caused him to have to defend his army.\nImages for kids\nBattle of South Mountain Facts for Kids.

{"question":"How do Chinese idioms help overcome language barriers, and what decision-making techniques can prevent misunderstandings in cross-cultural teams?","answer":"Chinese idioms help overcome language barriers by having similar counterparts in English, like 'Kill two birds with one stone' matching the Chinese '一箭双雕' (one arrow, two eagles), making meaning clearer across cultures. To prevent cross-cultural misunderstandings in teams, specific decision-making techniques like the Nominal Group Technique ensure all members participate fully by having individuals write ideas independently first, then share in order, discuss each idea, and finally vote - this helps avoid groupthink and encourages input from diverse perspectives.","context":["For non-native speakers, one of the hardest aspects of learning a new language are the idioms. Picture this: You run up to your friend Thomas to tell him that you were chosen to make a speech at the school ceremony tonight, and it goes a little something like…\n“Hey Thomas, the school picked me to make a speech at the celebration tonight!”\n“No! You are twisting my arm! Congrats on that, just be cool as a cucumber and it should be a piece of cake!”\nIf you are a non-English speaker, you may be confused. You haven't even touched his arm, and what’s all this about cucumbers and cakes?\nIdioms are phrases that have developed over time to take on meanings that go beyond their literal definition. They often rely on analogies, metaphors, and historical background to define their meaning. The funny coincidence is, despite the cultural and historical differences between Western countries and China, there are many English idioms with a “twin” in Chinese.\nWe created a list of our favorite English idioms that have Chinese counterparts. Some of these idioms are rooted in history, some are quite similar in phrasing to their English equivalent, and some make chuckle-worthy and unexpected comparisons. Without further ado, here are our favorite English idioms that also exist in Chinese.\n1. Speak of the devil /说曹操，曹操到(Shuō cáocāo, cáocāo dào)\nThe Chinese version refers to a historical figure, 曹操 (cáo cāo), who was a general during the Three Kingdoms period. He had eyes and ears everywhere, spying on people to detect any signs of political unrest. As a result, he was able to take swift action at the earliest signs of rebellion. People had to be careful whenever they want to mention 曹操 ‘s name!\nIf you are gossiping about someone, and within seconds the subject of your gossip shows up, you would be right to use this phrase.\n(曹操 was so prominent in ancient Chinese culture that he's a main character in the Red Cliff movie series, which made our list here: Chinese Movies You Need Watch.)\n2. When in Rome, do as the Romans/入乡随俗 (Rù xiāng suí sú)\nGuests must observe the customs of place they are visiting. This phrase is used to tell people to assimilate to a new culture out of respect and to be at peace with their new surroundings. So when you are in China, try the popular drink Baijiu when you get a chance!\n3. Every cloud has a silver lining/塞翁失马 (Sài wēng shī mǎ)\n塞翁失马 is a well-known ChengYu passed down for thousands of years in Chinese culture. 塞翁 was an old man during the Warring State Period. One day, one of his favorite horses ran away. The neighbors came over to console him, but 塞翁 said: “It’s okay to lose a horse, maybe it will bring luck.”\nIn a few days, the runaway horse came home, and brought along another handsome horse. The neighbors came over this time to congratulate him, but 塞翁 was instead worried. He said: “To find a horse is not necessarily a good thing. Maybe it will cause trouble.” Sure enough, 塞翁’s son was riding the new horse when he fell and broke his leg.\nThe neighbors came over to cheer up 塞翁, but he cheerily said: “Don’t worry, he broke his leg but is still alive, maybe this is a good thing.” His neighbors thought the old man had lost his mind. However, not long after, a draft for the war started, and 塞翁’s son was spared because of his broken leg.\nThis fable goes to show that in each bad event, some benefit can be derived, which is similar to the English “Every cloud has a silver lining.” However, 塞翁失马 also shows the converse situation, in that each good event could also lead to something bad.\n4. Kill two birds with one stone/一箭双雕 (Yī jiàn shuāng diāo)\nThe Chinese 一箭双雕 is almost an exact parallel to the English “Kill two birds with one stone,” except instead of the stone, the Chinese version uses “箭 (jiàn)”, which means “arrow.” Both of these phrases are metaphors for accomplishing two goals by doing only one task.\n5. To each his own /萝卜青菜，各有所爱 (Luóbo qīngcài, gè yǒu suǒ ài)\n“To each his own” means that each person has a right to his or her own personal preferences. The Chinese version of this phrase makes a specific analogy, in that its literal translation means “There are people who like radishes, and people who like green vegetables.” Just because you don’t like something, doesn’t mean that other people won’t.\n6. Can't judge a book by its cover/人不可貌相 (Rén bùkě màoxiàng)\nYou cannot judge a book by its cover, and you cannot judge a person by his looks. Both the English and Chinese version of this idiom tell us that we should not make shallow judgements about the value of something based on its appearance alone.\n7. Pot calls the kettle black/五十步笑百步 (Wǔshí bù xiào bǎi bù)\nThe Chinese idiom “五十步笑百步” also comes from a Chinese fable. The story is that, one day during a battle, two soldiers started running away from the frontline. The solder who ran away only fifty steps started making fun of the one who ran a hundred steps for not being brave. Both these phrases are used to poke fun at people who hypocritically criticize others, even though they have made the same mistake.\n8. Rome wasn’t built in a day/一口吃不成胖子 (Yīkǒu chī bùchéng pàngzi)\nThis Chinese idiom is my favorite of the bunch. The literal translation is: “You can’t get fat from just one bite.”(This is also what I tell myself when I see my favorite Chinese foods, but that’s a story for another day.)\nSimilar to “Rome wasn’t built in a day,” these two phrases both assure people that time, patience, and consistent effort are needed to achieve big results.\nFunny netizens in China made a play on this popular Chinese idiom by tackling on a second half of the phrase, “…一口吃不成胖子 而胖子却是一口一口吃出来的,” which means “You can’t get fat from just one bite, but fat is built up one bite at a time.”\nWhich one of these idioms is your favorite? Do you have any other favorite idioms to share?","- Understand the pros and cons of individual and group decision making.\n- Learn to recognize the signs of groupthink.\n- Recognize different tools and techniques for making better decisions.\nWhen It Comes to Decision Making, Are Two Heads Better Than One?\nThe answer to this question depends on several factors. Group decision making has the advantage of drawing from the experiences and perspectives of a larger number of individuals. Hence, a group may have the potential to be more creative and lead to more effective decisions. In fact, groups may sometimes achieve results beyond what they could have done as individuals. Groups may also make the task more enjoyable for the members. Finally, when the decision is made by a group rather than a single individual, implementation of the decision will be easier, because group members will be more invested in the decision. If the group is diverse, better decisions may be made, because different group members may have different ideas based on their backgrounds and experiences. Research shows that for top management teams, diverse groups that debate issues make decisions that are more comprehensive and better for the bottom line (Simons, Pelled, & Smith, 1999).\nDespite its popularity within organizations, group decision making suffers from a number of disadvantages. We know that groups rarely outperform their best member (Miner, 1984). While groups have the potential to arrive at an effective decision, they often suffer from process losses. For example, groups may suffer from coordination problems. Anyone who has worked with a team of individuals on a project can attest to the difficulty of coordinating members’ work or even coordinating everyone’s presence in a team meeting. Furthermore, groups can suffer from groupthink. Finally, group decision making takes more time compared to individual decision making, because all members need to discuss their thoughts regarding different alternatives.\nThus, whether an individual or a group decision is preferable will depend on the specifics of the situation. For example, if there is an emergency and a decision needs to be made quickly, individual decision making might be preferred. Individual decision making may also be appropriate if the individual in question has all the information needed to make the decision and if implementation problems are not expected. On the other hand, if one person does not have all the information and skills needed to make a decision, if implementing the decision will be difficult without the involvement of those who will be affected by the decision, and if time urgency is more modest, then decision making by a group may be more effective.\nFigure 11.11 Advantages and Disadvantages of Different Levels of Decision Making\n|Individual Decision Making||Group Decision Making|\n|Typically faster than group decision making||Fewer ideas||Diversity of ideas and can piggyback on others’ ideas||Takes longer|\n|Best individual in a group usually outperforms the group||Identifying the best individual can be challenging||Greater commitment to ideas||Group dynamics such as groupthink can occur|\n|Accountability is easier to determine||Possible to put off making decisions if left alone to do it||Interaction can be fun and serves as a teambuilding task||Social loafing–harder to identify responsibility for decisions|\nHave you ever been in a decision-making group that you felt was heading in the wrong direction but you didn’t speak up and say so? If so, you have already been a victim of groupthink. Groupthink is a tendency to avoid a critical evaluation of ideas the group favors. Iriving Janis, author of a book called Victims of Groupthink, explained that groupthink is characterized by eight symptoms (Janis, 1972):\n- Illusion of invulnerability is shared by most or all of the group members, which creates excessive optimism and encourages them to take extreme risks.\n- Collective rationalizations occur, in which members downplay negative information or warnings that might cause them to reconsider their assumptions.\n- An unquestioned belief in the group’s inherent morality occurs, which may incline members to ignore ethical or moral consequences of their actions.\n- Stereotyped views of outgroups are seen when groups discount rivals’ abilities to make effective responses.\n- Direct pressure is exerted on any members who express strong arguments against any of the group’s stereotypes, illusions, or commitments.\n- Self-censorship occurs when members of the group minimize their own doubts and counterarguments.\n- Illusions of unanimity occur, based on self-censorship and direct pressure on the group. The lack of dissent is viewed as unanimity.\n- The emergence of self-appointed mindguards happens when one or more members protect the group from information that runs counter to the group’s assumptions and course of action.\nOB Toolbox: Recommendations for Avoiding Groupthink\n- Groups should do the following:\n- Discuss the symptoms of groupthink and how to avoid them.\n- Assign a rotating devil’s advocate to every meeting.\n- Invite experts or qualified colleagues who are not part of the core decision-making group to attend meetings and get reactions from outsiders on a regular basis and share these with the group.\n- Encourage a culture of difference where different ideas are valued.\n- Debate the ethical implications of the decisions and potential solutions being considered.\n- Individuals should do the following:\n- Monitor personal behavior for signs of groupthink and modify behavior if needed.\n- Check for self-censorship.\n- Carefully avoid mindguard behaviors.\n- Avoid putting pressure on other group members to conform.\n- Remind members of the ground rules for avoiding groupthink if they get off track.\n- Group leaders should do the following:\n- Break the group into two subgroups from time to time.\n- Have more than one group work on the same problem if time and resources allow it. This makes sense for highly critical decisions.\n- Remain impartial and refrain from stating preferences at the outset of decisions.\n- Set a tone of encouraging critical evaluations throughout deliberations.\n- Create an anonymous feedback channel through which all group members can contribute if desired.\nSources: Adapted and expanded from Janis, I. L. (1972). Victims of groupthink. New York: Houghton Mifflin; Whyte, G. (1991). Decision failures: Why they occur and how to prevent them. Academy of Management Executive, 5, 23–31.\nTools and Techniques for Making Better Decisions\nNominal Group Technique (NGT) was developed to help with group decision making by ensuring that all members participate fully. NGT is not a technique to be used routinely at all meetings. Rather, it is used to structure group meetings when members are grappling with problem solving or idea generation. It follows four steps (Delbecq, Van de Ven, & Gustafson, 1975). First, each member of the group begins by independently and silently writing down ideas. Second, the group goes in order around the room to gather all the ideas that were generated. This process continues until all the ideas are shared. Third, a discussion takes place around each idea, and members ask for and give clarification and make evaluative statements. Finally, group members vote for their favorite ideas by using ranking or rating techniques. Following the four-step NGT helps to ensure that all members participate fully, and it avoids group decision-making problems such as groupthink.\nDelphi Technique is unique because it is a group process using written responses to a series of questionnaires instead of physically bringing individuals together to make a decision. The first questionnaire asks individuals to respond to a broad question such as stating the problem, outlining objectives, or proposing solutions. Each subsequent questionnaire is built from the information gathered in the previous one. The process ends when the group reaches a consensus. Facilitators can decide whether to keep responses anonymous. This process is often used to generate best practices from experts. For example, Purdue University Professor Michael Campion used this process when he was editor of the research journal Personnel Psychology and wanted to determine the qualities that distinguished a good research article. Using the Delphi technique, he was able to gather responses from hundreds of top researchers from around the world and distill them into a checklist of criteria that he could use to evaluate articles submitted to his journal, all without ever having to leave his office (Campion, 1993).\nMajority rule refers to a decision-making rule in which each member of the group is given a single vote and the option receiving the greatest number of votes is selected. This technique has remained popular, perhaps due to its simplicity, speed, ease of use, and representational fairness. Research also supports majority rule as an effective decision-making technique (Hastie & Kameda, 2005). However, those who did not vote in favor of the decision will be less likely to support it.\nConsensus is another decision-making rule that groups may use when the goal is to gain support for an idea or plan of action. While consensus tends to require more time, it may make sense when support is needed to enact the plan. The process works by discussing the issues at hand, generating a proposal, calling for consensus, and discussing any concerns. If concerns still exist, the proposal is modified to accommodate them. These steps are repeated until consensus is reached. Thus, this decision-making rule is inclusive, participatory, cooperative, and democratic. Research shows that consensus can lead to better accuracy (Roch, 2007), and it helps members feel greater satisfaction with decisions (Mohammed & Ringseis, 2001). However, groups take longer with this approach, and if consensus cannot be reached, members tend to become frustrated (Peterson, 1999).\nOB Toolbox: Perform a Project “Premortem”\nDoctors routinely perform postmortems to understand what went wrong with a patient who has died. The idea is for everyone to learn from the unfortunate outcome so that future patients will not meet a similar fate. But what if you could avoid a horrible outcome before it happened by proactively identifying project risks? Research has shown that the simple exercise of imagining what could go wrong with a given decision can increase people’s ability to correctly identify reasons for future successes or failures by 30% (Mitchell, Russo, & Pennington, 1989). A “premortem” is a way to imagine what might go wrong and avoid it before spending a cent or having to change course along the way. Gary Klein, an expert on decision making in fast-paced, uncertain, complex, and critical environments, recommends that decision makers follow a five-step process to increase their chances of success.\n- A planning team comes up with an outline of a plan, such as the launching of a new product.\n- Either the existing group or a unique group is then told to imagine looking into a crystal ball and seeing that the new product failed miserably. They then write down all the reasons they can imagine that might have led to this failure. Each team member shares items from their list until all the potential problems have been identified.\n- The list is reviewed for additional ideas.\n- The issues are sorted into categories in the search for themes.\n- The plan should then be revised to correct the flaws and avoid these potential problems.\nThis technique allows groups to truly delve into “what if” scenarios. For example, in a premortem session at a Fortune 500 company, an executive imagined that a potential billion-dollar environmental sustainability project might fail because the CEO had retired.\nSources: Breen, B.

Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates.\nGroup Decision Support Systems (GDSS) are interactive computer-based systems that are able to combine communication and decision technologies to help groups make better decisions. Research shows that a GDSS can actually improve the output of groups’ collaborative work through higher information sharing (Lam & Schaubroeck, 2000). Organizations know that having effective knowledge management systems to share information is important, and their spending reflects this reality. Businesses invested $2.7 billion into new systems in 2002, and projections were for this number to double every 5 years. As the popularity of these systems grows, they risk becoming counterproductive. Humans can only process so many ideas and information at one time. As virtual meetings grow larger, it is reasonable to assume that information overload can occur and good ideas will fall through the cracks, essentially recreating a problem that the GDSS was intended to solve, which is to make sure every idea is heard. Another problem is the system possibly becoming too complicated. If the systems evolve to a point of uncomfortable complexity, it has recreated the problem. Those who understand the interface will control the narrative of the discussion, while those who are less savvy will only be along for the ride (Nunamaker et al., 1991). Lastly, many of these programs fail to take into account the factor of human psychology. These systems could make employees more reluctant to share information because of lack of control, lack of immediate feedback, or the fear of online “flames.”\nDecision trees are diagrams in which answers to yes or no questions lead decision makers to address additional questions until they reach the end of the tree. Decision trees are helpful in avoiding errors such as framing bias (Wright & Goodwin, 2002). Decision trees tend to be helpful in guiding the decision maker to a predetermined alternative and ensuring consistency of decision making—that is, every time certain conditions are present, the decision maker will follow one course of action as opposed to others if the decision is made using a decision tree.\nThere are trade-offs between making decisions alone and within a group. Groups have a greater diversity of experiences and ideas than individuals, but they also have potential process losses such as groupthink. Groupthink can be avoided by recognizing the eight symptoms discussed. Finally, there are a variety of tools and techniques available for helping to make more effective decisions in groups, including the nominal group technique, Delphi technique, majority rule, consensus, GDSS, and decision trees.\n- Do you prefer to make decisions in a group or alone? What are the main reasons for your preference?\n- Have you been in a group that used the brainstorming technique? Was it an effective tool for coming up with creative ideas? Please share examples.\n- Have you been in a group that experienced groupthink? If so, how did you deal with it?\n- Which of the decision-making tools discussed in this chapter (NGT, Delphi, and so on) have you used? How effective were they?\nCampion, M. A. (1993).

{"question":"How do BrassiBase and the VIMS database differ in their approach to data liability and accuracy guarantees - what disclaimers do they provide?","answer":"Both databases include liability disclaimers but phrase them differently. BrassiBase explicitly states it 'does not warrant or assume any legal liability or responsibility for the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of any information, apparatus, product, or process disclosed.' The VIMS database, while noting they conduct extensive QA/QC, acknowledges some identification/coding errors may exist and states that 'VIMS and the Multispecies Research Group take no responsibility for the users' use or misuse of these data.'","context":["BrassiBase is a developing knowledge system for Brassicaceae taxonomy, systematics, evolution, and available germplasm resources and specimen collections. The knowledge base includes cross-referenced information on acurate enumeration of all species, genera and tribes, chromosome numbers, genome sizes, morphological characters, and biological traits.\nBiological, molecular and evolutionary knowledge about the mustard family increases constantly. However, due to the complex and overwhelmingly large biological diversity of the family, it is difficult to assess research results within a larger evolutionary framework. Many species have been proven to be remarkable study objects but are rarely available. Biological material and resources, either collected directly in the wild or held in germplasm collections, have often been taxonomically misidentified; and only very rarely has the material been further characterized and documented. There is also no comprehensive survey of morphological character and biological trait distribution among Brassicaceae lineages, though family-wide phylogenies are meanwhile available. In order to close these gaps, we will make accessible to the scientific community the research data focusing on adaptive characters and their evolution in the Brassicaceae. In this context, we will also provide a comprehensive documentation of the taxonomy and systematics of the entire family. This will include a database with all relevant taxonomic, systematic and phylogenetic literature, a comprehensive data collection of characters, a DNA-based identification tool for genera and species, electronic interactive keys for the identification of genera and species, and a setup of a carefully selected and documented germplasm collection representing main lineages of the family. BrassiBase has been launched within the framework of the DFG (German Research Foundation) priority program SPP 1529 “Adaptomics − Evolutionary plant solutions to ecological challenges/Molecular mechanisms underlying adaptive traits in the Brassicaceae s.l.”.\nThe first release of the database (version 1.1, June 2012) has been announced in a Special Issue of Taxon (Vol. 61, 2012), dedicated to Brassicaceae (= Cruciferae) and Brassicales (= Capparales) systematics and taxonomy. This earlier version of the database introduced the underlying taxonomic framework.\nThe second release (version 1.1.9, August 2013) build on the taxonomic content of version 1.1, incorporated taxonomic information into a “Taxonomy Tool” and implemented two major new features,the “Phylogenetics” and the “Cytogenetics Tool”. We kindly ask to cite the paper(s) given in the references section below whenever you extract respective information or obtain material from BrassiBase.\nThe third release (version 1.2, August 2017) bases on a completely revised species checklist serving as “taxonomic backbone”, an interactive determination key and a new “Morphology Tool” is allowing to explore the morphological diversity of the Brassicaceae family.\n- Koch MA, Kiefer M, German DA, Al-Shehbaz IA, Franzke A, Mummenhoff K, Schmickl R. 2012.

The University Heidelberg Botanic Garden therefore expects its part- ners in acquiring, maintaining, and transferring plant material to always act in accordance with the CBD and the Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES).\nThe responsibility for legal handling of the plant material passes on to the recipient upon receipt of the material. The re- quested plant material will be supplied to the recipient only on the following conditions:\n- Based on this agreement, the plant material is supplied only for non-commercial use such as scientific study and educational purposes as well as environmental protection. Should the recipient at a later date intend a commercial use or a transfer for commercial use, the country of origin‘s prior informed consent (PIC) must be obtained in writing before the material is used or transferred. The recipient is responsible for ensuring an equitable sharing of benefits.\n- On receiving the plant material, the recipient endeavours to document the received plant material, its origin (country of origin, first receiving garden, „donor“ of the plant material, year of collection) as well as the acquisition and transfer conditions in a comprehensible manner.\n- In the event that scientific publications are produced based on the supplied plant material, the recipient is ob- liged to indicate the origin of the material (the supplying garden and if known the country of origin) and to send these publications to the garden and to the country of origin without request.\n- On request, the garden will forward relevant information on the transfer of the plant material to the body char- ged with implementing the CBD2.\n- The recipient may transfer the received plant material to third parties only under these terms and conditions and must document the transfer in a suitable manner (e.g. by using the documentation form, such as provided in Annex 1.3).\nOur seed packets will be limited within Europe to 100 g, outside Europe to 50 g.\nNon IPEN members have to return the agreement on the previous page signed by an entitled repre- sentative of their institution before we can provide seeds to them!\nI accept the above conditions.\n1 According to the CBD “genetic resources” means genetic material of actual or potential value.

As described on other pages (ChesMMAP Info, NEAMAP info, NEAMAP Page at ASMFC ) ChesMMAP and NEAMAP conduct operations in Chesapeake Bay, and in the nearshore Atlantic Ocean between Cape Cod and Cape Hatteras, respectively.\nThe data base you are about to access is based on analyses of approximately 60,000 fish stomachs (as of August 2015), about evenly split between the two programs. New specimens are added to the group’s data base nearly every day.\nResults you will select are not based on accessing this ‘raw’ data base of individual specimen examinations. Instead, you will select data that result from specific analyses and summarizations of the raw data. Data are offered in this way because of the complex sampling, subsampling, and analysis methods employed on these surveys. Specifically, we sample stations according to a stratified random sampling regime, we subsample specimens for stomach analysis using methods to assure adequate sampling across all sizes, and we analyze the results based on an assumption of ‘cluster sampling’ as explained below and as described by Buckel (1999). All of these factors must be accounted for when analyzing these raw data. So, to provide users with the quickest response times, the data base you will access represents pre-summarized data. Full descriptions of collection and data analysis methodologies are explained in our project reports (ChesMMAP Reports and NEAMAP Reports).\nIt is important to understand the cluster sampling analysis methods mentioned above. This concept assumes that fish are not randomly distributed throughout their habitat but concentrate themselves in time and space according to size groups, habitat types, prey concentrations, and other factors. It further assumes that the specimens you sample at one location are more likely to be similar to each other than they would be to specimens sampled at another location or at a different time. Therefore, traditional summarization of data based on an assumption of a random distribution would be inappropriate. Let’s look at a hypothetical, though potentially very real, example. Assume we sampled striped bass in two locations. At the first we captured five fish and at the second we caught 100. At both locations our subsampling protocols state that we will examine the stomachs of five specimens. If we were to simply add up the weights (or numbers) of prey in the stomachs of each group of five we would not be giving proper consideration to the fact that at one site we caught 20 times the number of fish that we did at the other. The same concept holds for different sizes of fish captured within and among sampling stations. On a population level, we believe that we must account for such differences in order to properly describe the food habits of the fishes we are sampling. A real example can help illustrate the differences in analytical methods and why they are important:\nOur overall ChesMMAP (i.e. all ages, all locations, all years) diet summaries for striped bass show that about 9% of the diet by weight consists of Atlantic menhaden. This differs substantially from other food habits studies of striped bass in Chesapeake Bay (Griffin et. al 2003, Hartman and 1995, Walter et. al 2003). If we were to treat our data without regard to the cluster sampling assumptions (i.e. simply add up the total weight of menhaden in striped bass stomachs and divide by the total weight of all prey items), which is the traditional way that diet studies have analyzed their data, menhaden would contribute about 40% by weight to the diet of striped bass (other factors such as sampling methods, times, and locations likely account for this specific difference as well).\nAs previously stated, under these cluster sampling assumptions, fish captured together are assumed to be more similar to one another than they would be to fish captured elsewhere or at a different time. In effect, the cluster becomes the sampling unit rather than the individual specimen. For this reason, when reporting on sample size, it is more appropriate to report the number of clusters sampled than the number of individual fish stomachs examined. Both figures are provided on the data reports you will obtain.\nPredator-Centered Data Retrieval\nThe data base offers you the opportunity to choose to retrieve fish food habits analyses from either a predator or prey point of view. If you choose to view data from the predator’s perspective you can select data by Survey, Predator Species, Year, Age, and State, summarized by either prey weight or prey numbers (we do not currently offer online summaries by frequency of occurrence though such data are available by request). Once you enter the site you will see the following screen:\nWithin the “Predator-Centered Data Retrieval” simply make your choices within each drop-down box, hit the submit button, and you will be presented with a food habits report that looks like this:\nIn the report, data for prey types are presented first by major taxonomic group (e.g. fishes, crustaceans, molluscs, worms, etc.) in decreasing group order by percent consumed, and then within each major group by specific prey items, also in decreasing order. In some cases, prey types at the prey item level are grouped, even if more detailed data may be available in our raw data base. For example, data for all amphipod species are combined in these reports even if species-specific data may be available. More detailed summaries may be obtained upon request. For each major group, only specific prey items which represent 1.0% or more of the diet are presented individually. All prey types that are less than 1.0% are grouped into an ‘xxxxxxxx – other’ category where ‘xxxxxxxx’ represents the taxonomic group.\nA few conditions in the predator-based data retrieval system require explanation:\n- The first choice you will make when selecting your data will be to pick from which survey you wish to see data (ChesMMAP or NEAMAP). After that, you will select a predator species, then, you can make choices for Year, Age, and State if such data are available for the species of interest. You must also choose whether you want data summarized by prey weight or prey number. Choices in the drop-down boxes are linked such that values presented in each field are filtered based on your choices in previous fields (this fixes a bug that existed in earlier versions of the data base). However, you must make your choices for Year, Age, and State in that order so that the filtering works as expected.\n- Similarly, when making selections for Year, Age, and State, at least one of these choices must be ‘All’ or no data will be returned. While in many cases data may exist in our raw data base to allow such specific analyses to be accomplished, in general the sample sizes would be too small to offer reliable estimates of diet.\n- In the drop-down list for predator Ages you may see a figure of -1. This is a special circumstance which only exists in the data base for Atlantic croaker. It results from differences in spawning patterns in the northern (Chesapeake Bay) portion of the species’ range which make it possible for us to capture specimens in the fall of the year preceding their official birth date of 1 January. In our data bases these specimens are assigned an age of -1 so that the proper year class can be calculated.\nPrey-Centered Data Retrieval\nThe choices available to view data from the prey perspective are much simpler. The only menu choice available is to select the prey species for which you want to retrieve data. The data report is also simplified, listing all predator species in which the prey appears and the percent of the overall diet, both by number and weight (for All Years, All Ages, All States), separately for each Survey. Sample size measurements (from the predator side) are also listed. Percentages listed in this report DO NOT add up in any meaningful way. Researchers are encouraged to use the information on this report to explore more deeply in the predator-based query system.\nAs explained above, data are being added to our raw food habits data base on a daily basis. We will update this online version of our data periodically (2-4 times per year) and without notice. Therefore, results that you download today may differ somewhat from results using the same menu choices that you obtain in the future. You should make note of the date listed at the bottom of the data report.\nCurrently, the application only allows users to view or print out the data report. You may be able to select the report text and copy and paste into an application such as MS Word but formatting changes are likely to make the resulting document difficult to view. If there is sufficient demand we may make results available in the future in spreadsheet or other more copy-able form.\nWe ask that all uses of this data base be given proper credit and citation.

{"question":"Why are gene banks important for protecting wild fish species?","answer":"Gene banks are vital for protecting wild fish species because they provide genetic backup for original genetic stock and specific genetic variations. For example, if a river needs to be disinfected due to parasitic outbreaks like Gyrodactylus Salaris (which kills all fish), the original genetic source can be preserved and later reintroduced. Gene banks also allow returning to specific points in a species' genetic history if breeding programs drift away from desired outcomes, and enable crossing specific traits between males and females to produce offspring with desired characteristics.","context":["GLOBAL - Cryogenetics is helping to increase fish numbers through its milt preservation and fertilisation technology, and also through its diverse gene bank. These services can offer assistance to both aquaculture and wild fish stocks, writes Lucy Towers, TheFishSite Editor.\nAs innovators and industry leaders in cryopreservation of aquatic genetics, the company’s biggest service is the cryopreservation of milt. This technology freezes the milt at extremely low temperatures so that it does not degrade, allowing it to be used at a later date when it is needed for fertilization.\nThe ability to cryopreserve milt is a valuable tool for hatcheries. As well as this, hatcheries can also improve their fish through Cryogenetics’ improved fertilization service.\nThe company is able to maximise the available output of a population through precise measurement.\n“Our SDM6 Photometer measures sperm density precisely in billions of sperm cells per ml of milt. We know that it only takes one sperm to fertilise an egg but in the natural world, there are many millions of sperm cells made available for each egg. In hatcheries traditionally you would find a sperm to egg ration of 4-6 million which is more than enough to do the job. We take that precise measurement and through careful dilution, we can take that ratio down to 1.5 million sperm cells per egg,” explained Russell Ferguson, Aquaculture Manager for Cryogenetics.\n“This means that the milt available can be used for 3 or 4 times as many eggs. This is very significant where you have few elite males and you want to grow your populations with the best genetic material.”\nCryogenetics stores the cryopreserved milt in containers called “SquarePacks®”. These quick thawing containers hold the exact amount of frozen milt to fertilise the same number of eggs each time, thereby offering consistency of results and allows for good planning.\nIn terms of fertilization, Cryogenetics has a range of products that help improve the fertilisation results of many freshwater and marine species.\nThe AquaBoost® range of products to maximize and improve fertilisation includes; dilutors to get the perfect sperm to egg ratio, activators to “turbocharge” the sperm cells and extenders to keep sperm fresh for several weeks.\nAlongside its fertilisation work, Cryogenetics also offers gene banking.\nGene banking is a vital resource that allows a genetic back up for original genetic stock and back-up for a specific genetic enhancement or variation.\nMr Ferguson explained: “If there is a parasitic outbreak such as Gyrodactylus Salaris in a river, then the river is disinfected and all fish species will be killed. By removing the salmon milt before the river is treated and freezing it, when the river is ready to sustain healthy fish again, the original genetic source can be returned.”\nSimilarly, milt can also be frozen until it is needed when eggs become available. It also allows for specific milt from a male to be crossed with specific traits from a female to produce offspring that have all the traits that you are looking for.\nMost importantly, Cryogenetics’ gene banking offers the ability to return a species to a desired point in its genetic history.\nIt provides the assurance that you can return to a specific point in time with the preferred genetic and trait selection.\nThis is a very useful tool as breeding programmes can occasionally drift too far away from the desired outcome, explained Mr Ferguson. It therefore allows you to return to your chosen route.\nOperating in Canada, the UK, USA, Chile and Norway, the company can collect, freeze and store sperm from: Atlantic salmon, coho salmon, chinook salmon, sockeye salmon, rainbow trout, brown trout, brook trout, Arctic char, sablefish, halibut, zebra fish, lumpsucker and several more species.\nWild Fish Enhancement\nThese services offered by Cryogenetics are not only useful to fish farms, they are also fundamental to the enhancement of wild fish stocks.\nEnhancement aquaculture is an important management tool for rescuing or building up stocks of wild fish that are under threat or for helping repopulate areas which may have lost fish populations through disease, overfishing, habitat destruction or other environmental challenges.\nAlso called restoration aquaculture, enhancement aquaculture is all about enhancement of fish or shellfish stocks by releasing into the wild juveniles that have been raised in hatcheries.\nHatcheries capture adult fish in the wild that are ready to spawn and strip them of sperm and eggs, and then where possible, release the adults back into the water systems.\nThe eggs are then fertilised and developed in the hatchery. When the juveniles become an appropriate size they are then released into the wild.\nAs well as giving the fish a good start, Cryogenetics’ work also makes sure that the fish they release are optimum in terms of their performance, fitness and genetic make-up to suit the changing environment.\nExplaining the benefits of raising the juveniles in the hatchery, Mr Ferguson stated: “In the wild, the most vulnerable stage of the fish life cycle is during the period from egg to juvenile. Enhancement hatcheries therefore offer increased survival rates for the juvenile stage as the fish and environment in the hatchery are closely monitored; there is abundant food containing the correct nutritional requirements and most importantly, there are no predators.”\nCryogenetics is currently carrying out this important restoration work in various locations across the world.\nIn Italy, the company has been working for several years with a government sponsored stock recovery programme to help recover stocks of marble trout (Salmo marmoratus) whose genetic purity is at threat due to its breeding with native brown trout.\n“Through working closely with the programme, we were able to select pure species males and females from the populations and apply our products and techniques to improve the fertilisation rate and juvenile output by many thousands,” explained Mr Ferguson.\n“We also cryopreserved sperm from the species so that it can be used in subsequent fertilisations. This acts not only as a fertilisation tool but also as “insurance” within a gene bank in case the population is threatened further. To date in our gene bank, we have sufficient milt from a whole range of males to reproduce in excess of 150,000 juveniles of sufficient biodiversity to maintain a healthy population.”\nSimilarly, Cryogenetics is also working with tribes of the First Nations on the west coast of Canada to help conserve Pacific salmon.\n“The pacific salmon have particular cultural significance within the First Nations and they have consulted with us to enhance the population as well secure the future of the species through improved fertilisation and cryopreservation of genetic material,” explained Mr Ferguson.\n“Through creating larger and stronger populations of Pacific salmon, they will return year after year to spawn in the same river system and this helps to create year-round valuable employment for First Nation people.”\nFor more information on Cryogenetics and its products, please visit http://www.cryogenetics.com/"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a11ac0e3-5ed5-4085-8c64-487e0439fb59>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the fundamental data access patterns between LucidLink's object storage approach and conventional block storage in terms of data retrieval efficiency?","answer":"LucidLink's object storage approach uses a unique data layout that allows for random read access and data streaming, where data is retrieved in specific blocks (default 256KiB) only when required, eliminating the need to retrieve entire files. In contrast, conventional block storage works by having users define volumes with fixed-size blocks of storage capacity, where volumes appear as single drives to the server's operating system. These blocks, once in use, are sometimes difficult to adjust, requiring users to anticipate data growth when allocating volume to an application. Both systems aim for efficient data retrieval but use different methods: LucidLink through selective block streaming, and block storage through direct volume access.","context":["LucidLink is a log-structured distributed file system for object storage. LucidLink writes to object storage using a unique data layout which allows random read access and data streaming. Our data layout is not a traditional 1:1 file-to-object relationship, objects are laid out to match a specific block size. One file could consist of multiple objects, depending on the file size and block size (default 256KiB). In some cases you may want to choose a different block size depending on your use case.\nA Filespace leverages metadata coordination and synchronization to make requests on individual blocks within the object store. This dramatically improves performance as we don't need to retrieve data not yet required. The result is, when data is read, we don't always need to read the whole file and all objects. We can stream only the data required, when the application or user requires it.\nEqually. When it comes to writing, we create new objects for fresh data, and garbage collect expired objects. Objects within the object store are encrypted and compressed at the client-side, therefore cannot be accessed from the object store directly.\nIf the default 256KiB block size doesn't suit your data type, you can initialize a Filespace with a preferred block size.

The terms “file” and “block” refer to the way data is stored, managed and accessed on the storage media, such as hard disk drives, solid-state drives or tape. File and block are access protocols that use different methods to save and retrieve data.\nFile storage is associated with unstructured data. Unstructured data is data that may be at variable lengths, with files that don’t necessarily have common formats or features that allow for the data to be arranged in a meaningful, coherent and consistent fashion. Some examples of file data include word processing documents, presentations, email messages, videos and graphics.\nBlock data isn’t file oriented, but rather consists of chunks of data that comprise databases and other data forms that have specific structures that define each data segment by its constituents. Block data is often represented in columns and rows. A row represents a single entity, while a column defines the contents of that entity. Rows are generally referred to as “records” and columns as “fields.”\nHow Does File Storage Work?\nBoth file storage and block storage are forms of data virtualization because they provide organization and a management layer that operates above the storage media’s native management system.\nFile storage devices manage the data they hold centrally, using a file system interface, such as Windows File Explorer or Apple’s Finder utility on Macs. The data that comprises a single file as recognized by a word processing application, for instance, may in fact consist of many pieces that are spread across a drive or multiple drives. The file system maintains pointers that indicate the locations of those pieces. The system can then enable the assembly of those pieces in the proper order to present the full file.\nThe file system also stores metadata for each file. Metadata is basic information that helps to identify the file and includes file name, the size of the file, the date the file was created and when it was last modified. Files are listed in hierarchical fashion within multiple levels of folders.\nIn addition to the way data is stored on individual PCs, file storage is the main type of storage used for shared storage called network-attached storage, or NAS. NAS systems allow multiple servers and the users they support to access a defined share of a centralized storage pool.\nFile storage on NAS systems typically supports file access protocols such as network file system (NFS), which is native to Linux and Linux applications, and server message block (SMB) -- previously called common internet file system (CIFS) -- for Windows servers and the applications they host.\nHow Does Block Storage Work?\nBlock storage doesn’t overlay the inner workings of a drive to the degree that file storage does. It is more closely functionally related to the underlying native drive management system that controls the storage media. As such, block storage isn’t file oriented and maintains much less metadata for the storage it manages.\nWith block storage, users define volumes with blocks of storage capacity. To the server’s operating system and applications, a volume looks like a single drive. The blocks have a fixed size and are sometimes difficult to adjust once they are in use, so when allocating a volume to an application, users should anticipate data growth and make the appropriate allowances.\nBlock is the type of storage used in storage area networks (SANs), which are shared storage resources accessible by many servers and applications. SANs are similar in concept to NAS systems, but typically host only block storage. Originally, SANs required their own specialized networking protocol, Fibre Channel (FC), which was developed specifically for networked storage. FC networks use different network interface cards, switches and other gear than Ethernet networks, so SANs that support block storage were typically built around their own specialized infrastructure.\nIn 2004, that restriction eased somewhat with the publication of the Internet Small Computer Systems Interface (iSCSI) standard. ISCSI allowed shared block storage systems to use conventional TCP/IP networks so that the same Ethernet components that connected servers and users could be used to attach those assets to shared block storage. About five years later, another storage networking protocol -- Fibre Channel over Ethernet (FCoE) -- was introduced. FCoE retained some of the performance aspects of FC but could run over a standard Ethernet network.\nWhat Are the Benefits of File Storage?\nFile storage is familiar to anyone who has used a computer. It’s easy to use and readily accessible by a broad range of applications, including popular productivity apps like Microsoft Office.\nAs the basis for a shared storage resource -- NAS systems -- file storage offers relatively easy management with a minimum of administrative tasks required to make storage available to users and applications. And because NAS can use existing Ethernet networking facilities to make the storage available, it does not require any special networking knowledge or specialized networking components.\nWhat Are the Benefits of Block Storage?\nBecause it operates close to native operations of the drives themselves, block storage usually performs at a higher level than file storage. That level of performance, combined with its block-based data access, makes block storage particularly suitable for databases. It is also suitable for other applications that use large amounts of data that is augmented and updated regularly.\nIn a disk drive block storage environment, even greater performance can be attained by short-stroking the disk drives. This involves using only the outer edges of the disks that move a faster clip than the inner parts so data can be written and retrieved more quickly. All-flash SAN arrays and flash-aided arrays are likely to produce even greater performance for block storage systems.\nWhat Are the Drawbacks of File Storage?\nThe main drawback to file storage is that file systems are limited in the number of files they can manage. That number will vary considerably from one system to the next, but the common trait is that when the limit is reached, the system will not be able to store any more data.\nFile systems are hierarchical, containing levels of folders and sub-folders that hold files that must be tracked, managed and updated with current metadata. By limiting the number of folders and files, the storage system can manage everything in a reasonably timely manner so that users and applications get access to data without major delays.\nIts hierarchical nature also limits files storage’s performance. While it may be possible to run modest databases and other non-office productivity applications on file storage, the performance might be insufficient for handling more challenging relational databases and related applications.\nWhat Are the Drawbacks of Block Storage?\nBlock is typically higher priced than file storage. A networked storage resource may require a special network to support Fibre Channel -- unless the block storage is part of an iSCSI SAN using traditional Ethernet networking protocols.\nManaging block storage in a SAN can be complicated and require more expertise than needed for NAS administration. Although most SAN vendors that sell block storage have simplified administrative procedures over the past decade, capacity allocation and overall management often remains complex.\nBlock storage also doesn’t attach as much metadata to the data it stores compared with file storage, so other tools may be needed to identify and manage stored data.\nUnified Storage: File Storage Coexists With Block Storage\nUnified storage systems combine file and block storage in a single storage resource. Because iSCSI block storage can use Ethernet protocols just as file storage does, it made it possible to provide both types of storage in a single shared resource. Later developments made it possible to include FC and FCoE storage protocols in unified storage systems.\nWith unified systems, users can decide how to allocate the storage capacity as either file or block. These systems are typically less expensive than block-only arrays, although block performance may not be at the same level of dedicated block storage appliances. But the flexibility to allocate resources as needed may outweigh the trade-off in performance.\nConclusion: Use Cases Determine File or Block Storage\nBoth file storage and block storage have been around for a while. They are both mature technologies that address specific data center needs. That’s true even as the storage media has evolved from spinning disks to flash-based solid-state drives. The choice of file vs. block depends on the intended use cases and expectations related to performance."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"future"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"language-ambiguous"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5316a8db-47d3-4794-a8ce-fca64e1718a3>","<urn:uuid:3f8402a5-7ce7-4a40-8900-c11e99b88ea3>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Could you explain how the Royal Navy's carrier capabilities have evolved historically, and what role do modern autonomous systems play in naval and aerial operations today?","answer":"The Royal Navy experienced a 10-year gap in aircraft carrier capabilities due to defense cuts before HMS Queen Elizabeth's introduction. The new carrier marks a 'new dawn' for Britain's naval power, continuing a long maritime tradition. The ship is designed to be in service for 50 years, with naval leadership predicting an increasing shift toward remotely-piloted drones. In terms of autonomous systems, modern drones represent a significant advancement in aerial operations, characterized by their ability to fly and operate autonomously without human pilots onboard. These unmanned aerial vehicles can achieve higher altitudes and longer operation times than traditional aircraft, while being controlled by remote and computer systems on the ground. They serve various functions including surveillance, data collection, and military missions, with some modern drones capable of operating at altitudes of 18,000 to 27,000 meters.","context":["Towering higher than Niagara Falls and dwarfing one of her predecessors docked alongside, the naming of Britain's biggest ever warship marked a \"new dawn\" in the nation's long and illustrious naval history.\nThe Queen said the Royal Navy's new supercarrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, should serve as a \"source of inspiration and pride\" as she officially christened the vessel.\nHMS Queen Elizabeth will finally enter service at the end of the decade, ending a 10 year gap where defence cuts have left the UK without an aircraft carrier.\nThe head of the Navy Admiral Sir George Zambellas said the official naming of what will be Britain’s biggest ever warship marked a “new dawn” for the nation’s security.\nThe Queen christened the ship on Friday by smashing a bottle of Islay malt whisky against the hull, rather than the traditional champagne.\nShe told the ceremony at Rosyth that her father had been told a background in the Royal Navy was the best preparation to be king.\nShe said: “Lord Mountbatten told my father on becoming king that 'there's no more fitting preparation to be king than to be trained in the Royal Navy'.\n\"My own personal associations, especially as the proud sponsor of six other warships and submarines, remind me that that reputation for excellence continues to this day.\n\"In sponsoring this new aircraft carrier I believe that Queen Elizabeth, as flagship for the Royal Navy, will be a source of inspiration and pride for us all.”\nThe Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge have both spent time in the Navy as part of their military careers. The Prince had command of his own ship, the minehunter HMS Bronington, in 1976, and was also a naval pilot. The Duke spent two months attached to the Navy in 2008.\nThe 65,000 ton HMS Queen Elizabeth is the first of two new aircraft carriers being built, in a £6.2 billion programme which has been dogged by soaring costs and controversy over the choice of fighter planes to carry.\nDavid Cameron, who also attended the naming ceremony, said the supercarrier will be the \"spearhead of British sea power for the next half Century\".\nHe added: “As a national instrument of power and influence, HMS Queen Elizabeth is not just an investment in the future of the Royal Navy and our defence.\nRed Arrows mark the naming of Royal Navy's new aircraft carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth (GETTY IMAGES)\n\"She is an investment in the future of British security, British prosperity and our country’s place in the world.”\nAs the RAF’s Red Arrows aerobatics display team flew overhead, the First Sea Lord said the ceremony heralded the “beginning of the next chapter for the Royal Navy and defence”.\nAdmiral Sir George Zambellas told a crowd of 4,000 at Rosyth Dockyard in Scotland: “She has presence, she dwarfs all, she’s most certainly fit for a Queen.”\n“She has risen as a steel-clad phoenix to give rebirth to our nation’s carrier strike capability.”\nSir George said the 919ft long ship would become a “national instrument of power, a national symbol of authority and that means she will be a national icon, helping to keep the great in Great Britain.”\nShe was joined for the ceremony by HMS Illustrious, which measures a mere 689ft and 22,000 tons.\nWhen HMS Queen Elizabeth is finished she will hold a crew of 680 and be able to house a fleet of up to 40 jets and helicopters, creating what admirals say is a piece of British territory that can be deployed around the globe.\nDespite the price, which has nearly doubled since the ships were first ordered, the Ministry of Defence says the ships still cost around the third of what America spends on carriers.\nThe ship will be home to Britain’s new F-35 Lightning II stealth fighters, but the ceremony had to make do with a full size model of an F-35 on the carrier’s ski jump, after an engine scare prevented a planned fly-past by the new jump jets.\nThe Pentagon announced it had grounded the F-35 fleet for engine checks after a US Air Force plane was badly damaged in an engine fire last week.\nThe fire now raises doubts over whether the F-35 will be able to cross the Atlantic in time for its scheduled UK debut at next week’s Royal International Air Tattoo.\nOnce built, the ship will be in service for 50 years. Sir George predicted that as technology developed, its aircraft would increasingly be remotely-piloted drones.\nHe said: “This is a piece of UK sovereign territory that the Government and our imagination can work with.”","The key distinction between drones and other aircraft is their ability to fly and operate autonomously, hence the name unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV). With neither the risks nor limitations of having a human onboard, drones can reach higher altitudes and operate for extended periods of time, while controls are “manned”, or monitored, by remotes and computer systems on the ground. The combination of autonomy and advanced technology has allowed drones to take on a variety of functions, such as carrying and delivering goods, surveilling areas of land, collecting data and capturing images for both military and civilian missions (1).\nEngineering a power source that can last for days/weeks and not burden the device with excessive weight is a constant challenge in aeronautics. Drones for civilian use are usually powered by removable battery packs that last for less than an hour before returning to the ground for replacement (2). Those used for extended surveillance and reconnaissance require much larger power sources to carry the weight of multi-rotors and actuators (i.e. cameras, weapons, radars, sensors), which in total can range from below 2kg and over 600kg (1). For high endurance missions lasting days or weeks, 80-90% of the gross weight is in fuel capacity and 10-20% of the weight in the actuators (1).\nSolar-powered drones have proven to be a much more efficient source of energy for drones traveling long distances and over extended periods of time. The use of solar cells not only offers a constant stream of energy to operate the vehicle, but also greatly reduces the overall weight. AeroVironment, a leading energy and aeronautics company in California, designed some of the most groundbreaking solar-powered aircrafts—Solar Challenger, Pathfinder, and Pathfinder-Plus (3). Although these were manned aircrafts, AeroVironment also has a division for unmanned aircraft systems, which may foreseeably be integrated with their solar-energy initiatives.\nSolar-powered drones still require research and experimentation before they can be fully implemented. However, the opportunities and benefits are clear and the industry has become increasingly competitive, with energy, aeronautic innovation, and even digital media companies involved. Solar Impulse is one company working towards clean energy aircrafts. Most recently, the company’s Solar Impulse 2 completed a 43,000 km flight on no fuel and solar energy alone. Bertrand Piccard, the 58-year-old seasoned pilot, told reporters, “We have shown that the plane could fly forever. The limit is the pilot.” (4) Facebook and Alphabet, Google’s parent company, are developing technologies in their projects known as Aquilas and Google Titan to deliver internet connection to any part of the world that still lacks access (5). These missions require devices to sustain itself at high altitudes, 18,000 to 27,000 meters above the ground, and adapt to unexpected weather conditions for a continuous 3 months; current tests remain far from the goal, as Aquila has flown up to 655 meters above ground and for a 96-minute period (6).\nThe vision for solar-powered drone technology has yet to be perfected and authorized under government regulation. As mentioned earlier, photovoltaic technology has proven to be sufficient for fueling aircrafts without interfering with the vehicles’ aerodynamics. However, the conditions for which drones are expected to experience include high pressure, extreme temperatures, and fluctuating weather conditions. With this in mind, researchers have identified that only 5 out of 20+ technologies (crystalline silicon (c-Si), gallium-arsenide (GaAs), amorphous silicon, copper-indium-gallium-selenide and thin gallium-arsenide based photovoltaics) can withstand the conditions described above (7). Furthermore, research around photovoltaic technology specifically for drones requires a different standard for measurements and data collection because the optimal solar panel for powering a drone is not necessarily the technology with the highest energy yield, but the highest power-to-mass and power-to-area ratios (PUAV) (7). Currently, solar-powered drone technology is somewhat dependent upon existing photovoltaic research, until more data can be collected and solar energy systems can be understood in collaboration with aerial vehicles.\nFinding a balance between mass and power sources in drone technology is not the only challenge that innovators are faced with. Researchers and engineers are also racing against the clock as more competition enters the industry and increasing government regulation is put in place. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) UAS Rule (Part 107), due to take effect on August 29th, 2016, limits vehicles’ weight at 25kg and altitude at 121.92 meters off the ground unless approved under a certificate of waiver (8). Increasing government regulations may hinder the progress in solar-powered drone research, especially for purposes of testing high endurance and high altitude vehicles. On the other hand, as more companies and organizations occupy the aerial landscape, partnerships across sectors will rise. Facebook and Alphabet are just two of many companies that have found opportunities through such partnerships.\nIncorporating solar energy with drone technology has shown benefits beyond providing clean energy. Solar-powered systems will allow vehicles to spend longer durations in the air and maintain constant surveillance, leading to greater data and accuracy of information collected. These aspects are appealing to industries that may not have had a part in drone technology before, like those in media or telecommunications. Although this new area of research may lead to some interferences from competitors and regulators, other businesses and governments can also offer great networks and opportunities for solar-powered drone technology.\n(1) Gupta, S., Ghonge, M., Jawandhiya, P.

Solar powered technology has been developing for decades, since the introduction of solar photovoltaics (PV), a medium of conductive materials (i.e. silicon, cadmium, gallium) designed to convert absorbed sunlight directly into electricity (1). Solar engineers later found that the alternate form of solar energy, radiant heat, could generate solar thermal electricity (STE) through concentrated solar power (CSP) technology. CSP structures are strategically placed to reflect and focus sunlight upon a “heat transfer fluid” (i.e. molten salt, synthetic oil), which then transfers the energy to an engine that produces electricity (1). Although solar technology has existed for several decades, solar engineers continue to make material, installation and distribution improvements on existing PV and CSP structures to stimulate and sustain growing demands for renewable solar technology.\nBetween solar PV and CSP technology, households and businesses prefer PV energy conversion systems because they are easier to install, show rapid returns on investment, and are compatible with existing policies/markets (1). CSP technology remains as a major source of renewable energy, but requires much more area and maintenance, making it most effective in arid climates.\nAt 2015 year-end, the worldwide capacity for solar PV was 227 gigawatts, approximately 185 million solar panels, while that of STE was 4.8 gigawatts (3). The U.S. alone increased capacity by more than 10 gigawatts in 2015 and totaled over 800,000 distributed PV systems installed (4). These trends were attained through technological advancement, as well as increasing dialogue around the subject of renewable energy in politics, businesses, and civil engineering. The past decade has shown rising numbers of operating solar energy systems in the U.S. and worldwide due to both scientific and systemic progress.\nMaterial and Manufacturing Improvements\nSolar CSP and PV systems are both constructed with large amounts of metal, where CSP structures have also shown a “high metal depletion burden”, “greater than for other power generators” (1). PV systems generate the most waste during the manufacturing process of using crystalline silicon to build PV modules (1). Developments in solar technology materials and manufacturing processes are foreseeable, as it is in solar technology companies’ best interest to find alternative materials and designs that will increase efficiency and durability.\nSolar Energy Systems for the Long Haul\nSolar power systems’ variability to sun exposure, based on geography, climate, and date, is a continuous challenge for engineers. To account for periods and locations that receive minimal to zero sunlight, solar power engineers have experimented with different materials and chemicals’ power load capacities, battery and storage technology, and transmission systems (1). A broader approach is a systemic change that places solar and wind energy on the power grid, alongside existing electricity grids that are primarily powered by coal and fossil fuels, also known as system value (SV) (5).\nProgress in solar power technology has been driven by increasing awareness of climate change, initiatives to counter act global warming, and economic incentives through lower utility costs and public policy standards. Solar engineers are expected to meet the rising demands of government officials, consumers, and businesses by mid-century (5). Engineers and manufactures will be held responsible for increasing production in the coming years, while continuing to develop solar technology that will maximize energy efficiency, sustainability, and distribution.\n(1) Hertwich, E.G., Alosisi de Larderel, J., Arvesen, A., Bayer, P., Bergesen, J., Bouman, E., Gilbon, T., Heath, G., Pena, C., Purhit, P., Ramirez, A., Suh, S.

{"question":"How do the different coins placed on military graves symbolize different relationships with the deceased veteran?","answer":"Different coin denominations left at veteran graves have specific symbolic meanings: A penny indicates you knew and respected the deceased, a nickel means you attended basic training together, a dime signifies you served in the military together, and a quarter shows you were present when the deceased was killed.","context":["Join the Conversation\nTo find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs\nCoins on veterans' graves symbolize respect\nHave you ever visited a cemetery, seen coins on the graves of deceased military veterans and wondered what was the significance?\nWorld archaeology confirms that coins have played an important cultural role in connection with human burial rites since the earliest introduction of coinage during antiquity. One historic tradition of placing coins with a deceased can be traced back to ancient Greece.\nIn Greek mythology, Charon was the ferryman for the underworld of Hades. Charon ferried souls of the deceased across the River Styx that separated the upper world of the living from the lower world of the dead. To transport a loved one's soul across this river to the world of the dead, payment of a certain coin was required. The coin was customarily placed in the mouth or over the eye of the deceased.\nThe coin of passage was known as Charon's obol, one of the basic denominations of ancient Greek coins. The legend also provides that, if this coin fee was not paid, the deceased would be left to wander the shores of the river as a lonely ghost for one hundred years.\nThe placing of coins on the grave stones or markers of military men and women who gave their lives in the service of our nation is an American tradition.\nIt is a symbolic act of gratitude for the service and sacrifice of the deceased. It is also a way to show your visit to the grave site, your respect for the deceased, and your sympathy to the family of the deceased without directly contacting them.\nTraditionally, coins of different denominations left at veteran graves have the following special significance:\n- Penny - you knew and respected the deceased.\n- Nickel - you and the deceased attended basic training together.\n- Dime - you and the deceased served in the military together.\n- Quarter – you were present when the deceased was killed.\nMilitary veterans of the Vietnam War established a different but related tradition regarding coins. Coins would be left at the grave of a deceased comrade as the “down payment” on a promise to buy him or her a drink in the afterlife.\nNo matter what the individual intention of the coin-leaver might have been, a coin left on a grave site is always a symbol of respectful remembrance, and a way of telling all that the person buried there was visited.\nWhat happens to these coins?\nIt is the custom of most cemeteries to collect these coins periodically for designated purposes. Military cemeteries use them to help cover the costs of burial for veterans who cannot afford it. Civilian cemeteries normally apply them toward cemetery maintenance costs. At historic Belle Plaine Cemetery in Callahan County, the gathered coins are used to purchase small American flags placed on veterans' graves for its Memorial Day ceremony.\n“And I'm proud to be an American,\nwhere at least I know I'm free.\nAnd I won't forget the men who died,\nwho gave that right to me.”\n- Lee Greenwoood (American country music singer/songwriter and Grammy Award winner)\n“How important it is to recognize our heroes and she-roes!” - Maya Angelou (American poet/author, Pulitzer Prize winner and Presidential Medal of Freedom recipient)\nJohn Compere lives in Callahan County."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:40e0325b-46e8-4ee6-84ce-fb4b29556a00>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do tai chi and yoga twists differ in their philosophical approaches to achieving mind-body balance and wellness benefits?","answer":"Both practices approach mind-body balance differently while seeking wellness benefits. Yoga twists focus on a 'squeeze-and-soak' action that flushes out toxins and brings fresh blood to organs, while also maintaining spinal health through rotation of vertebrae and stretching of soft tissues. The practice emphasizes anatomical alignment and conscious movement through different sections of the spine. Tai chi, rooted in Taoist philosophy, emphasizes the interconnection of opposing forces (yin-yang) and teaches meeting force with softness rather than resistance. It focuses on continuous, flowing movements while maintaining deep body awareness, combining physical exercise with meditation. Both practices aim to reveal mind-body unity, but tai chi does so through constant, gentle motion while yoga uses specific held postures like twists.","context":["by Julie Gudmestad\nTwisting poses will help restore your spine’s natural range of motion, cleanse your organs, and stimulate circulation.\nTRY ASKING SOME non yogis what they think happens in a yoga class, and at least one will answer that people get “all twisted up like a pretzel.” In fact, we yogis do twist a lot in a well-rounded yoga practice: We twist while sitting, standing, and standing on our heads. Because there is such an intriguing variety of twists, you might guess that twists provide an abundance of benefits. And they do. There are physiological benefits to the circulatory system and internal organs, structural benefits to the musculoskeletal system, and focusing benefits to your consciousness.\nIndia yoga master B.K.S. Iyengar describes twists as a “squeeze-and-soak” action. The organs are compressed during a twist, flushing out blood filled with metabolic by-products and toxins. When we release the twist, fresh blood flows in, carrying oxygen and the building blocks for tissue healing. So from the physiological standpoint, twists stimulate circulation and have a cleansing and refreshing effect on the torso organs and associated glands.\nWhile these physiological benefits are undeniably valuable, this column will focus primarily on the functions of and benefits to muscles and joints used in twists. Yoga twists involve the spine, as well as several major joints, including the hips and shoulders. In fact, full range of motion in spinal rotation is essential to many yoga poses. Unfortunately, many people lose full spinal rotation in the course of living a sedentary lifestyle. Some losses can occur if joints fuse due to trauma, surgery, or arthritis, but most range of motion loss comes from the shortening of soft tissues. If you don’t lengthen the muscles, tendons, ligaments, and fascia (connective tissues) to their full length at least a few times a week, they will gradually shorten and limit the nearby joint’s mobility. In the case of twisting, the limitation is usually in soft tissues around the spine, abdomen, rib cage, and hips. If you regularly practice yoga twists, there are some clear benefits to these same joints and soft tissues. Not only do you maintain the normal length and resilience of the soft tissues, but you also help to maintain the health of the discs and facet joints (the small pair of joints on the back of the spine where each two vertebrae overlap).\nA Twist a Day\nTO MAINTAIN OR RESTORE the normal spinal rotation, I recommend that you practice a simple spinal twist once or twice a day. (Note: If you have a spinal disc injury, consult your health-care provider before practicing twists of any kind.) A variation of the twist Bharadvāṇjāsana (Pose Dedicated to the Sage Bharadvaja) done sitting on a chair is an excellent option because it is so easy to integrate into everyday life.\nEven in such a basic twist, however, there are a few anatomical points to keep in mind. Most important is to elongate the spine; a slumped-over posture significantly limits spinal rotation. So begin by sitting sideways on a stable, armless chair, and take a moment to ground your sitting bones and draw your spine straight up toward the crown of your head. Also, make sure that your spine is perpendicular to the chair seat, neither listing to the side nor to the front or back. The second important point to remember is that each section of the spine has a different rotational mobility. The cervical (neck) vertebrae, for example, are the most mobile in twisting. Because the 12 thoracic (midback) vertebrae have ribs attached, they can’t twist as freely as the neck vertebrae. And because of the orientation of the lumbar (lower spine) facet joints, the rotation of these five vertebrae is the most limited. So to ensure that you don’t over twist in the more mobile parts of your spine, begin your seated twist by bringing your awareness into your lower back and beginning the twist from there. Let the twist gradually unfold up your spine, as though you were walking up a spiral staircase, so that each vertebra participates in the twist. If instead you twist quickly and without awareness, your neck will likely do most of the twisting, and whole sections of your spine can remain “stuck” and unmoving.\nOnce you’ve begun to rotate toward the back of the chair, you can use your hands on the corners of the chair back to deepen the twist in your spine and rib cage. Pull gently with the hand on the near corner and push with the hand on the far corner. Continue to sit tall, and don’t work so hard with the pulling hand that you draw that shoulder forward. As the twist unfolds all the way up into your neck, your head will turn, but be sure to keep your eyes and gaze soft. Hold the twist on each side for a minute or so, and use your breathing to help deepen the twist: On one exhalation, draw yourself taller; on the next exhalation, twist a bit more. With regular practice of this and other simple twists, your spine will regain its full potential for twisting.\nNOW THAT YOU know the basics about restoring your spine’s rotational range of motion, let’s take a look at muscle activity in twists. Many, many muscle groups are involved in twists, contracting and shortening or stretching and lengthening. There are several groups of back muscles of varying length – the rotators, semi-spinalis, and multifidus—that contribute to spinal rotation. Some of the muscles that actively rotate the torso are quite small, like the intercostals, the layers of muscles between each two ribs. And several sets of muscles contribute to your ability to turn your head; the easiest to see is the sternocleidomastoids. The two SCMs sit on the front of your neck, forming a “V” starting at the top of the breastbone and running to the base of the skull just behind teach ear. Look in a mirror: If you turn your head to the right, you’ll see your left SCM contract, and vice versa.\nProbably the most important muscle group in active twisting is the abdominal obliques. The obliques form two layers of muscle on either side of the better-known rectus abdominus, the “six-pack” muscle that runs vertically up the center of the abdomen from the public bone to the rib cage. The two internal obliques, left and right, originate primarily from the pelvis and travel diagonally up across the abdomen, while the two external obliques originate primarily from the lower rib cage and travel diagonally down across the abdomen. All of the obliques have strong attachments to the substantial fascia of the lower back and to the abdomen.\nTake together, the four obliques form a diagonal cross that girdles the abdomen, and they have important functions in supporting the lower back, pelvis, and internal organs. The diagonal lines of the muscles also give them strong leverage in rotating the torso. When you turn to the right in Bharadvajasana, for example, the left external oblique will team with the right internal oblique to rotate your torso. At the same time, the opposite pair of obliques will have to lengthen. And so your twisting range of motion can be reduced by the inability of one pair (one external oblique and the other opposite internal oblique) to lengthen, while weakness in the opposite pair could limit your ability to actively draw yourself into the twist.\nThe obliques have a big part to play in yoga poses, and sometimes that role can be extremely demanding. Twisting arm balances such as Aṣṭāvakrāsana (Eight-angle Pose), and Pārśva Bakāsana (Side Crane Pose) require big work from he obliques. It you’re not quite ready for the difficulties of arm balances, you can still challenge your obliques in standing poses like Trikoṇāsana (Triangle Pose), Ardha Chandrāsana (Half Moon Pose), Pārśvakoṇāsana (Side Angle Pose), and Parivṛtta Trikoṇāsana (Revolved Triangle Pose). Each of these poses requires a strong rotation of the torso against the pull of gravity. For example, when you perform Trikonasana to the right, your muscles actively twist your trunk and neck to the left so that your heart looks straight ahead, not at the floor, and your eyes look up at your left hand. But when you do Parivṛtta Trikoṇāsana to the right, your torso and neck twist strongly to the right, requiring strong contractions of the obliques, the spinal rotators, the intercostals, and the left sternocleidomastoid.\nIn addition to the regular practice of standing poses, you can help keep your obliques strong by practicing the full or modified versions of Jāṭharaparivṛttāsana (Revolved Abdomen Poses). For the modified, milder version, lie on your back, with arms stretched out to the sides at shoulder height and knees pulled up toward your chest. Exhaling, smoothly drop both knees tone side, keeping your knees pulled up toward your arm. On your next exhalation, lift your legs back up toward your chest, flattening your back waist into the floor. For the full pose, lie on your back, arms outstretched again, and stretch your legs straight up toward the ceiling. Lower your straight legs toward the floor on one side (for the maximum challenge, don’t quite touch the floor). Keep stretching out through the soles of the feet; also, when you lift the legs back up to vertical, be sure to press the lower back flat. Since this can be quite a challenging pose, you may want to consult with your health-care provider before trying this if you have lower back or sacroiliac problems.\nNow that you know how to reap the physiological and structural benefits of twists, you might also notice the centering benefits to your consciousness. As the layers of muscle and bone revolve deeply, your attention is drawn into the stable, unmoving center of the pose. And this ability to stay centered as the hubbub of the world swirls around you will pay obvious dividends in the yoga of daily living.\nPublished in Yoga Journal, January/February 2003","What is tai chi?\nTai chi is a system of exercise that has been traditionally practiced in China for hundreds of years. Originally a form of martial arts, in recent decades tai chi has been embraced worldwide as a wellness practice that promotes health and relaxation. Because tai chi is a particularly gentle, meditative form of exercise, it is suitable for people of all ages and fitness levels.\nPracticing tai chi involves carefully going through a series of slow, deliberate motions, while also paying attention to your breath. There are different schools or variants of tai chi, some of which emphasize the martial arts origins of the practice more than others. While doing tai chi, you are meant to stay in slow but constant motion, developing and maintaining a deep awareness of your body. This emphasis on focused awareness makes tai chi a form of meditation as well as exercise.\nTai chi can benefit practitioners in mind, body, and spirit. Some people use tai chi simply as a way to reduce stress and keep fit, while others pursue a deeper spiritual connection through their practice. Tai chi has origins in Taoist, Buddhist and Confucian philosophies such as the yin yang, which teaches that seemingly opposite forces are actually interconnected and united. A tai chi practice can be a method to help people experience that interconnection within themselves. In this way, tai chi is similar to yoga, another movement practice that has the ultimate goal of revealing the unity of mind and body.\nHow does tai chi work?\nAt its basic level, tai chi is a form of exercise that consists of going through different series of motions. You can learn tai chi in a class, from a private teacher, or through instructional videos. Tai chi can be practiced anywhere, and requires no special equipment, making it a versatile, useful option for lowering your stress and improving your fitness.\nPhilosophy and history\nTai chi was originally developed in China, and dates back at least several hundred years. Traditionally, many believe tai chi was created by the Taoist monk Zang Sanfeng in the 12th century. Zang may have developed tai chi to teach his fellow monks both as a means of their spiritual development and self-defense. Some historians, however, believe the practice is more modern and was established in its earliest form by Chen Wangting, a former general who lived in the 17th century, as a variation of another Chinese martial art, kung fu. The Chen school of tai chi that he founded remains popular today.\nTai chi is also descended from the ancient Chinese art of qi gong, a three-thousand-year-old practice that can teach you to control the flow of life force, or qi, through your body. Both tai chi and qi gong involve working with your breath and body, and are meant to help qi flow freely through you. However, qi gong is known for typically using very simple motions. Because tai chi began as a martial art, some of its movements are more complex—similar to forms or katas in other martial arts—and have self-defense applications.\nThe idea of balance and connection between forces is central to tai chi. This is exemplified by the Taoist symbol of the yin-yang, in which white and black halves of a circle make up a unified whole in which each contains a piece of the other. Tai chi practice can be a way of experiencing that balance and connection within yourself.\nAnother key principle of tai chi, which stems from its martial arts origins, is the idea of meeting force with softness, rather than hardening against it. Tai chi teaches that if you harden against force, as people typically do, you will likely get injured. But by softening to the force, you can safely stay with it until it is spent. This idea can be a guide to both tai chi practice itself, and to integrating the lessons of that practice to help you live a life of greater ease and peace.\nTai chi is as a practice predates modern scientific inquiry. While the spiritual and philosophical underpinnings of tai chi may be beyond the purview of science, contemporary researchers have begun to investigate how tai chi can affect the brain and body. This can be difficult because the many different interlocking elements of tai chi—such as movement, breathing, mindfulness, and the relationships between student, class, and teacher—can make isolating which aspect of tai chi does what impossible.\nHowever, studies have found that tai chi may have a beneficial impact on a wide range of health conditions, as well as improve overall wellness, even if they cannot necessarily say why this is the case. Researchers at Harvard Medical School have suggested that because tai chi involves repeatedly going through complex sequences of motions with deliberate, focused attention, it may affect the brain in a manner similar to meditation. Meditation has been shown to result in beneficial changes to the structure of the brain when practiced over time.\nTai chi is often practiced as a series of connected movements, or forms. A tai chi form may involve anywhere from 20 to over 100 movements performed in sequence. The forms are meant to be practiced as slowly as possible. Exercising care and awareness while moving is as important as the actual movement itself, and maintaining mindfulness of breath and body is critical.\nThere are many different schools or versions of tai chi that have evolved over the centuries. The five main schools are Chen, Yang, Wu Hao, Wu and Sun. There are also offshoots or hybrids of the main schools. All schools trace their lineage back to shared historical and philosophical origins, but each school has distinct methods of teaching and practices their own forms.\nWhat are the benefits of tai chi?\nTai chi can help your physical, mental and emotional health. It can also be a spiritual practice and means of developing a deeper sense of mind-body connection. The benefits of tai chi can include improvements to specific conditions or in general aspects of wellness. Many people find the effects of tai chi are cumulative: practicing tai chi regularly over a sustained period of time leads to more substantial, long-term benefits.\nTai chi for seniors and older adults\nTraditional Chinese medicine teaches that tai chi can help slow the aging process. While there is little research on tai chi specifically, this perspective fits with a great deal of contemporary science supporting the anti-aging effects of exercise and the importance of maintaining physical and emotional health at any age. Tai chi is an especially good fit for seniors and older adults, because many of its slow, gentle movements do not require a high level of fitness or mobility to perform, yet can have a significant impact on wellness.\nOther specific benefits of tai chi can include:\nImproving arthritis symptoms\nTai chi has become a popular method of treating arthritis. Many people struggling with arthritis, who are no longer able to engage in more physically demanding forms of exercise, have found tai chi’s gentle movements to be a natural fit. Tai chi can help relieve pain, stress and improve balance in arthritis patients, as well as offer a way to maintain physical fitness.\nIncreasing muscle strength and flexibility\nTai chi can help you to become physically stronger. The slow, deliberate motions work with your muscles on a very deep level, challenging them differently than other strength-building activities. Tai chi can strengthen your upper body as well as your legs and core muscles. Tai chi can also help improve your flexibility and range of motion.\nBecause tai chi helps promote coordination and body awareness, it can help improve your balance. Strength, flexibility and reflexes are key components of balance, and tai chi develops all three. Tai chi exercises also help you to practice testing your balance in a safe way, as your feet move from position to position.\nReducing stress and improving emotional health\nTai chi can be a powerful way of lifting your mood. Exercise in any form can help lower your stress levels and release tension. However, tai chi’s particular emphasis on the mind-body connection means that you can also develop a deeper understanding of yourself, which can lead to feelings of well-being and peace. Tai chi can also reduce physical symptoms of stress: it can lower your heart rate, blood pressure and levels of stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol.\nTai chi is frequently described as meditation in motion. For some people who have tried more traditional, seated meditation practices with little success, tai chi can be a great fit. The physicality of tai chi keeps you from growing too restless, while the emphasis on focus and concentration helps you develop the same ability to observe your mind that is sought in other forms of meditation.\nSafety and side effects\nTai chi is a particularly safe form of exercise. While experts warn that anyone in poor health should consult a physician before trying tai chi, the practice is popular all over the world because it can be done by people of all ages and levels of fitness. Tai chi is very gentle, and a skilled instructor can help guide almost anyone through learning the basic forms.\nFind a Tai Chi Practitioner near you\nThere are hundreds of talented Tai Chi Practitioners on DaoCloud:\nAtlanta, GA · Austin, TX · Baltimore, MD · Boston, MA · Boulder, CO · Buffalo, NY · Charleston, SC · Charlotte, NC · Chicago, IL · Cincinatti, OH · Cleveland, OH · Columbus, OH · Dallas, TX · Denver, CO · Detroit, MI · Houston, TX · Indianapolis, IN · Kansas City, MO · Las Vegas, NV · Los Angeles, CA · Miami, FL · Minneapolis, MN · New York, NY · Orlando, FL · Philadelphia, PA · Phoenix, AZ · Pittsburg, PA · Portland, OR · Raleigh, NC · Salt Lake City, UT · San Antonio, TX · San Diego, CA · San Francisco, CA · San Jose, CA · Seattle, WA · St. Louis, MO · Tampa, FL · Tucson, AZ · Washington, DC\nEasing Ills through Tai Chi\nNell Porter Brown\nHarvard Magazine, 2016\nThe Health Benefits of Tai Chi\nHarvard Women's Health Watch, 2015"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"novice_inquirer"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8f9d74c0-b76e-41d6-bfd6-a1776ffaf45b>","<urn:uuid:368b78b9-59f5-452b-b44e-e38b127d701b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What role do weather conditions play in both sailing navigation and avalanche risk assessment in the Arctic regions, and how do these factors influence trip planning?","answer":"Weather conditions significantly impact both sailing and avalanche safety in Arctic regions. For sailing, the weather determines how far the boat can navigate each day and which fjords can be accessed - for instance, the weather forecast influences whether boats can venture beyond Isfjord to explore the northwest coast of Spitsbergen. Regarding avalanche risk, weather factors like snowfall intensity, wind speeds, and temperature directly affect safety conditions. Heavy snowfall combined with strong winds (which can gust up to 70 mph) can create very dangerous avalanche conditions requiring careful planning. Multiple weak layers in the snowpack can produce large avalanches with added snow load. Trip planners must remain flexible, potentially modifying routes based on conditions, and may need to avoid certain terrain entirely during high-risk periods.","context":["mai 24 - 29. mai 2022\nWelcome to one of our most exclusive trips so far. When the skiing season is about to end in mainland Norway, it’s at it’s best in the arctic archipelago of Svalbard! The sun is back and shining 24 hours a day, animals are back and thriving and the snow-conditions are perfect, so May’s a fantastic time in Svalbard.\nSvalbard can offer fjords, mountains and vast wilderness areas that are still untouched by human activity even now in our time. The traces we find in the nature here are not from people, but from the polar fox, seals, birds, reindeer or the queen of these lands, the polar bear! On this trip we’ll be accompanied by the wild animals and the elements; air, ocean and ice in every way - from sea ice, to glaciers and snow we can ski in all forms.\nWith 6 days at hand we have time to get to know the Isfjord. And if the weather forecast allows us we have the alternative of navigating out of the Isfjord basin and up along the north-west coast of the island Spitsbergen to the really majestic fjords. How far we sail each day to ski will of course be due to weather and snow-conditions along the way.\nWe will experience and explore raw nature, ski-tour and get tired and pumped, and eat and drink well. We use the dinghy to shore, put on our skis and skins at the beach, hike up and ski down a mountainside probably nobody have skied before us. Everything is set for an awesome trip!\nThe ski touring we do during this week will be planned with everyone the day before. After a day’s hike and ski we relax in the boat with warm and good food, before we sail to the next fjord, harbour or anchorage.\nWith us onboard on this trip we bring a certified ski-guide with several years of experience with this type of ski-touring in Svalbard.\nThis trip starts and ends in Longyearbyen, the main city of Svalbard. See the day-to-day program for more information.\nOn our trips we travel as sustainable as possible, we will use our sails as much as possible without using engine, and we try to not leave any lasting traces at sea or land. In SailNorway we are engaged in taking care of the environment as much as we can and we think that smaller sailing boats with fewer people and little pollution and waste, are way less harmful to the environment, the climate and local wildlife, compared to bigger vessels and cruise ships. We do also try to clean up plastic in the places we visit instead of leaving any trash. At Svalbard we follow AECOs regulations for encountering with wildlife, beach cleaning, cultural heritage sites and for visitors and tourist operators in the Arctic. You can read more about AECO’s guidelines here.\nEpic. Epic. Epic. As a skier and a outdoors-man it is impossible not to dream of Svalbard. There is also a very special light and skiing opportunities long into the summer.\nDay 1: Ship o’hoi - let’s meet and set sails!\nWelcome on board! We will meet in Longyearbyen harbour at 10:00, get settled in to the boat and get to know each other. Before we set sails, we’ll take you through safety routines on board, and familiarize you with the boat. We eat dinner on our way out of the fjord and we will try to get a ski hike during the day.\nDay 2: Skitouring in outer Isfjorden\nThe most famous and visited fjord in Svalbard is Isfjorden. In their respective side fjords in this fjord system, lies the cities of Longyearbyen, Barentsburg and Pyramiden as well as smaller abandoned places. The fjord is surrounded by great mountains for skiing, so before we sail north, we go for a hike or two around Isfjorden.\nDay 3 - 4: Isfjorden, Kongsfjorden (Kings Bay), Krossfjorden\nThese days we use in the Isfjord, and if the weather forecast allows us we will explore the magnificent fjords on the north-west coast of the Spitsbergen island. With ski touring and sailing, nice meals and spectacular wilderness!\nDay 5: Sailing back home towards Longyearbyen\nWe start thinking about the return, whether it'll be from the Isfjord or the southwards travel back home and stop for a skitour along the way if we see that there's time for it. We aim for a visit in Barentsburg and finish the day with dinner in Longyearbyen this last night!\nDay 6: Thanks for a great trip!\nAfter breakfast we clean ourselves out of the boat and we wish each other a good travel back home. Thanks for a great trip in these beautiful surroundings! If you have the time, we recommend spending an extra day or two in Longyearbyen to relax after the week’s impressions and get to know more of this little multicultural Arctic hub.\nThe program may change according to weather and conditions, but it gives an indication of how we spend the days. We start every day with a good breakfast and make a packed lunch before we go ashore. Some of the days we eat dinner right away after skiing, other days we just eat a little when we come back to the boat, and then sail on before we make a later dinner. Some days, we spend time fishing, and time to look around. If the weather should be really not in favour of skiing, then we spend the day sailing or do something else fun.\nTravel - in general\nSometimes we have to fly, but not always. If you have the luxury of time, we always encourage to travel as environmentally friendly as possible. Traveling slowly also gives another start to a holiday. Cycling, taking the train or driving a car together are good alternatives! Feel free to add some extra time before and after, since up in the north weather that can sometimes change your plans.\nVery few row to Svalbard, a few more sail, but most fly. Norwegian and SAS fly to Longyearbyen, check out www.norwegian.no or www.sas.no.\nWhat exactly is Ski & Sail?\nSki & Sail is a trip concept where we sail into the foothills of the mountains and start the ski trip by the edge of the water. By boat we can move from place to place, and choose mountain sides and areas based on weather and conditions. Ski & Sail is something Italian and French skiers have done in Norway since the 90s, and something Norwegians so far have only started to discovered the joys of. SailNorway has arranged Ski & Sail trips on Helgeland, in Steigen, in the Lofoten Islands, in Lyngen, Finnmark and on Svalbard for many years, and we dare say that we know many of the very best places along the coast. Skiing & Sailing is really cool!\nLevel of this trip - medium level\nOn this trip we require some experience with randonee/alpine touring/backcountry skiing. If you have a lot of experience it is great, and you will get to work on your skills and techniques. Those with a lot of experience often ski steeper slopes than the others, and may take on several runs during one day. But we try to keep the level as even as possible, so we can choose the destination from the participants' level. If you are in doubt as to whether this is the trip for you, please feel free to contact us, and we can look at the level of the other participants and find a trip that suits you perfectly - whether you are a beginner or experienced.\nSafety and risk - in general\nSailing wise, our trips are not difficult, and you are always welcome to join us! We have with us both people who have never sailed before and experienced sailors. However, you must be prepared for everything from no wind to sailing in harsh weather. If you are a beginner, we will try to make you a seaman/woman as soon as possible. If you are experienced you will be given responsibility and greater challenges. We take safety seriously and on our trips we train on handling different situations that can occur at sea. Man-over-board, fire, abandon vessel, dismasting and grounding are some of these. Building the participants' skills on how to handle critical situations are important elements for better safety on board. On board a boat and on trips, everyone must know what to do in potentially dangerous situations. For us it is important that you as a guest and participant is trained quickly enough to be a participant not a passenger. It contributes to learning, sense of achievement and increased safety for all. It's also why our trips are considered to be sailing courses, you are trained to be one of the crewmembers on board.\nWe have the same mindset when it comes to skiing and alpine/backcountry trips. The first day of skiing we train and repeat search and rescue techniques, and the use of avalanche equipment. Many elements determine the safety of an alpine/backcountry trip. Good planning, humbleness in relation to weather and avalanche risk, and a dynamic group are important.\nMountain hikes and alpine/backcountry trips involves a certain risk, as does sailing. However, we as an operator, and our skippers and ski guides, do everything we can to minimize the risk in a professional manner. Everyone gains on this and we have no one to lose. Feel free to contact us to discuss risk.\nIf we are in a place without snow, we sail to where the snow is! With the sailboat we are flexible with regards to finding the best snow, but that means we may go somewhere that is not mentioned in the program or a place that we have not tested in advance. Then it's extra exciting.\nOrdinary alpine/backcountry equipment is required for this trip, that means avalanche-/ski backpack with beacon, probe and shovel, and alpine/backcountry skis with skins and ski crampons. We have a few backpacks/sets that can be hired through us and ski equipment can be rented through our partners. In good time before departure we will send you a detailed recommended packing list for this trip.\nFood and cooking\nOn our trips everyone contributes to the operation of the boat, so as long as you have not booked one of our trips with a designated chef, all take their turns in the galley during the trip. Skippers and guides assist as much as they can along the way. In advance of the trip, we set up a menu and shop what is needed. We offer good menus with healthy and medium-advanced food. If you have allergies or preferences let us know in the registration form, and we take that into account.\nWhat we expect from you\nWe want you to take part in the routines onboard the sailboat, whether it is sailing, docking, navigating, looking for whales and icebergs, washing up, cooking, clean the boat or contribute in other ways when required. Our trips require a little work of the participants - and you must be open to contribute and open up a bit socially. We have many different people with us on our trips, and most people go very well together. Our experience is that doing things with others out in nature, and not least do things with new people with different personalities than one might be used to, is what creates the best, most interesting and memorable stories :)\nLife on board and accommodation\nLife on board a sailboat is social and pleasant, but for some it can be perceived as quite intimate and crowded, which is important to be prepared for. On our trips everyone participates in the operation of the sailboat and everyone is considered crew. We would like to get to know you well and hope that you will get to know everyone else on the sailboat as soon as possible. It requires some patience, generosity and an open mind to thrive, but the new acquaintances and completely raw nature experiences are quickly what will take your focus as soon as you become comfortable with life at sea.\nAccommodation on the boat is part of the fun. The accommodation is generally in shared cabins, some of which have a double bed and some have a bunk bed solution. The distribution is quite a puzzle, but we do believe we are quite good at it. Let us know if you have any special needs or reservations.Any accommodation before and after the trip must be arranged on its own. If you have any doubts about where to stay, we’re happy to give you some recommendations.\nOn the boat we have a lot of heat and a lot of good food, but not always abundance of fresh water.\nWhat kind of people join this trip?\nMany come alone, some travel as couples, some travel as a group of friends. The common denominator for everyone is that these are fun and committed people you become friends with almost no matter what. Sharing grand experiences creates strong ties! Many people wonder about the age composition of our trips, but that is not so important to us. It doesn't matter if you are young or old as long as you want to go on a trip and intend to do your part so that you and the rest of the crew will have a good trip together.\nEnvironment and sustainability\nBoth sailing and alpine/backcountry trips are environmentally friendly activities and we sail as much as we can and use the engine as little as possible. We encourage crew and participants to travel as environmentally-friendly as possible, and we use local ingredients and resources as far as possible. We also have our own trips where we collect litter and clean ocean trash from beaches.\nPhilosophically we often say that sailing is an exercise in sustainability; we move with the wind and we have limitations on things like water, diesel, electricity and food. In order to run sustainable - knowledge, patience, agility and hard work are required. The same can be said about many other things that one tries to do in a sustainable way.\nChanges to the program\nThe program should be seen as a starting point that we adapt to weather and conditions. We also reserve the right to constantly improve our itineraries. Onboard with us we always have a dinghy for beach landings and small expeditions, we have fishing gear for the cod, and gear to hike or make a bonfires on the beach - we are ready for adventure!

As of early Thursday morning we have already received 6 to 12″ of new snow (0.5 to 1.0″ of SWE) and winds have picked up to the mid-thirties on Sunburst with gusts up to 70 mph. Snowfall intensity and wind speeds are forecast to peak around noon today, with an additional 12″ of snow accumulation and sustained strong winds. Natural avalanches 2-5′ deep are likely and human triggered avalanches are very likely. Due to the amount of new snow avalanches can be triggered in sheltered areas in addition to wind loaded areas. It is pretty simple today, avalanche conditions are very dangerous so avoid avalanche terrain and be aware of overhead hazards because natural avalanches are likely and could runout to valley bottoms.\nThe snow line should be between 400-800′ today with wet snow falling up to 1200′. The southern flow direction of this storm system is likely to drop more snow in Girdwood, Portage, and Placer than Turnagain Pass. Several weak layers exist in the upper snowpack which could produce large avalanches with the added new snow load. These include a layer of low density new snow that fell early in the storm on Sunday (see video here) and a layer of buried facets on top of the New Years crust. Both these layers have shown signs of instability in recent tests (see ob here). Regardless of the exact weak layer, the snowpack is likely to be overloaded today with the rapid addition of new snow and strong winds.\nExample of existing weak layers in the upper snowpack. In this location there is potential for failure on either a weak layer within the storm snow from Sunday/Monday or on a deeper layer of buried facets above the New Years crust. Photo 1.12.22\nYesterday: Light to moderate snow showers and clouds in and out throughout the day. Snow accumulations of 6-12″ (0.5 – 1.0″ SWE) as of this morning. Winds were moderate in the mid teens to twenties with gusts into the mid thirties. Temperatures hovered just below freezing at 1800′ and in the twenties at ridgetops.\nToday: Today should be a full on storm day, with heavy snowfall and strong winds peaking during daylight hours. Accumulations of around a foot of snow today with potential for higher amounts in Girdwood, Portage, and Placer. Winds will be out of the east in the 40 mph range with gusts ranging from 60-90 mph. Snow level should be 400-800 ft with wet snow up to 1200 ft.\nTomorrow: The storm will shift to a more southerly flow on Friday, which means some areas will see continued and potentially increased snowfall intensity and other areas will see minimal additional accumulation. Currently, weather models are showing minimal additional snowfall in Turnagain Pass on Friday. However, in Girdwood, Portage, and Placer snowfall looks to continue throughout the day on Friday. The snow line elevation could rise a bit during the day as temperatures increase slightly.

{"question":"What are the key benefits organizations can get from improving their web accessibility?","answer":"Organizations can reduce legal action risk, demonstrate social responsibility, improve search engine optimization, increase website usability leading to better donor conversions, realize potential market share increases, and better serve their constituents.","context":["What is web accessibility and why should we be talking about it? Simply put, it means that people of all abilities (including those with disabilities) can use your website. Web accessibility ensures that all users, no matter who they are or what devices they use, have a great user experience on the web.\nThink of web accessibility as the digital equivalent to real-world accessibility solutions such as ramps, greater transportation options, Braille in elevators, sign language interpreters, and so on. For digital devices, these solutions include screen readers, voice recognition software, screen magnifiers, and alternative input devices. More than 285 million people worldwide are estimated to be visually impaired and 360 million people worldwide have disabling hearing loss – these are your donors, volunteers, and users of your services. And no constituent deserves to be ignored when it comes to your website.\nThere are internationally recognized guidelines in effect to help anyone with a website ensure it meets at least one of three levels of accessibility criteria. The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0 (WCAG), which have been in effect since 2008, covers a broad range of recommendations to improve accessibility of web content to a wider range of people with disabilities, from blindness and deafness to learning disabilities, cognitive limitations, and limited movement or speech disabilities, or combinations thereof. You may have already heard of many of them such as providing video captioning or transcripts, text alternatives, or audio recordings.\nNonprofits have a unique responsibility, and face unique risk, when it comes to web accessibility.\nMany nonprofits have a mission to serve diverse audiences, and this includes providing easy access to educational materials and other services for those audiences. While that includes both children and adults with disabilities, it can also include seniors with age-related impairments.\nMissions and social responsibility aside, there could be legal ramifications for organizations that don’t improve their web accessibility. While organizations’ legal responsibility is still unclear, the number of lawsuits related to accessibility claims against various business websites, including ToysRUs, Bank of America, and Netflix, among others, have been on the rise.\nGet ready for some scary source material: The Americans with Disabilities Act, Title III, Public Accommodations and Commercial Facilities, implies web accessibility requirements, while the U.S. Department of Justice holds that there is a “pre-existing” obligation to make websites accessible, even though the DOJ won’t have any clear rules for at least another two years or so. The Section 508 of the U.S. Rehabilitation Act requires electronic and information technology be available to people with disabilities, including federal employees and members of the public. Section 504 applies to federal programs or organizations that receive federal funds to ensure people with disabilities receive equal access to those programs and services.\nWhew, now that we are past that, let’s ask a simpler question. What does this mean for nonprofits?\nWeb accessibility is not going away; in fact, it’s becoming increasingly necessary, and in certain cases, required. Your organization should be thinking about this issue right now. By evaluating and improving your web accessibility, you can become an industry leader in this area—which comes with several benefits:\n- You can reduce your risk of legal action.\n- You can demonstrate corporate/organizational social responsibility, which is great PR, by the way.\n- You can improve your search engine optimization.\n- You can provide increased website usability, which leads to increased donor conversions.\n- You can realize a potential increase in market share.\n- Most important, you can better serve your constituents.\nNext post, we’ll discuss the main principles of web accessibility and putting those principles into practice."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:392d2e89-1046-4786-8189-1b3819c4a8a9>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What was William Sherwin's groundbreaking innovation in textile printing in 1676?","answer":"In 1676, William Sherwin patented a new method of printing on broad calico and Scottish cloth using a double-necked rolling press, which he claimed was the only true way of East India printing and staining such goods.","context":["In my previous post on this subject I talked about Hooke’s dealings with some of London’s artists. This time I’m going to talk about craftsmen (broadly defined). To set the scene I’d like to share a conversation Hooke had at Garraway’s coffehouse on Boxing Day December 1673 with Andrew Yarranton and ‘Captain Hamden’. These two gentlemen had been to Germany to see some ‘Lattin making works’ – ie. factories producing tin plate – and they described to Hooke what they had seen. This is how Hooke recorded it:\n‘many plates beat under ye Hammer at once like leaf gold or tinfoyle. the great difficulty is how to turne it under ye hammer quick enough. much discourse about ye great cast iron rowles softned turned & graven for stuffs. one of six foot long & six foot about. cast iron pillars for bridges. hardning iron into steel quite through. pressing of cloth &c’\nI love this conversation because you can smell the Industrial Revolution in the air – but I’m quoting it here because of the reference to cast iron rollers engraved for printing patterns on cloth (‘stuffs’). The first English patent for printing on cloth was taken out a few years later, in 1676, by the artist William Sherwin.\nSherwin is an interesting figure with whom Hooke kept in intermittent contact. He was a leading engraver – this is his portrait of Charles II produced in 1669, the first datable English mezzotint. Although Sherwin states here that Prince Rupert helped him with the new process historians believe he discovered it independently. In 1676 Sherwin patented a new method of ‘printing of broad calico and Scotish cloath with a double necked rowling press . . . the only true way of East India printing & stayning such kind of goods’. Hooke recorded in August 1676 ‘saw Sherwins new invented way of staining calico’.\nPrinting cloth was new in England, but Sherwin was not the only person working on the process and Hooke had discussed methods of staining calico with Theodore Haak FRS earlier in the year. Interestingly, Hooke also made some trials himself. In 1672 he recorded ‘Mr Barret shewd me his flowered printed cloth’. Unfortunately I’ve not been able to identify Barret but he was clearly a craftsman of some kind, possibly a metal-worker, and Hooke had regular contact with him. In August 1673 he ‘Saw new stuff at Barrets and new printers Black’, and shortly afterwards ‘harry at Barrets carryd pattern to be cast.’ This raises the tantalising possibility that Hooke had designed a fabric print (but of course it may have been something else). In March 1674 he wrote ‘at Barrets made tryall of Golding flowerd Shift wch succeeded.’ – which (I think!) means that they tried applying gold leaf to a shift already printed with a flower pattern. As late as 1679 Hooke was still discussing cloth printing with Barrett: ‘At Barrets, with him to Garways [ie. Garraway’s coffeehouse]. Discoursd to him the way of staining Sattin with Lead moulds and copper plates.’\nThis is just one of the points at which the world of Restoration art overlaps with the world of craft, or manufacturing. If anything, Hooke and his Royal Society colleagues were more interested in the latter. Hooke records very many conversations in coffeehouses and elsewhere with people who are keepers of trade secrets or innovators in fields related to manufacturing. In my previous post I mentioned the Royal Society’s interest in dyeing and colours, which Hooke shared; Hooke also discussed methods of transferring painted or printed images; staining marble; glass-painting; making marbled paper; enamelling of tiles; recipes for varnish; and even ‘a paint not to be washed from the face with wett’ (a longstanding desideratum of the cosmetics industry!).\nI will single out just one more of these connections for further discussion. Hooke several times mentions John Dwight, a well-known potter who took out a patent in 1672 for ‘making transparent earthenware, commonly known by the names of porcelane or China and Persian ware, and also the mistery of making the stone ware vulgarly called Collogne ware’. Dwight opened a pottery at Fulham, and attempted to make all the types of ceramics imported into England at the time. Like many others he was particularly keen to make porcelain, and excavations at his pottery show that he conducted experimental trials with clays and glazes. Dwight studied at Oxford where he apparently met Hooke and Robert Boyle, and he later said that these two men supported his endeavours. In 1673 he confided to Hooke his secret for making salt-glazed stoneware: ‘he told me he used salt to throw into his fire as the Dutch’; and in 1674 Hooke saw some of the results and was impressed: ‘Saw Mr Dwights english china. Dr Willis his head. a little boye wth a hauke on his fist. severall little jarrs of severall colours all exceeding hard as a flint very light of very good shape. the performance very admirable and outdoing any European potters.’\nDwight was unusual in that his figures were modelled rather than cast from moulds. Early in 1675 Hooke showed one at a meeting of the Royal Society: ‘Mr Hooke brought in an artifical head resembling china, made in England, of English clay, so hard and solid, that he said, that nothing would fasten on it, except a diamond; and that it received its polish in the fire’. This durability was possibily of interest to Hooke because of his various architectural commissions. Dwight was able to make life-sized portrait busts, and Hooke seems to have thought of him in connection with a bust of Dr Baldwin Hamey the younger for the Royal College of Physicians, whose Anatomy Theatre Hooke designed.\nHooke’s association with Dwight shows how connections between the scientific and arts/crafts communities in Restoration London could be mutually beneficial. Dwight’s methodical experiments with chemicals and materials at his pottery may have been influenced by his knowledge of Boyle and Hooke’s experimental methods in Oxford, and his success brought him to the attention of the Royal Society (full of wealthy gentlemen who were potential patrons). Hooke and the other Fellows were interested in Dwight’s work for its scientific value in investigating different types of clays and glazes. This is just one example of this kind of relationship, but I’m hoping to find others as I continue working on Hooke’s diary.\nAuthor’s note: These two posts on Hooke’s relationships with artists and craftsmen were taken from a conference paper I delivered at ICHSTM Manchester (July 2013) in a session organised by Dr Sachiko Kusukawa as part of her research network ‘The Origins of Science as a Visual Pursuit‘. I would like to thank Sachiko for inviting me to take part. I would also like to thank (and congratulate) the Trustees of the British Museum for allowing members of the public to use the Museum’s images on non-profit websites without special permission."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:7e69e5e5-39c0-4a78-b904-772eaab74c9d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does preparing for Holy Communion compare with managing daily stress - what steps are recommended for each?","answer":"For Holy Communion, preparation requires being Catholic, making confession if carrying serious sin, reconciling with neighbors, fasting for at least one hour before Mass, and wearing one's finest clothing for this special encounter. For managing daily stress, recommended steps include practicing deep breathing techniques to reduce physical symptoms like increased heart rate and blood pressure, establishing regular sleep schedules, engaging in physical activity (which can show benefits after just 5 minutes), and identifying stress triggers. Both situations require conscious preparation and specific actions to achieve the desired outcome.","context":["3.46 Čemu toliko naglašavati grijeh umjesto nadu?\nNeki misle da Crkva daje preveliki naglasak na ono što svi rade pogrešno, a ne na ono što ljudi rade ispravno.

In the Eucharist, the sanctifying action of God in our regard and our worship of him reach their high point. It contains the whole spiritual good of the Church, Christ himself, our Pasch. Communion with divine life and the unity of the People of God are both expressed and effected by the Eucharist. Through the Eucharistic celebration we are united already with the liturgy of heaven and we have a foretaste of eternal life. [CCCC 274]\nWhat is Holy Eucharist?\nHoly Eucharist is the sacrament in which Jesus Christ gives his Body and Blood—himself—for us, so that we too might give ourselves to him in love and be united with him in Holy Communion. In this way we are joined with the one Body of Christ, the Church.\nAfter Baptism and Confirmation, the Eucharist is the third sacrament of initiation of the Catholic Church. The Eucharist is the mysterious center of all these sacraments, because the historic sacrifice of Jesus on the Cross is made present during the words of consecration in a hidden, unbloody manner. Thus the celebration of the Eucharist is “the source and summit of the Christian life” (Second Vatican Council, Lumen gentium [LG], 11). Everything aims at this; besides this there is nothing greater that one could attain. When we eat the broken Bread, we unite ourselves with the love of Jesus, who gave his body for us on the wood of the Cross; when we drink from the chalice, we unite ourselves with him who even poured out his blood out of love for us. We did not invent this ritual. Jesus himself celebrated the Last Supper with his disciples and therein anticipated his death; he gave himself to his disciples under the signs of bread and wine and commanded them from then on, even after his death, to celebrate the Eucharist. “Do this in remembrance of me” (1 Cor 11:24). [Youcat 208]\nWhat sort of preparation do I need in order to be able to receive Holy Eucharist?\nSomeone who would like to receive Holy Eucharist must be Catholic. If he has a serious sin on his conscience, he must first make a confession. Before approaching the altar, one should be reconciled with his neighbors.\nUntil a few years ago, the practice was to eat nothing for at least three hours before Mass; that was how people prepared to encounter Christ in Holy Communion. Today the Church requires at least one hour of fasting. Another sign of reverence is to wear one’s finest clothing—after all, we have a rendezvous with the Lord of the world. [Youcat 220]\nThis is what the Popes say\nIn hope we were saved, says Saint Paul to the Romans, and likewise to us (Rom 8:24). According to the Christian faith, “redemption”—salvation—is not simply a given. Redemption is offered to us in the sense that we have been given hope, trustworthy hope, by virtue of which we can face our present: the present, even if it is arduous, can be lived and accepted if it leads towards a goal, if we can be sure of this goal, and if this goal is great enough to justify the effort of the journey. [Pope Benedict XVI, Se Salvi, n. 1]","How Does Stress Affect The Body: Symptoms And Solutions\nUpdated August 27, 2020\nMedically Reviewed By: Lori Jones, LMHC\nAre you exhausted all the time? Do you have a lot of muscle tension and pain? Is your head or stomach bothering you? It could be stress. There is a long list of symptoms that falls under the question, “How does stress affect the body?” And, learning how to identify the symptoms can help you find the right solution.\nStress levels have been on the rise in Americans over recent years. It’s impacting people of all ages and spans a wide range of worries and concerns.\nThe Impact Of Chronic Stress\nEveryday stress can have a negative impact on multiple areas of your life. However, when the stressful situation passes, you may find that things return to normal even if you didn’t do anything to address your stress. This isn’t the healthiest way to get through stress, but it happens this way for some people.\nHowever, if you’re experiencing chronic stress, it’s not going to just go away. It may not be tied to a specific situation in your life. Instead, it might be the result of poor habits or not knowing how to deal with past trauma. It will not just go away if left untreated.\nThe Effect Of Stress On The Body\nStress can wreak havoc on your body if it’s left unchecked. Not only does occasional stress show up in your body, but chronic stress can also have long-term negative consequences for your physical health. When you are feeling stressed, you may experience:\n- Increased heart rate\n- Rising blood pressure\n- Muscle tension\n- Upset stomach\n- Lack of sexual desire\n- Change in appetite\nAnd these are just a few of the symptoms that you may experience. If you suffer from chronic stress, the symptoms above can start to turn into more serious health consequences.\nChronic stress can lead to health problems such as heart disease, high blood pressure, gastrointestinal problems, heart attack, and strokes, among others. These are clear indicators that allowing chronic stress to continue in your life can be detrimental to your physical health and well-being.\nHow Stress Affects Mental Health\nStress also impacts your mental health and wellness. It can lead to you experiencing many different negatives and difficult emotions such as sadness, anger, frustration, and fear.\nSome of the mental health symptoms that you may notice in your life from stress include:\n- Lack of motivation\n- Irritability and anger\n- Lack of concentration and focus\nThese are serious symptoms that should not be taken lightly. If you experience chronic stress, you may begin to think that these symptoms are just a normal part of life. But, they’re not. All of these symptoms can grow into more serious problems if you don’t work on addressing them.\nHow Stress Affects Behavior\nStress can also impact your behavior. If you look at the symptoms listed above under physical and mental health, it can be easier to understand how stress changes your behavior. If you’re living under constant overwhelm and anxiety and experiencing things like frequent headaches or stomach aches, it can be easy to lose your temper with your loved ones, for example. Here are some of the other behavioral changes that you may experience in your life as a result of stress:\n- Angry outbursts\n- Eating too much or not enough\n- Substance use or abuse\n- Social withdrawal\nThese behaviors can have a negative spiral effect on your life. For example, as your withdrawal from friends and family because of stress, you may find that you struggle even more to cope with stress in your life. This can lead to additional problems which keep you away from a social activity even more. This is why it’s important to learn to recognize and healthily address your stress.\nStress Management Tips To Overcome Chronic Stress\nThankfully there are many things that you can do to address your chronic stress and learn to overcome it. This doesn’t mean that you’ll never experience stress again. Instead, it means that when you do go through stressful situations, you’ll have tips and strategies that you can use to relieve stress and handle it healthily.\nSome of the stress management solutions you may benefit from include:\nLearn to identify your stress triggers\nWhen you start to feel stressed, it can be helpful to take time to identify where the feelings are coming from. This allows you to begin investigating what you can do to make to address it.\nWhile there will be some things causing you to stress that you can’t do anything about, there will be some things that you can address. For example, if a family member’s behavior is causing you to feel stressed, you probably aren’t going to be able to control how they are behaving. But you may be able to establish boundaries in your life that stop the other person’s behavior from having as large of a negative consequence on you.\nThere will be some things that you find are short term stressors. But there also might be habits that you identify that are causing you unnecessary stress. When you learn where the stress is coming from, you can start to take your first steps to address or removing it.\nPractice Deep Breathing\nWhen you’re starting to feel the stress and tension build up within your body, deep breathing can help to break up some of the physical symptoms that you’re experiencing. For example, you may notice that you start to breathe faster as your frustration grows. This can cause your heart to race, as well. And, as your heart beats faster, your blood pressure rises. These physical symptoms can continue to build and even lead to things like full-blown panic attacks.\nDeep breathing can help to stop your physical symptoms from progressing. As you start taking slow, deep breaths in and out, you may notice that it feels like your blood pressure is lowering, and your heart rate is returning to normal.\nYou may also find that deep breathing can help you to slow your thoughts. Your mind will be forced to temporarily shift from your stress and worry to the breathing technique that you’re using. This can help you to regain mental clarity and look for solutions to the stressful situation or problem that you’re facing.\nThere are multiple types of breathing techniques that you can use, so practice a few of them to find what works best for you. It can also help to practice them when you’re not under stress, so when you find your stress starting to build, you will know how to put the breathing exercise to use without too much thought.\nNot getting enough sleep can make it even harder to deal with stress. You may find that you struggle to be patient with others, and you cannot think clearly to look for solutions. If you’re having problems falling asleep or staying asleep due to stress, it’s an important symptom to address.\nMany different things may help improve sleep troubles. A few that you could try include:\n- Keeping a strict sleep schedule\n- Cutting out caffeine\n- Not exercising too close to bedtime.\n- Sleeping in a dark, cool room\n- Using white noise\nHowever, if you’re continuing to struggle, don’t be afraid to talk with your doctor to explore additional options.\nGet More Physical Activity\nPhysical activity and exercise can help you release tension that has built up from chronic stress. It also releases chemicals in your brain that work to boost your mood. But these chemicals also act as natural pain killers, which can help reduce some of the physical symptoms you’re experiencing.\nThere are other ways that physical activity and exercise can help with stress. You may find that you sleep better when you exercise. And, you may experience a boost in your self-esteem as well.\nThe Anxiety and Depression Association of America shares that you may start to experience these positive mental boosts after just five minutes of physical activity. So, if you’re feeling stressed, you don’t need to feel like you have to get in a full workout. Simply getting moving for a few minutes can start to help.\nTalk To Someone\nHaving a trusted person to turn to for support can help when you’re going through stressful situations or experiencing chronic stress. This could be a friend or family member. It could also be a support group. For example, if you’re under stress as a result of losing a loved one, you may benefit from connecting in a group for others experiencing grief from losing someone.\nIf you don’t have anyone to turn to or could use additional support in handling your stress, a licensed therapist is an effective option to consider. Not only can they listen as you talk through the stress in your life, but they also have education on how to help you overcome it. A therapist, like those at BetterHelp, can assist you in finding stress-relieving strategies that work for your specific situation.\nPrevious ArticleHow Stress Can Lead To Emotional Breakdowns And What You Can Do To Avoid It\nNext ArticleAre You Under Too Much Stress?

{"question":"What are the key similarities and differences between storing the sacred anointing oil in ancient times versus preserving bacon salt today in terms of preservation methods and storage duration?","answer":"The sacred anointing oil had to be stored as a holy substance that was forbidden for unauthorized personal use and could not be duplicated, while bacon salt can be freely stored in household refrigerators or freezers. For preservation, the anointing oil was kept in the Communion Tent as a sacred substance meant to last for generations, while bacon salt requires refrigeration and lasts only 4 weeks in the refrigerator or up to 6 months when frozen in a tightly sealed container to prevent ice crystal formation.","context":["The Incense Altar\n||Make an altar to burn incense out of acacia wood.\n||It shall be square, a cubit long and a cubit wide, and 2 cubits high, including its horns.\n||Cover it with a layer of pure gold, on its top, its walls all around, and its horns.

Some say that it was 15' x 15' x 30' (Eruvin 4a; Maaseh Choshev 7:1). It appears that it was made of solid wood (cf. Exodus 27:8), although some say that it was like an inverted box (Maaseh Choshev 7:1).\nOr 'protrusions' (see Exodus 27:2). Some say that these protrusions were small cubes, three fingerbreadths (2 1/4') on each side (Maaseh Choshev 7:1). Others, however, maintain that they were horn-like protrusions. See note on Exodus 27:2.\nThe Talmud notes that this layer was as thick as a dinar (Eruvin 19a). See note on Exodus 38:24.\n|two gold rings...|\nSome say that they were on opposite corners of the altar (Maaseh Choshev 7:1). Others say that it had four rings, one on each corner (Abarbanel; cf. Baaley Tosafoth).\n|in front of the cloth partition|\nBetween the table and the lamp (see Exodus 26:34; Yoma 33b; Yad, Beth HaBechirah 3:17).\nEduth in Hebrew. Or, 'communion place.'\nDonated by an individual and not made special for this purpose (Rashi). Or, made with unauthorized ingredients (Ibn Ezra; Ramban).\nLiterally, 'burnt offering.'\n|once each year|\nOn Yom Kippur (Rashi; Yoma 61a). See Leviticus 16:18. See Leviticus 4:7.\nBy placing blood (Rashi).\nSome say that this was after the sin of the Golden Calf (Yerushalmi, Shekalim 2:3).\n|take a census|\n(Targum; Saadia). Literally, 'when you lift the head.' See Genesis 40:13,20.\n|to determine their numbers|\nOr, 'to count each one separately' (Saadia). Pakad in Hebrew. See Genesis 21:1.\nLiterally, 'sanctuary shekel' or 'holy shekel.'\n|a shekel is 20 gerahs|\nA gerah is the same as a ma'ah (Targum), a weight equivalent to 1.14 grams. Hence, a shekel is 22.8 grams or 0.8 ounces. Josephus notes that it is around 4 drachmas (Antiquities 3:8:2). A half shekel was a silver coin around the size of a half dollar.\nKiyyor in Hebrew. It looked like a large kettle with two spigots for washing (Rashi; Maaseh Choshev 6:8; Yoma 37a). According to others, it was apparently like a basin with spigots (Radak, Sherashim, who says it was like a cuenca, Spanish for basin). It was later made with 12 spigots (Yoma 37a). See 1 Samuel 2:14.\n(Targum; Rashi; Ibn Janach; Radak, Sherashim). Kan in Hebrew. See 1 Kings 7:38, 2 Chronicles 4:14 (cf. Ibn Ezra). In shape, the base was somewhat like an inverted pot (Tosafoth, Zevachim 22a, s.v. Kal VeChomer; Maaseh Choshev 6:9), or like an open box (Tosafoth). Some say that it was 3 handbreadths (9') high (Rabbenu Meyuchas).\nLater, this base was made to include a mechanism to fill the washstand with water (Yad, Beth HaBechirah 3:18), as well as machinery to lower the entire washstand into a well (Raavad ibid.; Yoma 37a; Zevachim 20a; Yad, Biyyath HaMikdash 5:14). A similar mechanism may have existed in the Tabernacle (see Torah Sh'lemah 38:6).\nAround 25 pounds.\n(Septuagint). Deror in Hebrew. Or, 'free of impurities' (Ibn Janach; Radak, Sherashim); or 'wild' (Ramban; Bachya). On the basis of Semitic cognates, some suggest 'flowing' or 'congealed into pearls.'\n(Raavad, Kley HaMikdash 1:3; Ramban; Bachya; Septuagint). Mor in Hebrew. Myrrh is a gum resin produced by trees and shrubs of the family Burseracea, most notably Commiphora myrrha, Commiphora abysinica, and Commiphora schimperi. The resin is obtained from Arabia and adjacent Africa, and is taken from the small, prickly gray-barked trees. Pearls of myrrh are brown, red or yellow, with an oily texture, becoming hard and brittle with age. It has a pleasing fragrance, very much like balsam, and a lasting, bitter, aromatic taste, hence the name mor, which signifies bitterness.\nAccording to many authorities, however, the mur here is not myrrh but musk (Saadia; Yad, Kley HaMikdash 1:3; Abarbanel; cf. Radak, Sherashim; Ibn Janach). This is an extract taken from the musk deer (Moschus moschiferus) which lives in Nepal and Tibet (see Ibn Ezra).\n|two half portions|\n(Rashi, Kerithoth 5a; Bachya; Ralbag; cf. Yad, Kley HaMikdash 1:2). According to Josephus, however, it would be translated, 'a half portion...' (Antiquities 3:8:3).\n(Rashi; Septuagint; Abarbanel, Canela in Spanish; Ibn Janach; Rambam on Kerithoth 1:1, but see Ramban on Exodus 30:34). Kinman in Hebrew. This is the dried bark of the cinnamon tree, Cinnamomum zeylanicum, a species of laurel cultivated mainly in Ceylon (cf. Yad, Kley HaMikdash 1:3; cf. Theophrastus, Plants 9:7; Herodatus 3:111).\nAccording to others, however, the kinman of the Bible is aloeswood or lignum aloes (Radak, Sherashim; cf. Saadia; see Ramban on Exodus 30:34). This is the resinous hartwood, Aquilaria agallocha of the family Thymalaeaceae, which grows in the East Indies and tropical Southeast Asia, and is still used for incense and perfumes.\nAccording to other ancient sources, the 'cinnamon' of antiquity was not the Ceylonese product, but an herb coming from Arabia (Theophrastus, History of Plants 9:4; Strabo 16:778; Diodorus Sicculus 2:49, 3:46) or Ethiopia (Pliny 12:42). Some identify it with 'Mecca Straw' (paja de Mecca in old Spanish; Ramban; Abarbanel), which was used as fodder for camels (Shir HaShirim Rabbah on Exodus 4:4). There are also indications that the 'cinnamon' of antiquity grew in the Holy Land (Yerushalmi, Peah 7:4; Bereshith Rabbah 65:17; see Kaftor Va Pherach 10, 31a).\nKeneh bosem in Hebrew. Ancient sources identify this with the sweet calmus (Septuagint; Rambam on Kerithoth 1:1; Saadia; Ibn Janach). This is the sweetflag or flag-root, Acoras calamus which grows in Europe. It appears that a similar species grew in the Holy Land, in the Hula region in ancient times (Theophrastus, History of Plants 9:7). Other sources apparently indicate that it was the Indian plant, Cympopogan martini, which has the form of red straw (Yad, Kley HaMikdash 1:3). On the basis of cognate pronunciation and Septuagint readings, some identify Keneh bosem with the English and Greek cannabis, the hemp plant.\nThere are, however, some authorities who identify the 'sweet cane' with cinnamon bark (Radak, Sherashim). Some say that kinman is the wood, and keneh bosem is the bark (Abarbanel).\n(Radak, Sherashim; Peshita; Vulgate). Kidah in Hebrew; ketzia in Aramaic (Targum; Rambam on Kelayim 1:8). Cassia is the common name for the bark of the tree Cinnamomum cassia or Cassia lignea belonging to the laurel family, which grows in China. (Pachad Yitzchak, s.v. Ketoreth; cf. Pliny 12:43; Theophrastus, History of Plants 9:7; Diodorus Siculus 3:46; Herodatus 3:110).\nThere are some, however, who identify the 'cassia' of the ancients, and hence kidah here, with costus, known as kosh't in the Talmud (Yad, Kley HaMikdash 1:3; Saadia; Ibn Janach; cf. Rashi). Costus is the root of the annual herb, Sausurea lappa, which grows on the mountain slopes of Kashmir, and is used for incense and perfume.\nThe Septuagint translates kidah here as iris, possibly Castus speciosus. Others suggest that it is kitto or mosylon, a plant very much like cassia, coming from Meuzel on the African coast (cf. Dioscorides, De Materia Medica 1:13).\nHin in Hebrew. Actually 0.97 gallon, or 3.6 liter.\nThe anointing oil was made by soaking the aromatic substances in water until the essential essences are extracted. The oil is then placed over the water, and the water slowly cooked away, allowing the essences to mix with the oil (Yad, Kley HaMikdash 1:2; from Kerithoth 5a). According to another opinion, the oil was cooked with the aromatic herbs, and then filtered out (Ibid.).\nSee note on Genesis 17:14.\n(Yad, Kley HaMikdash 2:4; cf. Kerithoth 6a; Rashi; Radak, Sherashim; Saadia; Rambam on Kerithoth 1:1). Nataf in Hebrew. Some say that nataf denotes the wood of the balsam, rather than the sap (Ramban). Balsam is also known as tzori in Hebrew (see Genesis 37:25). It is derived from the balsam tree, Commiphora opobalsamum, known as kataf in the Talmud, which grows wild in Yemen and around Mecca.\nThe Septuagint translates nataf here as stacte, which some identify as storax gum (Pachad Yitzchak, s.v. Ketoreth; cf. Dioscorides, De Materia Medica 1:79). However, the Greek word can also mean 'an oozing substance', very much like the basic connotation of nataf, and hence, it can denote any gum (thus, stacte can also denote myrrh; Pliny 12:75). It can thus denote balsam gum as well.\nShecheleth in Hebrew. The Targum translates this as tufra, the Talmud as tziporen (Kerithoth 6a), and the Septuagint as onyx, all denoting 'fingernail.' Some maintain that this is a spice actually prepared from human fingernails (cf. Arukh s.v. Tziporen), but most authorities see it as coming from an aquatic animal (Mossef HeArukh ibid.; Ramban). It is therefore usually identified as onycha (Hirsch; King James) or blatta byzantia (Abarbanel; Shiltey Gibborim 85), the fingernail-like operculum or closing flap of certain snails of the murex family, such as the Onyx marinus, Strombus lentiginosus, or Unguis Odaratus (Tifereth Yisrael, Chomer Bakodesh 2:67; Cf. Ben Sirah 24:15, Dioscorides, De Materia Medica 2:10). This emits a very pleasant smell when burned.\nOther sources, however, state that shecheleth is a kind of root (Rashi). The Talmud also appears to indicate that it came from an annual plant (Kerithoth 6b). Some identify this plant with a species of rock-rose, Cistus ladaniferus, which has fingernail-like petals.\nThe onycha was rubbed with an alkali solution prepared from the bitter vetch (Vicia sativa) (cf. Rambam on Maaser Sheni 2:4) to remove all impurities. It was then soaked in the fermented juice of the caper berry (Caparis spinosa) (see Tosafoth, Betza 25b, s.v. VeTzalaf) or strong white wine to enhance its fragrance (Kerithoth 6a; Yad, Kley HaMikdash 2:5).\n(Rashi; Septuagint). Chelbanah in Hebrew. It is a yellow-brown gum resin obtained from the Persian plant, Ferula galbaniflua (Pliny 12:56,24,13; Dioscorides, De Materia Medica 3:97). Alone it had a pungent, almost unpleasant odor (Kerithoth 6b).\nAccording to some, the chelbanah here is the gum of the common storax tree (Rambam on Kerithoth 1:1).\nOr oliban. (Septuagint). Levonah in Hebrew. This is a gum resin from trees of the genus boswellia, most notably Boswellia carterii and Boswellia frereana from Arabia, and Boswellia serratae from India. The gum is yellowish and semi-transparent, with a bitter nauseous taste. It is hard and capable of being pulverized, producing a strong aromatic odor when burned.\n|all of the same weight|\n(Targum; Kerithoth 5a; Rashi; Saadia). Or, 'each ground separately' (Ibn Ezra; cf. Yad, Kley HaMikdash 2:5).\n|other specified fragrances|\nBy tradition, an additional 7 fragrances were added, besides the four mentioned here, to give a total of eleven.\nThe formula for the incense was given in terms of the maneh which was 100 shekels or 5 pounds. It was\n70 maneh 350 lb. Balsam\n70 maneh 350 lb. Onycha\n70 maneh 350 lb. Galbanum\n70 maneh 350 lb. Frankincense\n16 maneh 80 lb. Myrrh\n16 maneh 80 lb. Cassia\n16 maneh 80 lb. Spikanard (shiboleth nard)\n16 maneh 80 lb. Saffron (karkom)\n12 maneh 60 lb. Costus (kosh't)\n9 maneh 45 lb. Cinnamon\n3 maneh 15 lb. Cinnamon bark\nThe total amount was 365 maneh, so that one maneh (5 lb) could be burned each day of the solar year.\nBesides these ingredients, 1/4 kav (1 cup) of Sodom salt (nitrate) and small amounts of maaleh ashan (probably Leptadenia pyrotechnica, which contains nitric acid) and kippath ha-yardan (probably cyclamen) were added.

Bacon salt makes a great gift, too!\nThis post may contain affiliate links. Please see our disclosure statement.\nWhat Is Bacon Salt?\nReal bacon salt is a versatile, extra tasty, high-quality seasoning made from crisply cooked bacon, salt and sometimes, additional spices or flavorings.\nWhy This Recipe is Worth Making\n- It’s super easy to make.\n- With this tasty mix on hand, you can add BACON FLAVOR to virtually anything!\n- A jar of homemade bacon salt makes a wonderful gift.\n12 Great Ways to Use Bacon Salt\nThere are so many ways you can add a savory, salty flavor punch to your favorite foods. Here are some of our favorite ways to use bacon salt:\n- As a fantastic popcorn topping\n- Rim salt for a Bacon Bloody Mary\n- Sprinkled on baked or mashed potatoes\n- Tossed with sunflower seeds and nuts\n- Shaken over corn on the cob\n- Sprinkled on grilled steaks, chicken or chops\n- As a zingy topping for scrambled eggs\n- To flavor cooked vegetables\n- As a topping on macaroni and cheese\n- To enliven the flavor of grilled burgers\n- A pinch before baking on your favorite chocolate chip cookies\n- Sprinkled on a caramel or hot fudge sundae\nIngredients and Substitutions\nLean bacon – For the best result, choose the leanest bacon you can find which will give you the most porky bacon flavor in the mix. We used center cut bacon for this batch, which generally has less fat than regular bacon. Because you’re going to cook the bacon extra crispy, regular sliced bacon works great. You can substitute thick sliced bacon and just cook it longer until it’s very crispy.\nKosher salt flakes – Because salt is one of two main ingredients, getting the right type will make a huge difference. We prefer salt crystals such as Maldon Sea Salt Flakes or Diamond Crystal Kosher Salt. These flaky salt crystals have wonderful flavor and less sodium than regular salt.\nLiquid Smoke flavoring – This natural flavoring, which is made from condensed smoke, enhances the flavor of the bacon and helps it stand up to the salt in the mix. You can skip this ingredient if you don’t have it on hand or don’t want to use it, and the bacon will still be very tasty and just a bit less smoky.\nFreshly ground black pepper – adds a slightly spicy flavor to the mixture.\nPastry brush – We like a nonabsorbent silicone pastry brush for strong flavors like the Liquid Smoke.\nFood processor, spice grinder or strong blender fitted with a metal blade\nStep by Step Instructions\nPreheat the oven to 350 degrees F and arrange the bacon strips on a foil-lined baking sheet fitted with an elevated baking rack.\nBrush the bacon lightly with the Liquid Smoke and sprinkle it with the pepper.\nCook the bacon in a 350 degree oven until browned and very crispy. Drain the bacon thoroughly on paper towels and blot to remove every bit of excess grease. Cool.\nCrumble the cooled, drained bacon in the bowl of the food processor or grinder.\nPulse the grinder or food processor until it is finely ground.\nAdd the salt and pulse until combined. The bacon salt is ready when the mixture is ground together in small pieces.\nTransfer to a lidded glass jar or shaker.\nHomemade Gift Ideas\nA jar of Bacon Salt is a thoughtful holiday or hostess gift for your favorite bacon lover. Put it in a decorative jar and tie with a festive ribbon or red and white baker’s string.\nA jar of this tasty seasoning is a gift that’s popular with guys and perfect for someone who loves to grill. Put the salt in a mini Mason jar and tuck it in a basket with grilling tongs, a thermometer, a fireproof oven mitt and your favorite barbeque sauce.\nWhen stored in the refrigerator in a sealed container, bacon salt will keep its amazing flavor for at least 4 weeks.\nPut it in a sealed container, such as a jar with a lid, and keep it in the refrigerator.\nYes!

{"question":"Compare the range capabilities of the VC-118A from the 1960s and the modern C-5M Super Galaxy transport aircraft - how do they differ in their ability to reach distant destinations?","answer":"The VC-118A had a maximum range of 4,000 miles, while the C-5M Super Galaxy has an unrefueled range of 5,250 nautical miles (9,723 km) when carrying 120,000 lbs of cargo. The C-5M's superior range comes from its modernized features, including new GE F138 turbofan engines that provide 22% more thrust and greatly enhanced fuel efficiency compared to older aircraft. These improvements allow the C-5M to serve as America's premier global direct delivery weapons system, capable of linking directly to warfighters in all theaters of combat through 2040 and beyond.","context":["Minicraft 1/144 C-118A\nIn the 1960’s, during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, many airports could not yet accommodate large jet powered aircraft such as the Boeing 707-based Air Force One VC-137C. For trips into these smaller airports, the President used a VC-118A transport, known by its tail number “3240.”\nHaving previously served as a transport plane for President Eisenhower’s Secretary of Defense, during the Kennedy administration 3240 received the same two-toned presidential paint scheme as the VC-137C. Even when the President did travel on board VC-137C, 3240 often went along in a support role or as a back up plane.\nLength: 106 ft. 9 in.\nWingspan: 117 ft. 6 in.\nTail Height: 28 ft 9 in\nEngines: Four Pratt and Whitney R-2000 @ 2,400 hp each\nTakeoff Weight: 108,000 lbs\nMaximum Range: 4,000 miles\nCeiling: 27,200 ft.\nSpeed: 265 mph cruising, 360 mph max\nOverall, I like Minicraft kits. The parts generally have minimal flash and fit together well. The kits are generally good, albeit simple, renditions of their subject aircraft, with no interiors.\nBest of all, Minicraft has excellent decals. The subjects are well rendered. The decals are thick, unquestionably opaque, and hold up very well under Micro Sol solution making it easy to get them to nestle down into and around complex curves. (A big plus on this kit.)\nI also like the fact that Minicraft cabin windows are usually represented with black decals rather than molded in. It’s just easier sliding decals than dealing with all those clear parts and masking, etc. But I find it curious that the cockpit windows on Minicraft kits are usually molded clear, as they are on this kit. However, this kit did provide a black cockpit window decal to enable you to black-out the cockpit windows to match the rest of the plane, which I did.\nThe instructions are thorough – two pages containing eight diagrams, noting when and when not to glue, and indicating right next to the drawing what colors small parts or assemblies should be painted. There’s also a diagram of the parts sprues. The third page on the back has a very good painting/decal diagram for both sides and the top and bottom of the aircraft.\nIt’s best to always check references for proper markings as painting/decal diagrams may have minor inaccuracies, as did this one. (There are black leading edges on the propellers. More on these later.) Most of the time simply typing in the designation, i.e., “VC-118A,” or nickname, i.e., “3240,” or “Air Force One,” of the aircraft into Google Images will find plenty of reference pictures, as it did with this aircraft.\nThe kit has three white plastic parts sprues and a single clear part, the cockpit windshield/roof. One plastic sprue contains the left and right fuselage halves and upper wing halves. The second contains the lower wing half. The third contains all the other smaller parts to construct the engines, landing gear, gear doors, and rear wings, etc. Again, some had minor flash to be lightly sanded, but nothing out of the ordinary.\nAfter first gluing a good size fishing weight into the nose cavity so the finished plane will sit properly on its tri-landing gear, I clamped the two fuselage halves together and bonded them with a few touches of Zap CA super thin glue, letting capillary action draw it along the seam.\nUnlike in the instructions, I preferred to complete the entire fuselage first, so the clear cockpit window/roof section was attached next with thick super glue, and then sanded to get the surfaces to align after first covering the windshield frame lines with masking tape to preserve the scribed surface detail.\nThe next thing to be done on the fuselage was to fill the factory scribed front and rear passenger doors on the model with thick super glue. They are not properly shaped or placed and are way too thick for this scale. Furthermore, decals are provided to simulate the doors anyway.\nNext came the wings. After dry-fitting to check the fit, I decided to put the front wing bottom on the fuselage first. Then I attached the upper wing halves to the bottom of the wing and to the plane on each side where I used thick super glue to attach them to the wing roots and fill the minor gaps at the same time which I subsequently sanded smooth. The rear wings were molded as single pieces and required only very light sanding around the edges and were attached with a drop of thin super glue in the receiving holes. I then attached the air scoop on the belly as instructed and the smaller antennae parts, #’s 62 & 63, as per my references on the lower left forward fuselage.\nNote: This plane has a bare metal exterior which means a silver or metallic paint finish. These finishes reveal any imperfections which are even more noticeable at small scales like 1/144. I used Flex.i.File sanding sticks, working down to and including the #3210 Polisher/Finisher to a very smooth finish. I then draw a Metallic Silver Sharpie marker along the seams to reveal any tiny gaps requiring extra attention with super glue and more sanding. After cleaning up all the seams, I re-scribed any sanded down panel lines across the top and bottom of the fuselage with my #11 blade.\nNext, I cut and cleaned up all the engine parts and propeller parts, including the propeller hubs. The engine cowlings are molded in two halves with the engine pistons molded as a third piece to be set inside. I made sure to mate the correct engine halves together. Each engine has exhaust ports on one side only, the other sided being smooth. When the engines are attached to the plane, the exhaust ports go on the outermost sides of the plane respectively.\nTo achieve smooth round seams where the two engine halves meet both inside and outside, I glued them together and filled any gaps with thick super glue, then sanded the outside and twisted progressively finer grit small rolled sandpaper sheets back and forth inside the cowling until the seams disappeared under my silver pen. After dry-fitting, I then inserted the piston part from the back with thin super glue. Then I dry fit all the engines and propellers to each other and to the aircraft and left the engines and propellers off for painting separately and attachment later.\nNext, I cut and cleaned the landing gear pieces, tire/hubs, and gear doors. Then I dry fit them to each other and to the aircraft and left these pieces off for painting separately and attachment later.\nMy references showed two prominent antennae on the roof of the plane. I scratch built these two “fin” antennae from sheet styrene stock. I attached the antennae with droplets of super glue. (See my technique in the final assembly section below.)\n|COLORS & MARKINGS|\nThis kit requires both metallics and colors. For the metallics, I used the Alclad ll metal painting system. For those not familiar, the Alclad system consists of a black primer coat, which dries as smooth as glass, over which the metallic carrier coats are sprayed. You can also spray the metallic carrier over high gloss paint finishes as well, which I did on this kit for the leading edge of the tail fin over the white gloss paint. While the primer requires at least 24 hours to cure, the subsequent metallic carrier coat(s) dries within a half hour and then may be masked and painted over if needed.\nI made a makeshift handle out of a coat hanger by cutting it on each side of the hook, then twisting masking tape around each of the three “prongs” and bending them to fit into each of the three landing gear openings. This allowed me to prime, paint and hang to dry without ever having to touch or set the plane down.\nThe instructions only indicate basic general colors, e.g. Polished Aluminum, White, Black, and Steel. For the metal surfaces I used Alclad #105 Polished Aluminum and #112 Steal. For the colors, I used enamels. I used Testors #1145 Gloss White on the fuselage top and #1149 Flat Black for the tires. While the painting diagram doesn’t show them, the box art and my references showed light gray sections on the top and bottom of the wings behind the engines. For these I used Model Master FS#36492 Light Gray\nI almost always make actual size copies of the decal sheet. In this case, they particularly came in handy as templates to determine where to mask along the separation line between the white top and natural metal bottom of the fuselage. I cut out each entire side decal copy and trimmed it right on the bottom edge of the stripe lines. I lined up the decal copy with the rear wings and below the cockpit window frames scribed on the model to get the required alignment and I taped them in place. I then slightly folded back the decal template and masked under the stripes. Afterward, I spot checked by holding my thumbnail at the bottom of the windows and folding back the template. I should always see masking tape to know I didn’t mask too high and that the decals will cover the line between white and metal when I put them on.\nThe following how I primed, masked and airbrush painted the aircraft:\n1. White Primer, then Gloss White Paint:\n· Mask front and rear wings\n· Spray entire fuselage and tail\n2. Alclad Primer:\n· Mask upper fuselage as described above\n· Spray bottom of fuselage\n· Front wings; top & bottom\n· Rear Wings Top and bottom\n· Engines, propellers and propeller hubs\n· Landing gear and gear doors\n· Tire hubs\n3. Alclad Polished Aluminum:\n· Spray bottom of fuselage\n· Front wings\n· Rear wings\n· Masked then sprayed the tail fin leading edge (the carrier will work fine on the smooth gloss white surface)\n· Engines, propellers and propeller hubs\n· Landing gear and gear doors\n· Tire hubs\n4. Alclad Steel:\n· Masked then sprayed engine exhaust sections of the cowlings\n5. Light Gray:\n· Mask front wings; sections behind/around engines, top and bottom\n· Spray front wing sections\n· Mask and spray lower halves of the propellers\n6. Flat Black:\n· Carefully hand-brushed the tires around the aluminum hubs\nFirst, I attached the four engines to the plane, ensuring that the exhaust ports went on the outermost sides of the plane respectively.\nNext, I assembled and attached the landing gear, struts, and gear doors. Doing so with just a tiny drop of super glue is an extremely delicate task. Precise placement of these often tiny parts without unsightly gobs of glue is always difficult at the 1/144 and smaller scales. For this reason I find the use of a “third hand” indispensable. Available at most hobby shops and on-line, it is a small stand with a heavy iron base and one or more ball joint mounted arms with alligator-type spring clamps to hold a part in any angle required. I use them in combination with plastic hemostats (i.e., scissor clamps,) so as not to scratch the part, to position and then hold these small parts in place while the super glue dries, as using super glue accelerant may mare the finish and maybe even dissolve surrounding paint. (This is how I attached the antennae earlier.)\nAs mentioned, the kit provided excellent decals. But placement is challenging. The key to getting the proper alignment of the decals is to start with the front blue decals around the cockpit. Getting them placed properly is crucial as the rest of the decals going back down the fuselage align to these front decals. I used the scribed cockpit window frames on the model as a guide and used plenty of the red Micro Sol “for highly irregular surfaces” as these decals must conform completely around the cockpit.\nThe fuselage decals are delivered one for each side, with the “United States of America” above the windows/blue, gold & white trim lines, extending from the front decal all the way down the side to fit above/around the rear tail wing root areas. When in place they should cover the separation line between the white upper fuselage and bare metal lower fuselage and because these decals are so thick and opaque there was nowhere that the separation lines showed through. (Man, I love Minicraft decals!)\nAgain, on this kit Minicraft provides black cockpit window decals to cover the clear cockpit windows (which I had previously painted over with the white gloss paint.) I used these decals so as to match the black cabin windows. I first carefully trimmed away the clear carrier film connecting them before floating, and then placed them one by one inside the scribed cockpit window lines. I then trimmed and placed the blue window framing decals between/around the black window decals.\nI placed the blue tail fin decals, flag decals, and tail number decals on each side of the tail fin. Checking my references, I used my dividers to ensure the proper spacing between the top of the tail fin and the top of the flags and the base of the tail fin and the bottom of the flags. This ensured both were in the same spot on each side. Then I used the dividers to make sure the tail numbers were the same height from the base of the tail fin on each side.\nOn the front wings, I trimmed the clear carrier film from around/inside each letter in the “USAF” and then using the decal copy as a template, I placed each USAF and the insignias on the top and bottom of the appropriate front wings as instructed.\nWith the cockpit decals in place, I put the matching light blue decals on the tips of the front gear doors. Then I carefully painted the exposed nose section #1149 Flat Black up to the bottom of the cockpit window frames. I also touched the tips of the bottom antennae with black as well as the “openings” of the engine intakes to simulate these holes.\nI finished with the propellers. The red, white, & blue tip decals took a lot of red Micro Sol to get the front and back decals to join together and nestle down around the blade tips. Finally, my references showed that the leading edges of each propeller blade have a black leading edge. I imitated them with black stripe decal with lots of Micro Sol on each blade. When done, I attached the propeller hubs on each propeller with a touch of thin super glue.\nAfter letting the decals dry over night I gave the entire model a coat of Future to give it a gloss finish. I then “weathered” the engines a bit with a “wash” of black paint and thinner. I then set in the propellers.\nI enjoyed the kit. It’s a fairy easy kit to build, but with some slightly tricky masking, painting, and decal placement. It should be a good challenge/practice for a beginner (especially bare metal finish and the decals around the cockpit) and a fun build for the intermediate (me) to expert modeler.\n· Planes of the Presidents: An Illustrated History of Air Force One; Bill Holder; Schiffer Military History Books, Atglen, PA, 2000\n· Various/numerous web sites for reference photos, generated by search engine entries on each plane’s military designation, callsign, and/or nick name, i.e., “C-118A” and/or “Air Force One” into Google Images.

We’ve worked very hard to ensure the C-5Ms are the absolute best strategic airlifters possible for our armed forces».\nAn Air Force Reserve Command aircrew from the 439th Airlift Wing at Westover Air Reserve Base, Massachusetts, ferried the final C-5M Super Galaxy to Stewart Air Force Base, New York, where the aircraft will undergo interior paint restoration. Once that work is complete, the aircraft will be flown to Westover where it will be the eighth C-5M Super Galaxy assigned to the base.\nLockheed Martin began RERP development work in 2001. RERP incorporates more than 70 improvements that improve reliability, efficiency, maintainability and availability. RERP included changes or modifications to the airframe structure; environmental and pneumatic systems; hydraulic systems, electrical system; fuel system; landing gear; and flight controls.\nThe heart of the system is the GE F138 turbofan engine (known as a CF6-80C2L1F in the commercial world) de-rated to 50,000 pounds/22,680 kg of thrust on the C-5M Super Galaxy. This engine provides 22 percent more thrust than the out-of-production TF39 turbofans on the earlier C-5A/B/C aircraft. The engines also allow the C-5M Super Galaxy to meet the FAA’s (Federal Aviation Administration) Stage 4 noise reduction requirements.\nThese changes, taken together, result in a 22 percent increase in thrust, a shorter takeoff roll; a 58 percent improvement in climb rate; allows the C-5M Super Galaxy to cruise – at maximum gross weight – in the Communication/Navigation/Surveillance/Air Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) flight environment; and greatly enhanced fuel efficiency and less tanker support demand.\nFirst flight of a modified aircraft to the C-5M Super Galaxy standard came in Marietta, Georgia, on June 19, 2006. The first operational C-5M Super Galaxy was delivered to Dover Air Force Base, Delaware, on February 9, 2009. A total of 49 C 5Bs, two C-5C aircraft, and one original C-5A was modified under RERP.\nThe C-5M Super Galaxy holds 89 FAI-certified (Fédération Aéronautique Internationale) world aviation records, the most by any aircraft type. These records include time-to-climb with payload, altitude with payload, and greatest payload carried.\nThe C-5 Galaxy has been operated solely by the U.S. Air Force since 1970 and is the largest strategic airlifter in the U.S. Air Force’s fleet. The C-5 Galaxy is capable of carrying two 78-ton M1A1 main battle tanks or helicopters and other large equipment intercontinental distances. Fully loaded, a C-5 Galaxy has a gross weight of more than 800,000 pounds/362,874 kg. All of the C-5s were built at Lockheed Martin’s Marietta site.\nIn addition to Westover, C-5Ms are assigned to active duty and Air Force Reserve Command units at Dover Air Force Base, Delaware (436th and 512th Airlift Wings) and Travis Air Force Base, California (60th and 349th Air Mobility Wings). The C-5 aircrew training squadron is part of the 433rd Airlift Wing, the Reserve wing at Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland, Texas.\nC-5M Super Galaxy\nThe C-5M Super Galaxy aircraft is a game changer to the warfighter and America’s premier global direct delivery weapons system. It is also the Air Force’s only true strategic airlifter. While setting 86 world records in airlift, the C-5M Super Galaxy established new benchmarks in carrying more cargo faster and farther than any other airlifter.\nA venerable workhorse, the recognized improvements in performance, efficiency and safety it provides validate the tremendous value to the taxpayer in modernizing proven and viable aircraft. As the only strategic airlifter with the capability of carrying 100 percent of certified air-transportable cargo, the C-5M Super Galaxy can carry twice the cargo of other strategic airlift systems. The C-5M Super Galaxy also has a dedicated passenger compartment, carrying troops and their supplies straight to the theater. It can be loaded from the front and back simultaneously, and vehicles can also be driven directly on or off the Galaxy. This means the C-5M Super Galaxy can be loaded quickly and efficiently.\nThe C-5M Super Galaxy has been a vital element of strategic airlift in every major contingency and humanitarian relief effort since it entered service. The C-5M Super Galaxy is the only strategic airlifter capable of linking America directly to the warfighter in all theatres of combat with mission capable rates excess of 80 percent. With more than half of its useful structural life remaining, the C-5M Super Galaxy will be a force multiplier through 2040 and beyond.\n|Primary Function||Outsize cargo transport|\n|Prime Contractor||Lockheed-Georgia Co.|\n|Crew||Seven: pilot, co-pilot, 2 flight engineers and 3 loadmasters|\n|Length||247.8 feet/75.53 m|\n|Height||65.1 feet/19.84 m|\n|Wingspan||222.8 feet/67.91 m|\n|Power Plant||4 × General Electric CF6-80C2 turbofans|\n|Thrust||50,580 lbs/22,942.7 kgf/225 kN|\n|Normal cruise speed||Mach 0.77/518 mph/834 km/h|\n|Unrefueled Range with 120,000 lbs/54,431 kg||5,250 NM/9,723 km|\n|Max takeoff weight (2.2 g)||840,000 lbs/381,018 kg|\n|Operating weight||400,000 lbs/181,437 kg|\n|Fuel capacity||332,500 lbs/150,819 kg|\n|Max payload (2.0 g)||285,000 lbs/129,274 kg|\n|Length||143.7 feet/43.8 m|\n|Width||19 feet/5.79 m|\n|Height||13.48 feet/4.11 m|\n|Unit Cost||$90 million (fiscal 2009 constant dollars)|\n|16 C-5Ms have been delivered through December 2013|\n|52 C-5Ms are scheduled to be in the inventory by fiscal 2017|"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"chinese_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:1161494b-4ea4-49a7-81db-05f3b73e5d9f>","<urn:uuid:5debac80-67c2-4668-8a62-4b4c09511056>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What feeding adaptations have evolved in Herring Gulls versus Brown-headed Cowbirds, and how do these relate to their respective habitats?","answer":"Herring Gulls and Brown-headed Cowbirds have evolved distinct feeding adaptations suited to their environments. Herring Gulls are opportunistic coastal feeders with multiple specialized techniques - they plunge-dive for fish, patrol shorelines, drop shellfish on rocks to break them open, and scavenge from fishing boats. They've even been observed using tools, with one gull documented using bread as bait to catch goldfish. They possess special glands above their eyes that allow them to drink seawater by excreting excess salt. Brown-headed Cowbirds, historically associated with bison on the Great Plains, developed as ground feeders following grazing herds and eating insects stirred up by the animals. This nomadic lifestyle following herds is believed to have contributed to their evolution as nest parasites. Today, they've adapted to forage in mixed flocks with other blackbirds, searching through dead leaves for seeds and invertebrates, and have successfully expanded their range as humans have created more open and fragmented habitats.","context":["THE \"BLACK VAGABOND\"\nCome April each year, we're always delighted as the first spring migrants begin appearing at Hilton Pond Center. Blue-gray Gnatcatchers, Eastern Phoebes, Indigo Buntings, and Ruby-throated Hummingbirds are among our earliest arrivals, and there's always a big spike in the number of Chipping Sparrows visiting our feeders--although we haven't determined if these little rusty-caps migrate in or are local residents with sudden yearning for white millet. Another species that seems to crave millet is one whose presence we welcome because of its fine plumage but would rather not have around due to its lifestyle. We speak here of a \"Black Vagabond\"--the Brown-headed Cowbird--a social parasite whose proclivity for depositing eggs in other birds' nests can have significant impact on songbird populations.\nAll text & photos © Hilton Pond Center\nBrown-headed Cowbirds (male, above) have been seen around Hilton Pond in all months of the year, but never predictably nor in large numbers. During cold weather they tend to congregate with other blackbirds, so it's not unusual a few times each winter to have a flock of a thousand Common Grackles, Rusty Blackbirds, and cowbirds descend on the property to plow through dead leaves in search of seeds and invertebrates. Usually, about 95% are grackles and sometimes a few European Starlings are in the mix. When spring approaches, these foraging flocks disintegrate as former participants start hanging with their own kind. Most of the blackbirds eventually pair off, but Brown-headed Cowbirds have a different social system--one in which both sexes are promiscuous. In fact, we've found one of the best ways to catch male cowbirds is to use live females as bait. Many times a female in one of our ground traps have attracted the attention of a half-dozen or so males who got snared themselves when they tried to get at a potential mate.\nIt may be that a female cowbird (above) HAS TO have more than one male, for in a given breeding season she lays an egg a day for perhaps 10-12 days, takes a few days off and lays a dozen more, and then recycles once again before finishing with a total of up to three dozen eggs. This fecundity is much greater than typical passerines and is a significant accomplishment for a bird that doesn't even build a nest. It seems the female Brown-headed Cowbird is quite adept at watching another bird construct a nest into which she places her own cowbird egg before moving on to lay her next day's egg in some OTHER victim's nest. Indeed, the cowbird's scientific name alludes to this failure to establish its own nest as a home base and to its appearance; the generic name Molothrus means \"vagabond,\" while the species epithet ater is Latin for \"black,\" referring to body plumage of the male.)\nAlthough some birds remove cowbird eggs from their nests, many such as vireos and warblers simply incubate the cowbird egg with their own. The cowbird egg develops--often getting a head start by hatching a day ahead of its nestmates--and the cowbird chick quickly becomes the dominant bird in the brood. Since surrogate parents feed the aggressive cowbird first, it grows more rapidly and achieves maximum size--perhaps two or three times that of its foster mother and father. If you're a diminutive warbler, it may take all your energy to raise this giant, gluttonous interloper--especially since a cowbird fledgling (left) will continue to beg for food and might prevent foster parents from having a second brood. This scenario has caused birds such as the once-common Yellow Warbler to undergo significant population reductions--so much so that some songbird species have vanished from parts of their original range.\nBirdwatchers and environmentalists sometimes debate whether Brown-headed Cowbirds are \"native\" to the Carolinas, or whether human activity has drawn them in from elsewhere. We frequently refer to them as \"buffalo birds\" to emphasize they likely originated in the Great Plains, where they followed American Bison from place to place, eating insects stirred up by grazing herds. (As a reflection of this, Lewis and Clark referred to cowbirds as \"buffalo-peckers.\") However, there WERE expanses of prairie in the Carolina Piedmont--especially in the vicinity of the modern-day counties of York (SC) and Mecklenburg (NC); there also were a good many bison in the Carolinas prior to the arrival of European settlers. It's quite interesting that when the Brown-headed Cowbird was first described by science, the description was based on a specimen collected in South Carolina by early French explorers and written up by naturalist Louis-Jean-Marie Daubenton (1716-1800). He called the cowbird Troupiale, de la Caroline--the Carolina Oriole--an appropriate name because brightly colored orioles, like cowbirds, are in the Blackbird Family.\nEven before Daubenton, Mark Catesby in his 1731 edition of Natural History of Carolina, Florida, and the Bahama Islands rendered a female \"Cowpen Bird\"--shown above right with a male \"Towhe-bird.\" Catesby wrote:\nNOTE: We wonder if Catesby depicted together the Eastern Towhee (which he called Passer Niger, Oculis Rubris or \"black bird with red eye\") and the Brown-headed Cowbird (Passer Fusca or \"dusky bird\") because he thought they were somehow related. In reality, towhees are sparrows (Emberizidae) and cowbirds are blackbirds (Icteridae), but because both have black bills that are more or less conical, these two ground-feeding birds might look superficially similar.\nObviously, based just on the work of Catesby and Daubenton, there were at least small populations of cowbirds present in Colonial America, but we suspect across the eastern U.S. they are much more common today than 275 years ago. Humans have altered the landscape significantly, cutting down dense forest and replacing it with farmland and grazeland more suitable to cowbirds. Most important, habitat fragmentation has enabled cowbirds to enter areas where they did not occur historically; not only is there more space but now they can parasitize nests of new species they never encountered on the Great Plains or Piedmont Prairies. Unlike prairie nesters, these new victims--especially woodland breeders--did not evolve with cowbirds as social parasites, so they likely have no natural defenses against such parasitization.\nAlthough some birders have knee-jerk reactions against the cowbird's parasitic behavior, having the bird in the hand gives a different perspective. The seemingly black dorsal plumage of the male Brown-headed Cowbird becomes a metallic abstraction (above), with shades of cobalt blue and green glinting like gun steel. The female's back feathers (below)--more loosely structured--are drab by comparison, but even they have hints of greenish iridescence. Nonetheless, the overall mousey gray-brown color of the female cowbird undoubtedly makes her less noticeable as she spies on potential nests in which to place her eggs.\nSo how did Brown-headed Cowbirds become social parasites in the first place? One hypothesis is that following buffalo herds made cowbirds true wanderers; such a lifestyle interfered with nest-building and made it advantageous to be able to lay eggs that other species would end up tending. However, other kinds of birds also have been known to lay an egg in the nest of foster parents, and none of them follow grazing animal herds. It seems more likely social parasitism arose because gravid female birds have to put the egg somewhere; if a female is far from her own nest when her egg is ready--or if her nest was destroyed by a predator or weather--the female might seek out another's nest for the deposit. If her chick then survives under care of foster parents, over time such serendipitous egg-laying might become the norm and, eventually, a necessity. Any bird that lays an \"extra\" egg in the nest of another pair is technically a social parasite; cowbirds merely take the behavior to the extreme, including not ever building a nest of their own.\nThere's no question their non-nest-building lifestyle has enabled Brown-headed Cowbirds to do pretty well in a changing environment. Experts with Partners In Flight estimate there are 56 million cowbirds in the U.S., Canada, Mexico, and parts of the Caribbean, placing them in the category of \"Least Concern\" with regard to survivability. And many cowbird individuals are assertive--witness our need to wear a leather glove to photograph one especially aggressive male (below left)--which means they get at least their share of food when they flock together with other blackbirds and starlings. Females are careful observers of other species when they need nests in which to lay their eggs, but cowbirds are even more resourceful than one might think--as discovered recently by Jeffrey Hoover and Scott Robinson. The two ornithologists described a \"cowbird mafia,\" i.e., female cowbirds that \"trash\" nests from which the host bird has removed a cowbird egg. Such behavior \"encourages\" protective host birds not to mess with a cowbird egg lest their own future progeny get roughed up. Furthermore, some female cowbirds destroy a nest and steal the host's eggs BEFORE laying their cowbird eggs, thereby forcing the host to build a new nest. Since second clutches are typically smaller, this may mean fewer host bird nestlings are present to compete when the cowbird finally lays her own egg in the newly constructed nest.\nLove 'em for the color and unusual gurgling song, or hate 'em because they lay eggs in the nests of other birds, one has to admire Brown-headed Cowbirds for their resourcefulness and survival skills. With 56 million of them scattered around the Western Hemisphere, we suspect they are here to stay, so we might as well study them a little more closely to see what other secrets they might reveal. To that end we've banded 361 cowbirds at Hilton Pond Center since 1982, with 90 of those captured between January and June 1988; none ever returned in a later year or showed up elsewhere.\nOne thing we wonder is whether--with all those male cowbirds trying to breed promiscuously with all those females--who actually gets to mate? Can younger, second-year males--identifiable in-hand by the pale and sometimes ragged condition of their underwing coverts (above)--still impress a female when they spread their wings in courtship display, or do only older males have the right moves to win over a female long enough to copulate? To us these are interesting questions whose answers might be easier to acquire at Hilton Pond if our Brown-headed Blackbirds weren't such vagabonds with no place they call home.\nAll text & photos © Hilton Pond Center\nComments or questions about this week's installment?\nBe sure to scroll down for an account of all\nThanks to the following fine folks for recent gifts in support of Hilton Pond Center for Piedmont Natural History and/or Operation RubyThroat: The Hummingbird Project.

Special glands located over the eyes allow them to excrete the salt that would otherwise dehydrate most animals, including us. The salty excretion can be seen dripping out of their nostrils and off the ends of their bills.\n- The Herring Gull has extended its breeding range southward along the Atlantic Coast, and may be displacing the more southern Laughing Gull from some areas. At the northern end of its range, however, the Herring Gull is itself being displaced by increasing numbers of the Great Black-backed Gull.\n- Young Herring Gulls appear to be more migratory than adults. In some areas, such as the Great Lakes, most adults remain near their breeding grounds, but the nonbreeders move father south in the fall.\n- Breeding brings special dietary challenges for Herring Gulls. During courtship, males feed their mates, losing fat reserves in the process. Then egg-laying reduces the females’ protein and bone calcium, and they seek out marine invertebrates and fish to replenish stores. After chicks hatch, both parents feed them day and night for up to 12 weeks, splitting foraging shifts to offer each chick up to half a pound of food per day as it nears fledging.\n- Sibling rivalry is a problem in the bird world, too. The third chick in a Herring Gull clutch can have it especially tough. While the first two chicks hatch the same day, the third is born a day or two later, weighs less, gets less food, and grows more slowly.\n- Incubating Herring Gulls often pant to cool off. They orient their bodies to keep darker plumage out of direct sun as best they can, but short of dipping their feet and legs into water, their mouth lining is their best means of shedding heat.\n- An adult Herring Gull was spotted bait-fishing. It floated bits of bread on the surface of a Paris pond and attacked goldfish feeding on the bread. It ate none of the bread itself, indicating deliberate tool use.\nHerring Gulls' scavenging habits take them to open water, intertidal pools and shallows, mud flats, landfills, newly plowed fields, picnic grounds, and fish-processing plants. They roost and loaf, often in large mixed species groups, in open areas with good visibility for spotting predators, including agricultural and athletic fields, beaches, parking lots, airport runways, and garbage dumps. They breed near lakes in northern forests across Canada to Alaska and in some coastal areas. Colonies often form on isolated islands, barrier beaches, and marshy hummocks, which are safe from terrestrial predators (though aerial predators can still be a danger). City rooftops, for example, serve the same purpose.\nHerring Gulls prey on marine invertebrates, fish, insects, smaller seabirds, and even on adults, young, and eggs of other gulls. Along rocky shores, they take mussels, crabs, sea urchins, and crayfish. On mudflats, they seek worms, small clams, and mussels. In open water, they follow large predators (including fishing boats) that bring small fish, squid, and zooplankton to the surface. Newly plowed fields provide ready supplies of earthworms and other invertebrate prey. Herring Gulls are opportunistic scavengers on fish, carrion, and trash. Individual gulls often specialize on a food type. Most choose marine invertebrates like crabs, sea urchins, or clams, even though fresh-caught fish make their most calorie-, protein-, and fat-rich meals by far. In spite of this apparently poor choice, these gulls have the largest, heaviest eggs and the highest hatching success rates. The opportunism of gulls extends to raiding nests of other seabirds, and one or two males per large breeding colony may even specialize in cannibalizing chicks of others in the colony.\n- Clutch Size\n- 1–3 eggs\n- Number of Broods\n- 1 broods\n- Egg Length\n- 2.6–3 in\n- Egg Width\n- 1.9–2.1 in\n- Incubation Period\n- 31–32 days\n- Nestling Period\n- 45–50 days\n- Egg Description\n- Light olive, buff, or greenish with darker splotches or speckling.\n- Condition at Hatching\n- Eyes open, covered in thick gray down with black spots; able to move around nesting area after several hours.\nSeveral days before egg-laying, pairs hollow out up to four depressions 10–15 inches across with central depressions 4–8 inches wide and about the depth of an egg. They line the scrapes with vegetation, feathers, plastic, rope, or other materials. The pair chooses the final nest from these alternates. After the female lays her eggs, the pair continues to add vegetation to this nest throughout the monthlong incubation. Sand nests are sometimes left unlined or only sparsely lined.\nHerring Gull pairs pick nesting sites together in the soft soil, sand, or short vegetation of their territory. To protect the nest from prevailing winds and hide it from predators, it is usually placed next to a rock, log, or bush. This also hides it from the nearest neighbors. Crevices may be used as nest sites in rocky areas.\nHerring Gulls patrol shorelines and open ocean in widely scattered groups, soaring raptor-like and spiraling down to pick scraps off the surface. Individuals plunge-dive from near the surface and dip while paddling to take shallow prey. Rallying around fishing boats or refuse dumps, they are raucous and competitive, threatening and stealing from other birds. They'll prowl tide flats seeking out invertebrates, gobbling small items whole, picking apart larger prey, and dropping shellfish onto rocks to break them open. Tighter groups follow foraging whales, groups of dolphins, or schools of large fish in open water, hovering to nab small prey driven to the surface. Their opportunistic scavenging punctuates hours of bathing, preening, and “loafing” near food sources. (“Loafing” is a term behaviorists use to describe a bird that isn’t doing much of anything; many seabirds spend long hours this way.) Males establish breeding territories and both members of a bonded pair defend it with threatening postures, warning calls, and chase-attacks in air and on ground. Courtship rituals include mate-feeding, and pairs remain bonded as long as both live. They return to the same territories each breeding season and share the work through a month of incubation and three months of chick-raising. One parent is always at the nest until the chicks are at least a month old.\nLarge populations of Herring Gulls inhabit much of the Northern Hemisphere. Human activities are the main threats to local populations. For example, Atlantic Coast populations were nearly wiped out in the late 1880s by hunters seeking feathers and eggs. But by the 1980s, their numbers had increased tenfold to more than 100,000 pairs. Conservation movements ended exploitation in many areas, though numbers had shrunk so far that hunting became unprofitable anyway. Other changes inadvertently aided recovering populations. Increasing numbers of coastal fishing boats in the 1930s dumped \"garbage fish\" and waste, providing a rich new food source. The growing number of onshore refuse dumps also attracted gulls but probably had mixed effects, since chicks fed human refuse show poorer survival rates. Whaling, the destruction of dolphin and porpoise populations, and intensive fishing of larger fish like cod and salmon decreased competition for the smaller fish that gulls favor. More recently, however, continued overfishing has made even these smaller fish less numerous. And changing fishing practices have meant less waste from fishing boats. Oil pollution, pesticide contamination, and deliberate control measures have threatened some Herring Gull populations.\n- Pierotti, R. J., and T. P. Good. 1994. Herring Gull (Larus argentatus).

For noise pollution, efforts are focusing on developing strategies to limit and reduce anthropogenic noise that affects marine mammals. For overfishing, several measures are being implemented: governments are working to regulate all fishing activities, protected areas are being established in oceans where fishing is prohibited, and there are efforts to rehabilitate fishermen who rely solely on fishing for their livelihood. Additionally, education initiatives are being undertaken to reduce overfishing impacts.

Also, there are a lot of people for whom fishing is a source of income. With the growing population, the demand for fish is also going up. This means that on a daily basis, fish are being captured from their marine habitats. Fishing is already a multimillion-dollar industry and a thriving business for many. So, we have technology helping men dive deeper and catch more fish. But are we ‘Overfishing’? If yes, then what are the effects of overfishing?\nWhat is Overfishing?\nHuman beings capture fish for food. But fish also reproduce. Simply put, overfishing occurs when the number of fish being caught is more than the number of fish being reproduced and it is one of the ways humans are effecting ecosystems. With the increase in demand, catching more fish to feed the demand seems obvious. However, we need to be aware of the impact it could have.\nGeneral Effects of Overfishing\nFor many years, human beings have considered oceans as a never-ending source of fish. But it wouldn’t do to ignore that fish, like every other resource on earth, are finite.\nIf the number of fish go down significantly, fishing as a viable option of livelihood is no longer possible or profitable. This could mean closing down of fisheries and loss of business for the stakeholders.\nRisk of losing a food source\nThis is an obvious impact of overfishing. With the number of fish in the oceans dwindling, one day, there might be no fish left for human consumption. This is significant since many people east fish as their staple food.\nPolluting the marine environment\nWith a lot of fishermen out in the ocean, oil spills and other pollutants cause damage to the marine life. Many fish die in the ocean as a result of this.\nSometimes, fishermen lose their nets inside the oceans. Fish inadvertently get caught in these nets and die inside the oceans. With such a large number of fishing activities being carried out, the number of fish dying due to ghost fishing could be significant.\nEven though worrying, the above effects are only the tip of the iceberg. The effects of overfishing on the marine ecosystem are given below.\nEffects of overfishing on the marine ecosystem\nScientists believe that the hazard to the marine ecosystem by overfishing is cause for more concern than other obvious threats like environmental pollution.\nRisk to the marine biodiversity\nUnsustainable and unchecked fishing practices have driven many fish stocks to the verge of collapse. Several species of fish with commercial value such as the Atlantic Tuna fish are now an endangered species on the verge of extinction. Extinction of any living species on the earth causes and imbalance and has a huge impact on the ecosystem.\nThe following list gives the names of some of the species of fish have been put under danger of extinction due to overfishing. There are many others, too.\n- Orange roughy\n- Atlantic sardines\n- Skipjack and Yellowfin tuna\n- Atlantic and Pacific cod\nAlteration of the food chain\nUnchecked overfishing harms the physical environment in the oceans and breaks or distorts the food chain. This impacts all the living organisms in the food chain in some way or the other. The consequences of this disproportion could be widespread, and not good!\nEffect on the well-being of coral reef\nCoral reefs are an important element of the marine ecosystem. Damage to coral reefs has severe impacts on the ocean life and the effects are virtually irreversible.\nAlgae is a part of the marine life and is essential for the balance in the marine ecosystem since many fish and sea creatures feed on algae. However, with declining number of fish, there is a probability of disproportionate algae growth which can be harmful for the oceans.\nThe way ahead\nThe problem of overfishing is not easy. But the risks involved are too high to ignore the problem. Below are some of the solutions to check unregulated fishing. This is already being done, but the rules should be enforced strictly if we really want to see a change.\n- Obviously, efforts need to be taken to restore the marine life balance and to curb the effects of overfishing. All fishing should be appropriately regulated by the governments.\n- Where fishing is the only source of livelihood, alternate rehabilitation of the fishermen should be carried out.\n- Educating everyone involved can also go a long way in bringing down overfishing.\n- Protected areas should be setup in the ocean where fishing is prohibited."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:522f1349-1a47-4221-bbe1-7f2356d2d597>","<urn:uuid:86fd455d-a807-4e25-a18c-fa0f577f3804>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the key differences between breaking and entering and burglary crimes, and how are they classified in terms of severity?","answer":"Breaking and entering of a dwelling (as defined in Rhode Island law) involves entering any dwelling house or apartment without the owner's consent, regardless of intent, and is punishable by 2-10 years imprisonment for first offense and 4-15 years for subsequent offenses, plus possible fines up to $10,000. Burglary, as defined in the FBI's index offenses, specifically requires unlawful entry with the intent to commit a felony or theft. Both are serious crimes, with burglary being classified as a Part I or index offense by the FBI, indicating it is considered both serious and frequently reported.","context":["An Overview of the System\nADAM J. MCKEE\nSection 1.3: Defining and Measuring Crime\nA crime is an act or omission that is prohibited by law. To be a good law, a particular punishment or range of punishments must be specified. In the United States, the most common punishments are fines and imprisonment. As a matter of legal theory, a crime is a failed duty to the community for which the community will exact some punishment. This is the reason that prosecutions are always brought forward by the government, as a representation of the community that government serves. Historically, legal scholars differentiated between things that were “wrongs in themselves,” which were referred to as mala in se offenses. These were distinct from mala prohibita offenses, which represented acts that were criminal merely because the government wished to prohibit them. Many criminal justice scholars use these terms to differentiate between heinous crimes like rape and murder and victimless crimes such as gambling and vagrancy.\nFelonies, Misdemeanors, and Violations\nToday, the most common and most basic division of crimes is based on the seriousness of the offense, and thus the possible punishment. Misdemeanors are less serious crimes that are punishable by fine and confinement in a local jail for a period not to exceed a year. Felonies are more serious crimes that the government punishes by fines, imprisonment (most commonly under the auspices of the state’s Department of Corrections) for a period exceeding a year, or death. The distinction between misdemeanors and felonies is of ancient origin, coming to us through the Common Law of England. Common law felonies included murder, rape, mayhem, robbery, sodomy, larceny, arson, manslaughter, and burglary.\nWhat is classified as a misdemeanor largely depends on the jurisdiction. Common examples are petty theft, prostitution, public intoxication, simple assault, disorderly conduct, and vandalism. Some crimes can be both misdemeanors and felonies, depending on the circumstances. A battery that results in a handprint on the victim’s face may be classified as a misdemeanor, while a kick that breaks the victim’s ribs may be a felony. Similarly, an arson that does relatively little damage (in terms of financial costs) may be a misdemeanor, while an arson that destroys a home will be a felony. These distinctions have made it into our popular culture, where criminals who commit felonies are often known as felons. Less commonly used is the term misdemeanant, who is a person convicted of s misdemeanor.\nMost jurisdictions recognize a class of offenses that do not result in any period of incarceration and are punished with only a fine. These minor breaches of the law are usually called violations. We will delve much deeper into the particulars of what constitutes various crimes in a later section.\nIn order to understand crime and the criminal justice system, we need to understand the prevalence of crime. Good crime statistics are critically important to understanding crime trends. The more federal and state agencies know about crime trends, the more intelligently they can allocate precious resources and maximize efforts at crime suppression and prevention. Crime statistics are also frequently used as an evaluation tool for justice programs. If the rate of a particular crime is falling, then what the system is doing will seem to be working. If the rate of a particular crime is rising, then it will seem to indicate that the criminal justice system is failing.\nIn the United States, the most frequently cited crime statistics come from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports (UCR). The UCR is composed of crime data collected by over 16,000 local and state law enforcement agencies on crimes that have been brought to the attention of police. These law enforcement agencies voluntarily send information to the FBI, which compiles them into an annually published report along with several special reports on particular issues.\nLearn More Online\nTo learn more about the Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) and the National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), visit the FBI’s UCR page at:\nSince its inception in the 1930s, many people have been critical of the UCR system for a variety of reasons. Among these reasons are the facts that the UCR includes only crimes reported to the police, only counts the most serious crime committed in a series of crimes, does not differentiate between completed crimes and attempts, and does not include many types of crimes, such as white-collar crimes and federal crimes. Another critical complaint (especially among scholars) was that the UCR did not obtain potentially important information about the victim, the offender, the location of the crime and so forth. Without this information, social scientists could not use the UCR data in attempts to explain and predict crime. These complaints eventually led to the development of a much more informative system of crime reporting known as the National incident-BasedReporting System (NIBRS).\nThe NIBRS is an incident-based reporting system in which agencies collect data on each single crime occurrence. NIBRS data come from local, state, and federal automated records’ systems. The NIBRS collects data on every single incident and arrest within 22 offense categories made up of 46 specific crimes called Group A offenses. For each of the offenses coming to the attention of law enforcement, specified types of facts about each crime are reported. In addition to the Group A offenses, there are 11 Group B offense categories for which only arrest data are reported.\nAccording to the FBI, participating in NIBRS can benefit agencies in several ways. The benefits of participating in the NIBRS are:\n- The NIBRS can furnish information on nearly every major criminal justice issue facing law enforcement today, including terrorism, white collar crime, weapons offenses, missing children where criminality is involved, drug/narcotics offenses, drug involvement in all offenses, hate crimes, spousal abuse, abuse of the elderly, child abuse, domestic violence, juvenile crime/gangs, parental abduction, organized crime, pornography/child pornography, driving under the influence, and alcohol-related offenses.\n- Using the NIBRS, legislators, municipal planners/administrators, academicians, sociologists, and the public will have access to more comprehensive crime information than the summary reporting can provide.\n- The NIBRS produces more detailed, accurate, and meaningful data than the traditional summary reporting. Armed with such information, law enforcement can better make a case to acquire the resources needed to fight crime.\n- The NIBRS enables agencies to find similarities in crime-fighting problems so that agencies can work together to develop solutions or discover strategies for addressing the issues.\n- Full participation in the NIBRS provides statistics to enable a law enforcement agency to provide a full accounting of the status of public safety within the jurisdiction to the police commissioner, police chief, sheriff, or director.\nThe major problem with NIBRS today is that is has not been universally implemented. Agencies and state Programs are still in the process of developing, testing or implementing the NIBRS. In 2004, 5,271 law enforcement agencies contributed NIBRS data to the UCR Program. The data from those agencies represent 20 percent of the U.S. population and 16 percent of the crime statistics collected by the UCR Program. Implementation of NIBRS is occurring at a pace commensurate with the resources, abilities, and limitations of the contributing law enforcement agencies.\nA commonly cited problem with the UCR is that there are many, many crimes that do not come to the attention of police. This is not limited to minor offenses. For example, it is estimated that nearly half of all rapes go unreported. These undocumented offenses are often referred to as the dark figure of crime. This is the reason that the United States is the Bureau of Justice Statistics’ (BJS) developed the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS). The NCVS, which began in 1973, provides a detailed picture of crime incidents, victims, and trends. Today, the survey collects detailed information on the frequency and nature of the crimes of rape, sexual assault, personal robbery, aggravated and simple assault, household burglary, theft, and motor vehicle theft. It does not measure homicide or commercial crimes (such as burglaries of stores).\nTwo times a year, U.S. Census Bureau personnel interview household members in a nationally representative sample of approximately 42,000 households (about 75,000 people). Approximately 150,000 interviews of persons age 12 or older are conducted annually. Households stay in the sample for three years. New households are rotated into the sample on an ongoing basis.\nThe NCVS collects information on crimes suffered by individuals and households, whether or not those crimes were reported to law enforcement. It estimates the proportion of each crime type reported to law enforcement, and it summarizes the reasons that victims give for reporting or not reporting.\nThe survey provides information about victims (age, sex, race, ethnicity, marital status, income, and educational level), offenders (sex, race, approximate age, and victim-offender relationship), and the crimes (time and place of occurrence, use of weapons, nature of injury, and economic consequences). Questions also cover the experiences of victims with the criminal justice system, self-protective measures used by victims, and possible substance abuse by offenders. Supplements are added periodically to the survey to obtain detailed information on topics like school crime. BJS publication of NCVS data includes Criminal Victimization in the United States, an annual report that covers the broad range of detailed information collected by the NCVS.\nLearn More Online\nTo learn more about the National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), visit the BJS Criminal Victimization page at:\nThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) designates certain crimes as Part I or index offenses because it considers them both serious and frequently reported to the police. The Part I offenses are defined as follows:\nCriminal homicide: Murder and nonnegligent manslaughter: the willful (nonnegligent) killing of one human being by another. Deaths caused by negligence, attempts to kill, assaults to kill, suicides, and accidental deaths are excluded.\nForcible rape: The carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will. Rapes by force and attempts or assaults to rape, regardless of the age of the victim, are included. Statutory offenses (no force used-victim under age of consent) are excluded.\nRobbery: The taking or attempting to take anything of value from the care, custody, or control of a person or persons by force or threat of force or violence and/or by putting the victim in fear.\nAggravated assault: An unlawful attack by one person upon another for the purpose of inflicting severe or aggravated bodily injury. This type of assault usually is accompanied by the use of a weapon or by means likely to produce death or great bodily harm. Simple assaults are excluded.\nBurglary (breaking or entering): The unlawful entry of a structure to commit a felony or a theft. Attempted forcible entry is included.\nLarceny-theft (except motor vehicle theft): The unlawful taking, carrying, leading, or riding away of property from the possession or constructive possession of another. Examples are thefts of bicycles, motor vehicle parts, and accessories, shoplifting, pocket-picking, or the stealing of any property or article that is not taken by force and violence or by fraud. Attempted larcenies are included. Embezzlement, confidence games, forgery, check fraud, etc., are excluded.\nMotor vehicle theft: The theft or attempted theft of a motor vehicle. A motor vehicle is self-propelled and runs on land surface and not on rails. Motorboats, construction equipment, airplanes, and farming equipment are specifically excluded from this category.\nArson: Any willful or malicious burning or attempt to burn, with or without intent to defraud, a dwelling house, public building, motor vehicle or aircraft, personal property of another, etc.\nAggravated Assault, Arson, Burglary, Common Law Felonies, Criminal Homicide, Dark Figure of Crime, Felon, Forcible Rape, Index Offenses, Larceny-theft, Mala In Se, Mala Prohibita, Misdemeanant, Motor Vehicle Theft, National Crime Victimization Survey (NCVS), National Incident-Based Reporting System (NIBRS), Omission, Rate, Robbery, U.S. Census Bureau, Uniform Crime Reports (UCR), Victimless Crime, Violation\nLast Modified: 08/06/2018\nThis work is licensed under an Open Educational Resource-Quality Master Source (OER-QMS) License.","As reported in the April 7, 2015 edition of the Providence Journal, a Bristol Police officer was arrested and charged with breaking and entering of a dwelling house and misdemeanor larceny.

{"question":"Compare how society's preventive responses to tuberculosis in the early 1900s and the automation trends accelerated by COVID-19 are reshaping work and society.","answer":"Both phenomena led to significant societal transformations, though through different mechanisms. Tuberculosis prevention focused on isolation, building institutions, and improving general immunity through better living conditions - a largely physical and environmental response. In contrast, COVID-19 accelerated automation trends, pushing society toward increased robotization and digital transformation. This has led to a reduction in low-skill jobs while creating more middle and high-skill positions requiring cognitive, non-routine tasks. Both situations demanded adaptation: tuberculosis through physical prevention measures, and COVID-19 through workforce upskilling and technological advancement.","context":["Much like crises of the past, the coronavirus pandemic will leave a lasting footprint on society, causing us to rethink how we live, work, and learn.\nAs we transition to distance learning, we need only look at other pandemics to see how deadly outbreaks recalibrated the economy and ways of life.\nHistorical Impact of Pandemics on the Future of Work\nThe Black Death ravaged Europe in the 14th century, but it is also credited with reorganizing the economic landscape. Mass labor shortages increased the bargaining power of workers, allowing them to win two to three times pre-plague pay and shorter working hours.\nSimultaneously, the countryside, once host to the centuries-old feudal system, saw mass migration to urban areas by peasants, giving birth to a middle class and the shift of power away from feudal lords.\nFinally, labor shortages and the rise in cost per worker also led to the invention of labor-saving devices like the printing press, ship rigging systems, and agricultural harvesting tools.\nThe 1918 Influenza, also known as the Spanish Influenza, raged throughout the world from 1918 to 1919 infecting one-third of the global population.\nCrippling the workforce and increasing the value and bargaining power of workers, a 2007 study by Thomas Garrett, an economics researcher, concluded that the 1918 Influenza led to an increase in wages and per capita income, especially in regions most impacted by outbreaks.\nThe 2002 and 2003 SARS outbreak in East Asia, though it did not reach pandemic levels, also left a lasting impact on the economy of affected countries, and in particular China.\nSocial distancing practices led to a massive boom in the ecommerce sector for consumer goods as more people shopped online and grew wary of more public markets and shopping centers. In addition, the outbreak also instigated a rise in internet connectivity as well as cell phone usage, connecting millions electronically.\nA New Economic Future\nIn all of these cases the pandemic accelerated economic forces already in play. Therefore, to understand how the coronavirus will impact the future of work for students, it is necessary to assess the economic trends already in motion and whose evolutions are expedited in this crisis.\nIn this article, we will break down three of these trends and describe how they will impact students and the skills they will need in the future.\nPrior to the coronavirus, companies and people were increasingly embracing automation because of its ability to cut out redundancies and busy work, which saves time, shifts focus to what’s more important and critical, and invents new ways to grow and perform.\nNow in the wake of this pandemic, it is likely that automation will be accelerated because declines in revenue make human capital more expensive.\nTo understand which areas of the economy will be most impacted, a 2019 report by Brookings studied automation by industry and quantified the potential for jobs to be lost to automation within each.\nAs is demonstrated, automation tends to negatively impact low skill work (generally requiring a high school diploma) while creating opportunities for increased high skill (requiring at least a bachelor’s degree) and middle skill (requiring at least a high school diploma and technical training) positions.\nThis shift toward middle and high-skill jobs has been rising. A 2017 report by Burning Glass Technologies found:\n- High-skill jobs have 25 percent more job openings than qualified workers.\n- Middle-skill jobs have 13 percent more openings than qualified workers.\n- Low-skill jobs, however, have seven percent fewer openings than workers.\nEven when the pandemic comes to an end, hastened robotization is unlikely to reverse, so the growth in middle- and high-skill jobs and reduction in low-skill work will continue to manifest.\nWhat does this mean for students?\nGrowing middle- and high-skill positions are defined by cognitive, non-routine tasks that a machine simply cannot do. They require career readiness skills like problem solving, creativity, and critical thinking to sustain the new economy.\nThese new work opportunities also demand students learn how to learn. For example, a Dell Technology report found that 85 percent of forecasted jobs for 2030 still do not exist yet largely because technology is expanding so rapidly. Students are preparing for jobs that are yet to be imagined. When they graduate, they need to know how to adapt to the roles available to them.\nSimilarly, a Deloitte report finds that the half-life of skills is now five years and companies will need to invest in continual professional development for workers, meaning that career readiness skills entail knowing how to learn, adapt, and embrace change and ambiguity.\nShift Toward Remote Workspaces\nWhether mandated or urged to, millions of Americans are now working from home. Peter Schwartz, a futurist, explains:\n“We are conducting a natural experiment...One we would prefer not to have conducted. But we’re going to learn the hard way, rather quickly and by necessity, everything that can be done remotely. … We’re not going back to zero afterward. What do we learn out of all this in terms of how our society can change?”\nThanks to telecommuting technology, this trend has already been under way for years. In fact, a 2017 Gallup poll determined that 43 percent of Americans worked from home with some frequency. And by mid-March of this year, two-thirds of employers were transitioning to remote work environments.\nQuantifying this rapid transition, Kentik, a global provider of network analytics, found that video conferencing traffic has doubled since the outbreak began.\nWhen the outbreak is over, some people may return to offices. However, it is also likely that the benefits of remote work will tempt many to at least do it with more frequency if not permanently: greater work-life balance and flexibility throughout the day for employees in addition to cost-savings on overhead and recruiting benefits for businesses.\nMoreover, the coronavirus pandemic is proving that large-scale remote work is feasible, and it’s likely that this will prompt a continuation of this new approach.\nWhat does this mean for students?\nRemote workplaces have an increased premium on digital skills as well as social and emotional skills, requiring workers to adeptly use technology for the entirety of their business processes and to successfully collaborate and lead remotely.\nStudents need to develop basic digital skills to navigate digital interfaces, access the resources they need, and perform basic functions.\nThey also need organizational and project management skills to plan and execute projects online and in collaboration with others as well as advanced digital communication skills to work in conjunction with their coworkers across time zones to drive business processes forward. Finally, students will also need digital creation skills to build prototypes virtually, develop online programs to solve business problems, and construct systems using a suite of digital tools.\nStudents must learn to use technology – to troubleshoot it, to create with it, and to collaborate through it. At the same time, students need the opportunity to practice self-management, leadership, collaboration, and communication online.\nRise of Revision of Industries\nThe coronavirus pandemic disproportionately affects some industries over others. Joseph B. Fuller, the co-lead of Harvard’s Future of Work initiative, explains that air travel, hospitality, tourism, and high-end consumer retailers as well as events like sports, cinema, concerts, business conferences, and trade fairs are some of the most impacted. In addition, manufacturing, especially in sectors with long supply chains is also suffering.\nWhile the coronavirus will subside, it is likely that there will be permanent scars in these sectors. How will this collective experience change how we think about travel as a necessity or large gatherings as entertainment? Will manufacturing seek to shorten supply chains to prevent this catastrophic disruption in the future? Several experts confirm the likelihood of these cultural shifts.\nSimilarly, much like the SARS outbreak at the beginning of the century, coronavirus is driving people into their homes and online retail spaces. With stores shuttered, restaurants open only for delivery, trade shows cancelled, and business meetings postponed, consumers are finding products and services online. Therefore, companies not equipped to sell digitally are disadvantaged.\nEcommerce has been slowly outpacing brick-and-mortar shopping in the past few years, but as this pandemic subsides, this shift will likely keep hold as more consumers and businesses find it less time intensive and more cost efficient to buy and sell online.\nWhat does this mean for students?\nResulting from these industry shifts is the opportunity to innovate new ways to help people connect with each other and the world around them and to efficiently bring infrastructure, products, and services to market. Students will have the opportunity to problem solve these challenges. Problem-solving skills like computational thinking and design thinking along with competencies in collaboration, innovation, creativity, and programming will make these possible.\nChange and challenge are opportunities for creativity. We can empower students to thrive in this.","The world has experienced several devastating epidemics. One of the worst was the Spanish flu, that ravaged between 1918 and 1920. The epidemic probably killed more people than the First and Second World Wars together.\n“The Spanish flu is the main reason why we fear the corona virus today,” says Associate Professor Magnus Vollset, at the Department of Global Public Health and Primary Care, University of Bergen.\nThe Spanish flu was also a viral-disease, and became a global epidemic (pandemic) that killed 100 million people. In comparison, 18 million died in the First World War and between 60-85 million during the Second World War.\nNot from Spain\nInterestingly, the Spanish flu did not come from Spain, but from the USA. It was probably American soldiers who brought it to Europe during the First World War. Spain was a neutral country and did not have the same restrictions and censorship on media as the other larger nations. That meant they could publish freely about the epidemic.\nWhen King Alfonso XIII became ill in 1918, it received massive coverage in the newspapers. Later on, many members of the government were also infected.\n“Since all news about the deadly flu came from Spain, it was called “The Spanish Flu”,” Vollset explains.\nFatal for young and able-bodied\nIn Norway, which had a population of 2,6 million people at the time, around one million people were infected, of which 15000 died. This gives a mortality rate around 1,3 per cent, which is quite similar to the Corona outbreak. However, comparisons between the Spanish flu and the corona-pandemic, involve one major difference.\n“The COVID-19 seems to be mostly killing the elderly and vulnerable groups, whereas the Spanish flu also killed the young and employable. These young victims had not developed immunity from earlier flus,” Vollset point out.\nPerformed autopsies on frozen bodies\nThe Spanish flu epidemic was caused by a N1H1-virus (as the swine flu in 2009). That the flu was caused by a virus was not known until the beginning of the 1930s, when the virology was first established.\n“The reason we know the Spanish flu was caused by a virus so many years afterwards, is because one could perform autopsies on frozen bodies recovered from the permafrost they were buried in, “ Vollset explains.\nFocus on prevention\nEven if the Spanish flu caused many deaths in Norway, it is not the epidemic that killed most people. Tuberculosis has that honour. It is estimated that 250000 Norwegians died between 1895 and 1955 of the lung disease.\nAlthough tuberculosis is not caused by a virus, its impacts have some similarities to the current corona outbreak today. When tuberculosis was at its worst, there was not much that medicine could do for the patients. Antibiotics were not available until after the Second World War and the BCG-vaccine for all between 12 to 14 years of age was not given before 1947.\n“The focus that time was prevention, by isolating the ill, building institutions, campaigns against spitting, and strengthening general immunity by offering healthy food and living conditions. When the antibiotics came, tuberculosis was already more or less under control. Prevention works,” Vollset points out.\nBetter equipped today\nThere are several parallels between the outbreaks of corona, the Spanish flu and tuberculosis. There is no medicine or vaccine against corona, but we know how to avoid and reduce infection. If the population follows the advice given by the health authorities, we can reduce the chance for the corona virus to get completely out of control.\n“The most important thing now is to avoid having too many infected at the same time. This risks overloading the hospitals, and endangers the most vulnerable, says Vollset.\nVollset reminds us that we are much more prepared today than we were 100 years ago. When the Spanish flu hit Norway, the country had 0,4 doctors per 1000 inhabitant. Today we have 4,7 per 1000.\n“In addition to better medical preparedness and more knowledge on how to prevent infections, we have a population with better living conditions today, better immune systems, and a more highly educated population that can appreciate the need to follow health advice,” says Magnus Vollset.\nFacts: Big epidemics in Norway:\n- Cholera: From the 1830s. In Bergen, the worst outbreak occurred between 1848 – 1849, when 712 people died. In Norway, the worst epidemic was in 1853 when 2500 inhabitants died within a few months, 1600 of them in Christiania (Oslo).\n- Tuberculosis: Between 1895 and 1955, supposedly 250000 Norwegian died from the disease.\n- Leprosy: When Norway began its first national patient register, 2800 were infected. Since that time, 9000 Norwegians have been infected.\n- The Spanish flu: A global epidemic (pandemic) that hit large parts of the world between 1918 – 1920. The pandemic killed nearly 100 million people worldwide and 15000 in Norway.\n- After the Spanish flu, we have had these pandemics: the Asian flu (1967), the Hong Kong flu (1968), the Russian flu (1977) and the Swine flu (2009).\nThanks for reading Eurasia Review.

{"question":"How do seasonal patterns and environmental conditions affect the activity of Formosan termites versus carpenter bees?","answer":"Formosan termites and carpenter bees show distinct seasonal patterns influenced by environmental conditions. Formosan termites swarm in huge numbers in late spring or summer, typically following a warm rainy day, and prefer high humidity conditions from dusk to midnight. Their distribution is limited to southern areas because their eggs won't hatch below 20°C (68°F). They're found in states like Alabama, California, Florida, and others, generally not north of 35° N latitude. In contrast, carpenter bees become active in spring when they emerge from their winter nests to mate and build new nests. They then feed on plant nectar in late summer before retreating to their holes for winter. Both species have specific moisture requirements - Formosan termites need constant moisture sources, while carpenter bees target soft, unpainted wood that may be affected by environmental conditions.","context":["Economic Significance: Formosan termites are the most aggressive\nand destructive timber pests in the United States. It is an imported species,\nnative to China.\nIt can develop huge nests containing millions of termites aggressively\nand relentlessly seeking and devouring structural timbers, utility poles\nand other timber structures, including ships and barges. Infestation can\noccur to living trees, such as oak, cypress, pine and maple.\nThey often cause power failures by chewing through electrical cabling.\nA termite to be feared - it is known to cause major structural timber\ndamage to homes and buildings within a few months.\nArea of Distribution: The Formosan subterranean termite (Coptotermes\n) has now become established in South Carolina and other\nsouthern states. At least one colony has been found In California (1995).\nFormosan termites are a serious timber pest in Hawaii and coastal regions\nof Texas, South Carolina, Louisiana, South Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee,\nGeorgia, South Carolina and southern California, as well as, inland towns\nThe Formosan termite is rarely found North of 35° N latitude. They\nhave been reported from the following states: Alabama, California, Florida,\nGeorgia, Hawaii, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina,\nTennessee, and Texas. Their distribution will probably continue to be\nrestricted to southern areas because their eggs will not hatch below about\n20° C (68° F).\nIdentification of Swarmers and Soldiers: Formosan termites swarm in huge\nnumbers in late spring or summer; usually following a warm rainy day.\nThey prefer to swarm in times of high humidity in the evening hours from\ndusk to midnight. The swarmers are attracted to lights and are about 1/25'',\nincluding wings. Their body color is pale yellowish brown. A fontanelle\n(frontal gland pore) is present.\nThe swarmers have four wings of equal size with dark hard veins in the\nfront portion of the front wing. The wings are a translucent, slightly\nmilky color and covered with tiny hairs. The armoured head of the soldier\nis rounded tapering toward the front. A fontanelle (frontal gland pore)\nis present on the soldier's forehead. They have large mandibles relative\nto their body, which is flat and narrower than the head.\nWhen disturbed the Formosan soldier termite may emit a white sticky latex\nsubstance from it's fontanelle - a defensive measure to ensnare their\nenemies, primarily ants.\nIdentification of Timber Damage: Formosan termites eat mainly the springwood\nof susceptible timbers, most often leaving the summer wood sections. Timbers\ninfested by Formosan termites usually have layered sections packed with\nmoist soil in high activity areas.\nBiology and Habits: Formosan termites are subterranean termites that typically\nlive in the ground and a large mature nest will periodically emit swarmers\nin large numbers over a wide area to find a mate from another colony nest\nto start up a new colony. A suitable location for nesting should provide\na constant moisture source and a readily available timber food source\nSeveral years are required before the termite colony reaches the typically\nmature size, which may contain millions of termites foraging for timber\nfood sources within a 400 feet radius, actively feeding on trees and free-standing\npoles as well as buildings and other timber structures.\nThe colony nests of Formosan termites are usually located in the ground\nbelow the frost line, but above the water table. They typically construct\nmud galleries or \"shelter tubes\" across hard objects in order\nto gain access to timber food sources.\nFormosan termites constantly search for new food sources. They are known\nto enter buildings through cracks in concrete flooring or to travel under\nparquetry or tile flooring through gaps of less than 1/16\" wide.\nThe space between the foundation and the first mortar joint is often enough\nspace for termites to enter a home.\nFormosan termites can establish secondary colonies in very moist wood\nof upper stories of buildings (even several stories above ground) and\ndo not need soil contact if there is a nearly constant moisture source.\nWhere moisture regularly collects inside the wall or other cavities of\na building, say from faulty plumbing or broken roof tiles, the Formosan\ntermite can develop a subsidiary colony nest, which may not require contact\nwith the ground to ensure its survival. This is particularly prevalent\nin areas of high humidity where wood moisture is above average.\nDue to its size and aggressive foraging behaviour a colony of Formosan\ntermites does more damage than single colonies of other U.S. subterranean\nspecies, and can cause significant structural damage to a home within","- Other Rooms\n- Lawn & Garden\n- Deck & Patio\n- Repair & Install\nHow to Deal with Carpenter BeesBy: Julie Day\nChances are you’ve been buzzed by a large, intimidating-looking bee when working on the outside of your home. You may also have the telltale holes in your woodwork where these bees build their nests.\nAbout Carpenter Bees\nCarpenter bees are large black and yellow bees that resemble bumblebees. But while bumblebees are fuzzy all over; carpenter bees have a large, shiny, solid black abdomen.\nWhile they may look scary, male carpenter bees – the ones most likely to dive-bomb your head with a whitish spot on their face – don’t even have stingers, and females generally won’t sting unless you aggravate them.\nCarpenter bees get their names by the perfectly round, half-inch or so diameter holes that they drill in wood for their nests. In the spring, the bees emerge from their winter nests, mate, and set about building this year’s nest.\nThe female bee uses sharp teeth to excavate a perfectly round tunnel in soft wood, or she may choose instead to remodel an existing tunnel. She then lays her eggs in the tunnel, where they develop as her life cycle comes to an end.\nIn late summer, the new bees emerge to feed on plant nectar, then crawl back into their hole for the winter.\nCarpenter Bee Damage\nCarpenter bees prefer to excavate their nests in soft, unpainted wood – such as the back side of fascia boards, siding, window trim, and porch ceilings. They also bore into decks, outdoor furniture, fence posts, and swing sets. Softer woods – like pine, cedar, redwood, and cypress – are more attractive for nests while treated lumber and hardwoods are less inviting.\nThe holes typically go inward for about an inch, then the tunnel turns and follows the grain of the wood for about six more inches. The tunnel might branch into smaller ones that are shared by multiple bees.\nIn addition to tunnels, you might also find:\n- Fresh sawdust outside the hole.\n- Scraping sounds from inside the wood.\n- Fan-shaped stains outside the openings.\nIf your infestation is limited to a tunnel or two, there’s nothing to worry about. Even though they technically do bore into wood, carpenter bees don’t systematically destroy a structure like termites or carpenter ants.\nHowever, if the infestation is extensive or has been going on for years, the sheer number of tunnels can cause problems, including:\n- Woodpeckers: Insect eating birds can be drawn to the enticing sounds of bee nesting and larvae, which can invite much more severe damage.\nHow to Prevent Carpenter Bee Damage\nHere are some tips for making your home less attractive to carpenter bees:\n- Fill Cracks: Before painting or sealing, fill all cracks, nail holes, divots, and splintered wood with caulking or putty; since these are attractive starting places for bees.\nHow to Deal with Carpenter Bees\nIf the bees are already at work on your home:\n- Stay Alert: There’s no way to completely prevent or eliminate carpenter bees. But by taking these steps and staying alert to new activity, you can keep damage to a minimum.\n- Carpenter Bees (North Carolina State University)\n- Carpenter Bees (University of California Integrated Pest Management)\nPlease Leave a Comment\n6 Comments on “How to Deal with Carpenter Bees”\nYou can follow comments to this article by subscribing to the RSS news feed with your favorite feed reader.\nWe want to hear from you!

{"question":"Can you explain why granite surfaces develop small pits, and how does this relate to the hardness differences between its mineral components on the Mohs scale?","answer":"Small pits on granite surfaces form during the polishing process when Biotite and Muscovite (soft mica minerals) flake off. This occurs because these components are significantly softer than the main minerals in granite - Quartz (hardness 7) and Feldspar (hardness 6) as measured on the Mohs scale. While these pits don't affect the countertop's durability, they are a natural result of the varying hardness levels of granite's constituent minerals during processing.","context":["Granite is natural stone composed of several minerals tightly packed together. The main components include Feldspar and Quartz (both very hard) with a mix of other minerals including Biotite and Muscovite (soft mica). Feldspar and Quartz, both major components of granite, are harder than steel. That’s why granite is used as a building material by many. Biotite and Muscovite, the minor components of granite, give it that glittery appearance. They are also much softer and are frequently associated with pitting and fissures.\nThe elegance of granite countertops adds value to homes. Heat, scratch, and stain resistant, granite even outlasts the life of the home its installed in. Very little maintenance is required. Because of abundant supply, it’s more affordable than many people think.\nGranite is naturally formed all over the world, but major quarries are found in Brazil, India, Italy, Africa, Norway, Finland, and China. Most granite slabs used for kitchen countertops in the USA come from Brazil, where we get a lot of the slabs we use, and India.\nQuite the opposite. Granite countertops require very little maintenance. Clean them with a mild soap and warm water. Read our maintenance guide for more information.\nGranite withstands very high temperatures. Placing hot pans or kettles won’t cause any damage to the stone’s color or stability. Using trivets is a good idea whenever possible and are an absolute MUST under crockpots which sit on granite for an extended length of time. Long periods of concentrated heat can cause granite to crack.\nKnives can’t scratch true granite. The only thing harder is diamond. For example, diamond is scored 10 on the MOH’s hardness scale and granite is scored 7. Diamond blades are the only thing that can cleanly cut through granite. Other natural stones frequently called granites like Gneiss and Schist do not have a MOH score of 7, and those may be scratched by knives as can areas of softer minerals in granite. So always use a cutting board.\nThe abundant supply of natural granite along with modern technology make counter prices for entry level granite very affordable.\nYes, in most cases chips and cracks can be repaired by a granite fabricator.\nNo, the Center for Disease Control has not found evidence to suggest bacteria grows in or on granite.\nGranite has been tested for Radon emissions and found to emit very insignificant levels. It’s been found to be safe for use in homes without any harmful effects.You can read a more detailed report on this at the website of the Marble Institute of America.\nWe use 1 1⁄4” granite which is sturdy enough to be placed directly on the cabinets.<br />\nIt’s not uncommon to see some small pits on the surface of granite. These pits are formed during the polishing process, when some of the weaker components of granite, like Biotite, flake off from the surface. This happens at the granite processing plants in different countries where the granite is quarried and polished. The pits themselves don’t make it less durable or inferior for use in countertops, but the look and feel of the pits may bother some people. We can’t fill the pits because no compound can adequately or permanently fill these spaces without visually affecting the surface of the stone. The best practice is to discuss imperfections with your fabricator before selecting the stone. If you really hate the pits, ask about granite selections that have no visual imperfections.\nA good number of granite colors that are very beautiful with a variety of colors and veins that flow in different directions, are not truly “granites” in strict geological terms. Though they are commonly called granites, they are actually Gneiss or Schists stones. True granite stones scale between 6 and 7 on MOH’s scale of hardness. By comparison, the MOH’s scale for Gneiss and Schist is less than 6. In order to strengthen these stones to be used as countertops, they undergo a process called resinization, where epoxy resin is used to fill the weak spots. These slabs, with the visually filled lines, don’t break or crack once they are installed, with proper care. If any problems occur, they will happen during fabrication or transportation. Many exotic stones belong in this category. The filled areas are not defects but are required as part of the product.\nThe granite provided by us doesn’t have to be resealed and comes with a warranty against permanent staining under normal use. If staining material, like red wine, is not removed promptly there may be superficial staining which can normally be removed with a poultice.\nGranite slabs that are cut into particular sizes and have one edge that is polished. They are typically fabricated in countries with cheap labor, like China, and if you decide to use these, you will not have a custom fabricated countertop. Don’t expect the same quality of fit and finish with these or the same consistency of shade between pieces. We will not return to site for complaints on these issues.\nThe standard overhang is 1 1⁄2” from the face frame of the cabinets. This gives a good visual appearance because it creates a 3⁄4” overhang from the door fronts. You can compare this to the 1” overhang typical of the laminate countertops you are looking to replace with granite.<br /> The actual overhang may slightly vary depending on how straight the cabinets are installed. Having the cabinets not installed in a straight line is a common problem. Our template professionals discuss these issues with homeowners when they are visible at time of template.<br /> We can usually extend the 3 cm granite countertops up to a maximum of 10” from the cabinets, provided the total unsupported area is no more than 1/3 of the supported area. unsupported. We have to be careful when we install upper bar tops that sit on a 5” knee wall. These overhangs have to be supported by steel braces placed under the countertop and then screwed into the wooden studs in the knee wall. Any granite countertops with more than an 10” overhang should be adequately supported by steel braces. The placement of wood or metal supports that extend from the cabinets, sometimes called corbels, can hit your knees and may not be visually appealing. The ideal solution is to place steel bars, secured adequately, providing a permanent support that is almost invisible and does not hit your knees.\n12” is the ideal overhang for comfortable seating without hitting your knees on the cabinet. However, the overhang does need adequate support.\nDishwashers must be attached to the under surface of the kitchen countertop to prevent tipping the machine forward when the door is opened. The attachment also prevents vibration during the dishwasher’s operation. We attach the dishwasher with a well-designed bracket. This attachment is rigid enough to secure the dishwasher safely, while still allowing you to easily remove it in case you need to repair or replace the dishwasher in the future, without having to call a granite fabricator to do so. Newer dishwashers come with side attachment clips so that the dishwasher can be screwed to the cabinets instead. This should be done by your cabinet installer or remodeling contractor.\nYes. While replacing the existing laminate countertops, customers can choose to keep their current tile backsplash. However, you must consider the following points for better results: The thickness of laminate countertops is 1 1⁄2” and granite, marble, or engineered surfaces, like Silestone, are 1 1⁄4” thick. The replacement causes a visible gap of about 1⁄4” between the new granite countertop and the existing tile.<br /> This scenario applies in cases where the tile goes all the way down to the countertops. You can solve this problem by using one of these methods:<br /> -Plying caulk in the gap with a matching color to the existing grout. The new caulk line will be about a 1⁄4” thickness instead of the tile grout line of about 1/8”.<br /> -If you have kept the grout from the original tile installation, you can use that grout to fill the gap. This is the best case scenario.<br /> -You can purchase and install a trim line from tile supplier that fits between the tile and the granite countertop. This should be done by your tile installer.<br /> -Installation of a 4” back splash of granite over the existing tile is another option.<br /> In case the existing tile goes up to the 4” back splash of laminate countertop, 4” granite back splashes have to be placed between the granite countertops and the existing tile. We will custom measure these at the time of installation and they will minimize the gap between the tile and the backsplash. However, that will require a second visit to install.\nNo, you don’t need to buy full slabs. We consider the cost of actual material used in your project. That is one of the advantages of buying from us. Of course, we do have to make efficient use of the stone and therefore it is a requirement that final seam locations and utilization of the slab is at the discretion of the fabricator. If you decide you want a specific slab layout on a particular slab or slabs which involves more waste, then we can provide you with a price for that.\nAll stone seams can be seen and felt and granite will not match exactly at the seam. They will be around 1/8 of an inch wide. However, the goal of a good granite installation company is to make them as inconspicuous as possible.\nGranite weighs about 16 to 17 pounds per square foot.<br />\nThe stone countertops are places on the cabinets and, after ensuring everything is leveled, a bead of silicon is applied at the intersection of the cabinets and the underside of the stone. This is sufficient to hold the countertops in place in a normal situation. If the cabinets are not leveled, which is not uncommon, we have to place shims underneath the countertops to level them.<br /> To avoid shims the tops should be levelled to within 1/8 of an inch over 10 feet. We can install without this standard being met but will ask you to sign a waiver before we do it.\nNo. If you use 3cm (1 1⁄4”) thick granite, you do not need any special reinforcement. You may need some additional support in the corners of walls that our template specialist will be able to explain to you.\nNo, we do not level your cabinets. You will need the help of your carpenter or your contractor for that.\nWe are a production fabricator and our aim is to keep our costs low and our quality high. We ask that you look at the extensive selection in store and make some preliminary choices there. Then call us to make an appointment and we’ll gladly pull available colors from our inventory to show you. Because of the very wide range of colors available we don’t always have those colors in stock but will be happy to get them in for you to see before you commit.","Moh’s Scale of Hardness\nThere are two methods to measure the hardness of materials: scratch hardness and static load indentation hardness. Scratch hardness, also known as Mohs hardness, is a relative hardness and is rather rough.\nIt uses ten natural minerals as standards. The hardness order does not represent the absolute size of a particular mineral’s hardness, but indicates that a mineral of higher hardness order can scratch a mineral of lower order. The hardness of other minerals is determined by comparison with these standard minerals.\nThe unit of Mohs hardness is kilogram-force per square centimeter (kgf/cm²), denoted as [Pa]. It’s a standard for expressing a mineral’s hardness, first proposed in 1824 by German mineralogist Frederich Mohs. The hardness is represented by the depth of the scratch made on the surface of the tested mineral using the scratch method with a pyramid-shaped diamond needle.\nThe hardness scale is as follows: talc 1 (softest), gypsum 2, calcite 3, fluorite 4, apatite 5, orthoclase (also known as feldspar or periclase) 6, quartz 7, topaz 8, corundum 9, diamond 10 (hardest). Mohs hardness is also used to express the hardness of other solid materials.\nFor a more specific method: one would scratch the mineral to be tested against the standard hardness on the Mohs hardness scale to determine the hardness of the tested mineral.\nFor example, if a mineral can scratch calcite and be scratched by fluorite, then the hardness of that mineral is between 3 and 4. Alternatively, one can use a fingernail (hardness 2-2.5), a coin (hardness 3.5), or a small knife (hardness 5.5) to scratch the mineral in order to broadly determine its hardness.\n|Representative Mineral Names||Common Uses||Hardness Scale|\n|Talc, Graphite||Talc is the softest known mineral, commonly used in the form of talc powder.||1|\n|Skin, Natural Arsenic||1.5|\n|Nails, Amber, Ivory||2.5|\n|Gold, Silver, Aluminum||2.5~3|\n|Calcite, Copper, Pearls||Calcite can be used as carving material and industrial raw material.||3|\n|Fluorite (also known as Fluorspar)||Carving, Metallurgy, Building Materials||4|\n|Phosphorite||Phosphorus is an important component of biological cells; it is used as raw material in feed, fertilizer, and chemical production.||5|\n|Glass, Stainless Steel||5.5|\n|Orthoclase, Tanzanite, Pure Titanium||6|\n|Teeth (outer layer of crown)||The main component is hydroxyapatite.||6~7|\n|Soft Jade – Xinjiang Hetian Jade||6~6.5|\n|Pyrite||It is used as raw material for the production of sulfuric acid; gold refining; and can also be used in medicinal purposes.||6.5|\n|Hard Jade – Burmese Jadeite and Jade||6.5~7|\n|Quartz Glass, Amethyst||7|\n|Electric Stone, Zircon||7.5|\n|Quartz||According to the old hardness scale, quartz is rated as 7.||8|\n|Topaz, Chromium, Tungsten Steel||On the old hardness scale, topaz is rated as 8.||9|\n|Moissanite||Synthetic gems are 2.5 times brighter than diamonds and cost 1/10th of the price.||9.5|\n|Corundum||Corundum is rated as 9 on the old hardness scale. Natural gems such as rubies and sapphires are now considered types of corundum, as is the hardness of synthetic sapphire crystals.||12|\n|Diamond||Diamonds are rated as 10 on the old hardness scale, making them the hardest natural gem on earth.||15|\nWhat is Mohs Hardness?\nMohs Hardness is a standard that indicates the hardness of minerals, first proposed in 1824 by German mineralogist Friedrich Mohs. This standard is established by using a pyramid-shaped diamond drill to scratch the surface of a mineral, with the depth of the scratch indicating the hardness.\nThe hardness of a mineral refers to its ability to resist certain external mechanical forces such as scratching, indentation, or grinding. In mineralogy, the hardness often referred to is Mohs hardness, which is the scratch hardness compared to the Mohs hardness scale.\nThe Mohs hardness scale is based on ten minerals of different hardness, divided into ten levels from low to high: 1. Talc; 2. Gypsum; 3. Calcite; 4. Fluorite; 5. Apatite; 6. Orthoclase; 7. Quartz; 8. Topaz; 9. Corundum; 10. Diamond.\nIn use, standard minerals are scratched against minerals of unknown hardness. If the mineral can be scratched by apatite but not by fluorite, its hardness is determined to be between 4 and 5.\nThis method was established and named by German mineralogy professor Friedrich Mohs (1773-1839). However, accurate measurement of mineral hardness still requires a microhardness tester or hardness tester. Mineral hardness is also one of the physical properties of minerals. Minerals with high hardness have been widely used in industrial technology.\nDiamonds, corundum, and other minerals are not only used in industry, but also become precious gemstones. As gemstones, they usually have a high hardness.\nFor example, the hardness of opal is 5.5-6.5, quartz is 6.5-7, sphalerite is 7.5-8. Tsavorite is 8.5, and the hardness of sapphires and rubies is 9, second only to diamonds. People choose high-hardness minerals as gemstones, probably because they are wear-resistant, symbolizing their timeless value!\nAccording to needs, people have also developed a gem hardness scale to identify the mineral hardness of gemstones, from the softest to the hardest minerals: talc, gypsum, calcite, fluorite, apatite, zircon, corundum, silicon carbide, boron carbide, diamond, etc.\nWhen there is no standard hardness mineral, the simplest way to measure hardness is with a fingernail or a small knife. The hardness of a fingernail is 2.5, a copper coin is 3, and glass and a small knife are both 5. Those above 6 are almost all gemstone-like minerals."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"code-switched"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:22f52520-a5e9-4460-b963-ec433be6194f>","<urn:uuid:6f5dff6d-ddef-43d0-937c-cbff7f05f328>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do the monitoring capabilities compare between a piezoshaker system with Shearography/ESPI and the QSC TouchMix-16's wireless control system?","answer":"The piezoshaker system uses Shearography/ESPI systems to monitor full field vibration and lamb waves transmitted to test objects, allowing observation of natural object vibrations and subsurface defects. The QSC TouchMix-16, on the other hand, offers wireless monitoring through an iOS app that allows remote control via WiFi, enabling users to control mixer parameters and monitor audio settings from anywhere in the room using an iPad, with additional monitoring features like real-time analyzer (RTA) and Anti-Feedback Wizard.","context":["The piezoshaker excitation systems are designed for vibration measurement and non destructive testing and consist of a piezoshaker, an amplifier and a function generator. Optionally, the waves of the piezoshaker, transmitted to the test object, can be monitored by isi-sys Shearography / ESPI systems. Our Shearography / ESPI systems enable to monitor full field vibration such as e. g. the natural object vibrations. The video on the right shows the lamb waves, generated by the piezoshaker, that is attached at the bottom of the specimen. The waves travel across the object surface and excite the five local subsurface defects on the top. The local defects vibrate differently, depending on their local mechanical properties (stiffness). Only very little power of the piezoshaker is required, when the excitation frequency is close to the local defect resonance frequency. This principle is used in non-destructive testing for example, especially to locate delaminations in sandwich structures. Here, usually the piezoshakers of the PS-X-03 series with vacuum adapter are used.\nPS-X-03 Series with Suction Cup adapter\nThe PS-X-03-Series is designed for non destructive testing purpose in combination with ESPI/Shearography. It is fixed on the object surface by vacuum via a suction cup. The pressing force is adjustable by the vacuum level. Different actuator types are available for different frequency range and forces in combination with different counterweight mass.\nPS-L-02-Series with mounting table and forced cooling\nThe PS-L-02 Series is designed for vibrating of small objects such as electronic devices at high frequencies. The adapter table is exchangeable and can be customized with threads for object mounting (M4). Mounting of load cell for force measurement is optional. Mass of gravity of the object should be near center. For continuous operation at high loads and frequencies forced air cooling is required. A DC centrifugal fan is included, which can be connected to the amplifier for powering. It is available with different characteristics (frequency range, amplitudes and forces).\nPS-M-LC-Series with screw mount and load cell adapter\nThe PS-M-LC-Series is designed for screwing or gluing on the object surface and can be combined with load cells. The piezoshaker is available with actuator types for different force and frequency ranges in combination with variation of the housing diameters defending the counterweight mass of the shaker body. A suitable and common load cell is for example the PCB model No. 201B02 (Force Sensor ICP® quartz force ring), which max. Frequency is 90kHz.\nThe amplifier HVDA-0-180 is especially design for isi-sys Piezoshakers and mobile application, where high power at low weight and compact size is a big advantage for mobility and flexible handling. Modular or customized versions for Shearography units including function generator and vacuum pump. High frequencies up to 100kHz and more as well as large forces and acceleration have been generated in combination with the different isi-sys Piezoshaker modules.\nExcitation power, force and acceleration of a piezoshaker system are functions of the frequency, its amplitude and thus also depend on the amplifier output, characterized by its transfer function. You can request the transfer function of the amplifier from isi-sys. The frequency range for application of the piezoshaker is limited depending on its electrical capacity. Adjustment of the excitation power is usually possible via the amplitude and frequency generated by the function generator and can be monitored via the voltage and current monitor-outputs.\nFunction generator / DAQ unit\nDifferent function generators are supported by the Software isi-Studio. It offers to run the requires features for non destructive testing such as automatic frequency sweeping. The standard function generator / DAQ unit also offers to measure current and voltage output of the amplifier. This permits to monitor the power applied to the surface.\nThe Piezoshaker can be attached by vacuum to the object surface. When pressurized air is not available, isi-sys offers small vacuum pump units. Two independent vacuum sources are recommended when also a tripod with suction cups is used. The vacuum level is adjustable via pump speed, which is recommended to prevent damage to the object surface by vacuum forces.","16-channel digital mixer\nOur take on the QSC TouchMix-16 by Crutchfield's Buck Pomerantz\nYou'll get your music sounding right quickly and easily with QSC's TouchMix-16 16-channel digital mixer.

Make sure that phantom power is on for those channels that need it and off for those that don't.\n- Dedicated Talkback Mic Input: The TouchMix-16 also features a dedicated Talkback Mic input.\nNote: Maximum input level of +16 dBu (Mic/Line inputs, XLR), +26 dBu (Mic/Line inputs, TRS), and +22 dBu (Stereo inputs).\nFull Featured Outputs: The QSC TouchMix-16 digital mixer provides 2 main XLR line-level outputs, 6 mono-auxiliary XLR outputs, two stereo auxiliary 1/4\" TRS outputs, one stereo 1/4\" TRS monitor output, and one stereo cue 1/4\" TRS output. The main outputs and aux's 1-6 feature 1/3 octave GEQ, Limiter, 4 full-frequency notch filters plus Variable 18dB/oct Low-cut and High-cut filters. Aux's 7/8 & 9/10 feature 4-band PEQ, Limiter, plus additional variable 18dB/oct Low-cut and High-cut filters. The auxiliary outputs are typically used to drive stage monitor speaker systems or in-ear monitors (IEM) for performers. In some instances they may be used for a recording mix, audio feed to video or a send to an overflow area.\nNote: The two stereo aux outputs, stereo monitor output and stereo cue output can be used for line-level or headphone; 16Ω min. impedance.\n4 Professional Quality Stereo DSP Effects: The QSC TouchMix-16 incorporates 4 professional effects engines including reverb, echo, delay, chorus. There 50 factory, 50 user presets , and 1 pitch correct (assignable to any mono input channel). Audio effects (FX) such as reverb, delay, chorus, pitch shift (pitch change) and pitch correct are essential in today's audio production.\nScene & Preset Memory: 130 user-defined scenes, including all mixer parameters may be stored internally or on FAT32 formatted USB. Also, 130 user-defined channel presets and 130 FX presets may be stored internally or on FAT32 formatted USB.\n- Scenes: A Scene is a group of settings that are saved and can be recalled at a later time. A Scene includes all channel-processing settings, channel Names, Phantom Power settings, Effects selections, DCA and Mute Group assignments. Scenes also include level settings. Factory scenes are stored with input faders at minimum to prevent any surprises when the scene is recalled.\n- Presets: A Channel Preset is a group of settings, for a single channel, that are saved and can be recalled for use at a later time. A Channel Preset includes the channel Name, Phantom power setting, and values for the channel EQ, Compressor, and Gate.\nUSB Recording: The TouchMix-16 is also capable of direct recording to an external USB 3.0 hard drive (FAT32/7800 RPM); no external computer is required. All inputs plus a stereo mix (up to 22 tracks) are created in 32-bit broadcast wave format (48 or 44.1 kHz). Tracks can also be played back on the mixer or imported into most DAW software for over-dubs and post production. The USB recording function offers 2-band shelving EQ, variable 24 dB/octave HPF, gate, and compressor.\nCapacitive Touchscreen: The QSC TouchMix-16 mixer utilizes a color, capacitive touchscreen graphical user interface combined with hardware controls for fast and intuitive operation. Mixer parameters may be adjusted on the screen or via the physical rotary encoder. Frequently used functions can be accessed or controlled using hardware buttons. The TouchMix-16 offers two modes of operation - Simple or Advanced.\n- Simple Mode: Presents the user with a reduced set of controls. It's important to know that switching into Simple mode does not alter the values of any Advanced-mode controls.\n- Advanced Mode: Presents all mixer controls to the user\nTouchMix Control iOS App: TouchMix Control is a free app for iPad, iPad mini, iPhone and iPod touch (running iOS 6.0 or later) that provides wireless control via WiFi (USB/WiFi adapter pre-installed) of the QSC TouchMix series mixer.\n- For iPad & iPad mini: When run on the iPad and iPad mini, the TouchMix Control app closely follows the operational paradigm of the mixers and provides access to all digital mix parameters. In use the iPad and the mixer GUI do not follow each other so it is possible for the iPad to act as an additional user interface that can display and control a set of functions completely different from those being controlled by the mixer's screen and hardware. When used without an actual TouchMix, the app acts as a demonstration of the mixer GUI and functionality but does not control audio in any way\n- For iPhone & iPod touch: On the iPhone and iPod touch, the TouchMix Control app functions as a personal stage monitor mix control with the option to also remotely operate the mixer's record and playback features as well as programmable user buttons. To prevent inadvertent adjustment of controls, the mixer operator may allow or restrict access to functions on a per-device basis.\nCarrying Case: The TouchMix series mixer comes complete with its own padded carrying case, for transport and protection.\nOur Product Research Team\nAt Crutchfield, you'll get detailed, accurate information that's hard to find elsewhere.

{"question":"How does the cleanup process of uranium mines differ between Monument Valley and the Western AUM Region? 🤔","answer":"In Monument Valley, the cleanup process involved EPA demolishing contaminated structures like Elsie's hogan in 2001 and continuing cleanup efforts through 2011. In contrast, in the Western AUM Region, the cleanup process involves multiple legal agreements with companies like El Paso Natural Gas, EnPro Holdings, and Babbitt Ranches to assess over 100 abandoned uranium mines. The Western region's process includes extensive community involvement through chapter meetings, school presentations, and coordination with various organizations like the Navajo Nation Environmental Protection Agency and Indian Health Service.","context":["What happened after we released our award-winning documentary, The Return of Navajo Boy about uranium contamination on native lands? The short answer is, quite a bit. Groundswell Educational Films is releasing a series of webisodes showing the effect that the documentary has had on the lives of its participants, and how the film is still being used today to affect change. You can watch them here in chronological order, and order the film on DVD which contains our epilogue.\nWebisode 15: Navajos Win The Largest Environmental Settlement in History (April 2014)\nInfamous corporate polluter, Kerr-McGee, agreed to settle a federal bankruptcy case by paying the Navajo Nation a billion dollars to help clean up radioactive contamination at 50 abandoned uranium mines. The Return of Navajo Boy includes clips from Kerr-McGee’s own 1950s propaganda film titled, “A Navajo Journey,” which promoted the safety and benefits of uranium mining and featured Elsie Mae Begay and Bernie Cly as children. Director Jeff Spitz found the film and used it to expose Kerr-McGee’s history. The Return of Navajo Boy gives voice to the many courageous people who are advocating for a comprehensive clean up of abandoned uranium mines in Navajo communities. There are more than 520 abandoned uranium mines according to the EPA. After more than half a century “A Navajo Journey” is coming full circle.\nWebisode 14: Cleanup Continues (October 2011)\nThe long-overdue cleanup marches on in Monument Valley.\nWebisode 13: Film Moves Congress & Mountains (June 2011)\nSee the clean up action through Navajo eyes.\nWebisode 12: Environmental Historians Applaud Elsie, Perry and Navajo Boy (May 2011)\n“The Return of Navajo Boy” was screened at the 2011 American Society for Environmental History conference. Navajo nuclear scientist Perry Charley shares his own experiences with uranium and the toll it has taken on his health.\nWebisode 11: Clean Up in Elsie’s Backyard (April 2011)\nA new dispatch from Mary Helen shows that the US EPA’s clean up of Oljato Mesa and the abandoned Skyline Mine has begun, eleven years after the debut of “The Return of Navajo Boy.”\nWebisode 10: Mary Helen Visits Chicago (November 2010)\nMary Helen Begay visited Chicago recently and spoke about her experiences with uranium at a screening of The Return of Navajo Boy.\nWebisode 9: Introducing the Navajo Nation Water Quality Project (December 2010)\nGroundswell partners with Northwestern University Chemistry Department and Navajos to build a website focused on water quality on the Navajo Nation.\nWebisode 8: Reporters Visit (November 2010)\nMary Helen documents the visit of reporters from Salt Lake City. They’re interested to learn the status of the cleanup.\nWebisode 7: A Navajo Report from Elsie’s Backyard (May 2010)\nWe gave Mary Helen Begay (Elsie’s daughter in law) a flip video camera to document the uranium cleanup on Navajo Nation. Here’s her first on the ground report with an EPA contractor.\nWebisode 6: It’s not just Elsie’s Backyard (March, 2010)\nAfter watching Navajo Boy Webisodes, Paul Robinson of the Southwest Uranium Research and Information Center (www.sric.org) relates Elsie’s story to the rest of Navajo Nation. Paul is from the Southwest Research and Information Center and focuses on Uranium mining contamination in the Church Rock and Window Rock area among other issues.\nWebisode 5: Mary and Lorenzo sell “The Return of Navajo Boy” DVDs in their Monument Valley gift shop (March, 2010)\nLorenzo Begay (the narrator of “The Return of Navajo Boy”) and his wife, Mary, have a gift shop in Monument Valley. In this video, Mary can be seen selling DVDs to tourists.\nWebisode 4: Screening the film on the Navajo Nation reservation (March, 2010)\nIn March 2010, Groundswell Educational Films screened the film at Rough Rock Trading Post on the reservation to raise awareness about the health effects of local uranium contamination. In attendance were director Jeff Spitz and Elsie Mae Cly Begay, along with Perry H. Charley, Director of the Uranium Education Program at Diné College, who answered questions from the audience.\nWebisode 3: Elsie and the documentary head to Washington, DC (September, 2008)\nIn September 2008, Groundswell brought Elsie and the film’s new epilogue to Capitol Hill for a screening and discussion about hazardous waste cleanup with EPA officials and congressional staffers.\nWebisode 2: Elsie’s home is demolished by the EPA (May, 2001)\nAbout a year after their initial investigation, the EPA demolished Elsie’s highly-contaminated hogan. EPA consultant Andrew Sowder is seen at the end of this clip suggesting that the agency should construct fencing or a sign around the area to protect local residents from further contamination.\nWebisode 1: The EPA inspects Elsie’s home (January, 2000)\nThe story of Elsie Mae Begay is featured prominently in our documentary; her home was partially constructed out of uranium rocks from an abandoned mine nearby. Around the same time our film was making its premiere, the EPA investigated her home to see how dangerous it might be. The following is from an official EPA videotape of the investigation, obtained by Groundswell through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA).","Western Abandoned Uranium Mine Region\nThere are more than 100 abandoned uranium mines (AUMs) in the Western AUM Region. These mines are generally located along the Little Colorado River and Highway 89, and are in the Cameron, Coalmine Canyon, Bodaway/Gap, and Leupp Chapters.\nMines in the Western AUM Region were operated in the 1950s and 1960s by a number of different companies before being abandoned. While the Navajo Nation Abandoned Mine Lands program addressed many of the physical hazards associated with these mines, EPA and Navajo Nation EPA are working to address remaining chemical and radiological hazards that may pose a risk to community members.\n- Legal Agreements and Upcoming Mine Assessments\nEPA, in partnership with Navajo Nation EPA, is working to identify companies responsible for the mines and to oversee detailed assessments of the mines. In the Western AUM Region, several agreements have been completed allowing for mine assessments:\n- In 2013, EPA signed a legal agreement called an Administrative Order on Consent with El Paso Natural Gas to assess 19 mine claims in western Navajo Nation. In 2017, EPA issued a modification to the Administrative Order on Consent to continue work at the 19 mines.\n- In 2015, the Phase 1 Navajo Environmental Response Trust was established, which included funding for the assessment of one mine claim in the area.\n- In 2016, EPA signed a legal agreement with Babbitt Ranches to assess the Section 9 Lease Abandoned Uranium Mine site.\n- Also in 2016, the Phase 2 Navajo Environmental Response Trust was established, which included funding for the assessment of 13 mine claims in the area.\n- In 2017, EPA signed a legal agreement with EnPro Holdings to assess eight AUMs, including two priority mines.\nThese assessments will allow EPA, working with Navajo Nation EPA, to develop clean up options for the mines. EPA will continue to involve the community during mine assessments and as we begin to consider cleanup options.\nIn the communities of Cameron, Coalmine Canyon, Bodaway/Gap, and Leupp, residents should know and participate in what EPA is doing in their community, and have a say in it. The main purpose of engaging community members is to give them the opportunity to become involved in EPA’s activities and help shape the decisions that are made affecting their community.\nTo further this goal, EPA developed the Western Navajo Abandoned Uranium Mine Region Community Involvement Plan with input from community members. The Community Involvement Plan is a living document to guide community members and EPA in meaningful information sharing regarding cleanup activities in the Western Abandoned Uranium Mine Region.\n- Who Is the Community?\nMines in the area are located along the Little Colorado River and Highway 89, and are located in the Cameron, Coalmine Canyon, Bodaway/Gap, and Leupp Chapters. Some of the mines are located near Homesites, especially those who live near the bridge in Cameron over the Little Colorado River. Additional mines are located along the Little Colorado River south of Cameron and along Highway 89 north of Cameron. Affected community members include those who graze livestock in these areas or have vending stalls along the highway.\n- Current Community Involvement Activities\nEPA works with Chapter Officials as well as community members for all outreach activities and information sessions which are conducted with cultural sensitivity. EPA continues to:\n- Report at Chapter meetings and District 3 Grazing meetings\n- Report at Community Land Use Planning Committee meetings\n- Present at EPA-led meetings in the community\n- Attend special events such as the Western Nation Fair and Cameron Community Celebration\n- Present at schools such as Dzil Libei Elementary School\n- Produce factsheets relevant to the Superfund cleanup process and upcoming work in the region\n- Inform residents door-to-door when work will be taking place near their Homesite\n- Meet with Chapter officials and Navajo Nation Council Delegates\n- Past Community Involvement Activities\nEPA completed the following activities in the community:\n- Reported at numerous Cameron, Coalmine Canyon, and Bodaway/Gap Chapter meetings\n- Reported at numerous District 3 Grazing meetings\n- Reported at Cameron, Coalmine Canyon, and Bodaway/Gap Community Land Use Planning meetings\n- Conducted Community Involvement Plan interviews in Cameron, Coalmine Canyon, and Bodaway/Gap\n- Met with Chapter officials and Council Delegates\n- Presented on warning signs and upcoming field work at the Cameron Senior Center and the Cameron community building\n- Participated in Bennett Freeze tours with the Navajo Nation Office of the President and Vice President, Navajo Nation, Council Members, Arizona State Legislature Members, and staffers of US Congressional Representatives\n- Set up information booths at the Western Nation Fair in Tuba City, the Cameron Community Celebration, and the Community Uranium Exposure-Journey to Healing Mobile Clinic in Cameron\n- Presented at Dzil Libei Elementary School in 2014, 2015, and 2016\nEPA continues to work and strengthen relationship with a number of organizations focused on uranium and radiation, including:\n- Navajo Nation Environmental Protection Agency\n- Navajo Nation Abandoned Mine Lands Program\n- Navajo Environmental Response Trust\n- Indian Health Service Community Uranium Exposure-Journey to Healing\n- Indian Health Service Radiation Exposure Screening and Education Program\n- Office of Navajo Uranium Workers\n- Navajo Birth Cohort Study\n- Navajo Nation Department of Health Community Health Representatives\n- Bureau of Indian Affairs\n- Indian Health Service\n- Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry\n- Nuclear Regulatory Commission\n- Department of Energy\n- University of New Mexico\n- Northern Arizona University\n- Forgotten People Community Development Corporation\n- Coconino County Board of Supervisors\n- Others as suggested by community members and local officials\nEnPro Holdings Inc.

{"question":"What types of licenses exist for amateur radio operators, and how were different operator roles utilized during the emergency communications exercise?","answer":"There are three types of amateur radio license classes: Technician (entry-level), General (grants operating privileges on all bands and modes), and Amateur Extra (conveys all available operating privileges). During the November 21st drill, operators with various licenses performed different roles, including Central Dispatch (KB2HRB Tony), Emergency Coordinator (W2OFD Joe), patrol units (like W2ALW, KE2YK Gary, and others), and SKYWARN spotter (KC2COL Bill). These operators coordinated communications for multiple emergency scenarios, demonstrating the practical application of their licensing privileges.","context":["RICHMOND, Va. — Members of the Virginia Defense Force took part in the “Perfect Storm” statewide amateur radio emergency communications exercise Jan. 19, 2019, in Richmond and Lynchburg, Virginia, and the VDF was among the nearly 80 amateur operators and agencies registered for this annual event. In Richmond, VDF personnel trained on amateur radio systems and built partnerships with amateur radio operators who support the Virginia Department of Emergency Management at the Virginia Emergency Operations Center. In Lynchburg, VDF members used the equipment in their mobile communications platform trailer to make contact the operators across the state.\n“Our goal for exercise was to test communications across the state using different modes, methods and procedures working with multiple amateur radio groups from Southwest Virginia to Virginia Beach and up into Warren County,” said Chris Bruce, a VDEM regional all-hazards emergency planner and the coordinator for VDEM amateur radio program as a volunteer. “We are working with the Virginia Defense Force to improve capabilities and personnel and experience in the radio room.”\nAmateur radio can be an invaluable emergency communications resource in severe weather situations when tradition systems are unavailable. Bruce explained.\nThe exercise provided an opportunity for the VDF to continue to build on the existing partnership with VDEM and expand their relationships with amateur radio organizations, said Maj. (Va.) Shawn P. Landis, a Communications Operations Officer for the VDF and was the officer in charge of the VDF personnel working in Richmond during the exercise.\nLandis explained that each time the VDF is able to conduct exercises with amateur radio organizations, they are able to improve their ability to communicate across long distances. He added that the exercises provide opportunities for experimentation with different antenna configurations, different modes operation, and to learn from amateur radio operators with many years of experience. For this exercise, several modes of operation were available for use, but HF and Telnet Winlink (digital message transmission), and HF 40 and 80 meters voice communications were used by the operators at VDEM.\n“These exercises provide an assessment of capabilities in terms of training and equipment, and we get better each time we come out,” he said.\nAccording to the National Association of Amateur Radio web site, there are three types of license classes for amateur radio operations: Technician, General and Amateur Extra. The Technician class license is the entry-level license of choice for most new radio operators, the General class license grants some operating privileges on all amateur radio bands and all operating modes, and the Amateur Extra class license conveys all available U.S. Amateur Radio operating privileges on all bands and all modes.\nThe ARRL site explains that amateur radio, also known as ham radio, can be used to talk across town, around the world, or even into space, all without the Internet or cell phones and can “be a lifeline during times of need.” Amateur radio operates on designated “radio bands” as authorized by the FCC as a companion to other bands of radio spectrum allocated for government, military and commercial radio uses employed by aircraft, ship, fire and police communications.\nLandis holds the Amateur General license, and the VDF currently has about 10 percent of its members holding one of the three licenses. The highest percentage of members with licenses are assigned to the Communications Battalion, but the VDF is encouraging all its members to pursue this achievement. Members who have a license can were a tab on their uniform indicating the type of amateur license they hold. Membership in the VDF helps license holders to improve their skills and help them prepare for the higher level license.\nTo earn the Technician license requires passing one examination totaling 35 questions on radio theory, regulations and operating practices. After earning the Technician license, an operator can earn the General class license rafter passing passing a 35 question examination. Earning the Amateur Extra license requires passing a thorough 50 question examination.\nThe VDF MCP is a 7 1/2 feet by 16 feet trailer equipped with multiple radio systems for voice and data communications, and it also features a map board and work space so it can function as a mobile command post. Using an MCP, members of the VDF are able to communicate across a variety of radio spectrums with emergency response and public safety organizations as well as amateur radio operators.\nThe VDF is authorized by Title 44 of the Code of the Virginia as the all-volunteer reserve of the Virginia National Guard, and it serves as a force multiplier integrated into all Guard domestic operations. The VDF reports to the Adjutant General of Virginia as part of the Virginia Department of Military Affairs along with the Virginia Army National Guard and Virginia Air National Guard. Members of the VDF volunteer their time for training and are only paid when called to state active duty by an authorization from the Governor of Virginia.\nDuring domestic operations, the Virginia National Guard receives missions through the Virginia Department of Emergency Management to assist the Virginia State Police and other state and local emergency service organizations as part of the state emergency response team.","The Amateur Radio Communications Team staged a multi-faceted drill on November 21st.

{"question":"How do foreign versus local ownership structures impact the sustainability of tourism operations, and what are the recommended practices for hotels to ensure both environmental and community benefits?","answer":"Foreign ownership in tourism operations can be detrimental as it often leads to economic leakage, where profits leave the destination country and return to the country of ownership. This commonly occurs with resort properties and chain hotels, where not only room profits but also hotel accessories, amenities, and food are imported, preventing local producers from benefiting from the tourism industry. To ensure both environmental and community benefits, hotels should implement sustainable practices such as using local products instead of mass-produced souvenirs, highlighting local farm-to-table restaurants, and working with local businesses. Additionally, hotels should focus on environmental initiatives like efficient lighting, water conservation, and waste reduction while ensuring local communities can participate in and profit from tourism development through employment and business opportunities.","context":["INTERNATIONAL REPORT—In Booking.com’s most recent “Sustainable Travel Report,” 87% of travelers said that they want to travel sustainably.\n“From our research, we found nearly three-fifths of travelers said natural sites that they have visited in the past were the inspiration to travel more sustainably, seeing the visible impact that tourism can have on places,” said Todd Dunlap, managing director, Americas, Booking.com. “In the past, we’ve seen the backlash on social media when trails get overrun, beaches become littered, and natural wonders become desecrated, so I think travelers are trying to be more conscious of their effect on the environment and being able to make these places accessible for years to come for future generations.”\nNearly half of the travelers in the survey defined sustainable travel as eco-friendly or green accommodations. This is why it is important for hotels to have sustainable practices, and to let their guests—and potential guests—know the actions they are taking.\nWhile many hotels have programs for guests to reuse their towels and have changed to refillable pumps in bathrooms instead of small, limited-use plastic bottles, other less-obvious changes can make a difference. “Hotels can work not only via their social channels to highlight their sustainable initiatives, but with local businesses, too,” he said. “For example, using an area of the lobby to curate locally made products instead of mass-produced plastic souvenirs, or highlighting local restaurants with farm-to-table initiatives.”\nHotels need to meet the sustainability desires of guests. “Our colleagues and guests—and our business at large—all depend on a healthy, stable planet in order to thrive,” said Marié Fukudome, director of environmental affairs and corporate responsibility, Hyatt Hotels Corp. “We have comprehensive global environmental sustainability goals, many of which are aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Our 2020 sustainability vision includes goals for reducing energy, water use and carbon emissions at hotels, increasing waste diversion and sustainable purchasing, and building efficient hotels.”\nSome of Hyatt’s property-specific initiatives include upgrading to efficient lighting and fixtures, installing on-site solar panels, using recycled water for landscaping, growing rooftop gardens, and composting food scraps. “Most recently, Hyatt hotels around the world eliminated plastic straws, furthering our global efforts to reduce environmental impact,” she said.\nFor the last 10 years, Hyatt has also collaborated with Clean the World, a nonprofit that collects used soap and shampoo products from hotels, recycles them and then donates them to communities in need.\nIndividual properties can also help with sustainability with the suggestions made to guests for activities during their stay. “Concierges can make sure to suggest less busy or popular tourist sites, and encourage and instruct guests on how to use public transit instead of taxis,” said Dunlap. “These types of travelers tend to come with an engaged fan base that spreads the word on traveling sustainably.”\nHotels across the globe have also let guests know of their sustainability efforts by becoming recognized by various independent certification agencies. Booking.com has worked with one of these organizations—Green Key, an internationally recognized eco-label with strict award criteria that honors positive environmental management.\nThe Green Key program is a voluntary eco-label for hotels and other tourism facilities based on compliance with a strict set of criteria dealing with environmental management, CSR and environmental information and training. The program has a strict on-site audit frequency, and the annual award is always third-party verified. More than 3,000 properties in 57 countries have received the eco-label.\n“Guests are more sensitive to sustainability issues than before,” said Finn Bolding Thomsen, international Green Key director. “The threat from climate change is increasingly evident to everyone, and it has become much higher on the agenda in the world. With an eco-label like Green Key, guests have realized that they can book accommodations with good environmental and sustainability standards, while still being in the desired location and without much higher price.”\nFukudome said that it is not only individual guests who are interested in sustainability initiatives. “Hyatt’s corporate clients are particularly interested in our environmental efforts, and we receive RFP questions from many clients asking about our sustainability commitments, carbon emissions and energy and water use,” she said. “Many of these companies have their own sustainability goals for their operations and their supply chain. As a company that supports events and business travel, it’s important for Hyatt to demonstrate our responsible practices.”\nBooking.com has also done its part to encourage sustainable travel. “We work with NGOs, institutes, and social enterprises, as well as support sustainable tourism changemakers with our accelerator program and, in 2018, offered more than $2 million in grants to help fund sustainable tourism,” said Dunlap. “Our Booking Booster Program also plays an active role in this area, identifying, empowering and providing funding for start-ups that help relieve pressure on overcrowded tourist areas; businesses that positively impact the environment; and social ventures that are supporting local communities in the tourism industry.” HB","In sports, you're only as strong as your weakest player. Similarly, when it comes to ecotourism, a destination is only as sustainable as its least eco-friendly attraction. The attractions, accommodation, services, and infrastructure are all integral components to the overall sustainability of a destination, therefore the eco-success of a destination depends on the sustainability of its parts. For those conscious travelers seeking an holistic experience of sustainability, there are a few key elements to be considered when evaluating the overall sustainability and ecotourism potential of a destination.\nAccording to the definition and principles of ecotourism established by The International Ecotourism Society (TIES) in 1990, ecotourism definition is \"Responsible travel to natural areas that conserves the environment and improves the well-being of local people.\"\nAs such, when considering how to conduct sustainable development and participate in ecotourism, it is crucial to consider all aspects of this definition: economic, social, and environmental impacts. Following this, these are some ways to consider the elements of ecotourism on your next adventure.\nA destination's care and concern for the protection of its natural environment is integral to the destination's sustainable and ecotourims practices success. Often considered a cornerstone of sustainability, along with socio-cultural and economic factors, the environment is so easily impacted by human activity, especially due to high levels of tourist behavior. Environmental concerns will be touched upon in most of the following sub-headings, and it is important to understand that a destination's sustainability can be defined by its commitment to environmental protection. The environment, however, is not the only mark of a sustainable and ecotourism destination, as will be discussed further below.\nLocal vs. Foreign Ownership\nForeign capital investment is, often times, an integral component of development when it comes to the tourism industry, as are foreign business consultants. However, foreign ownership of properties, attractions, transportation, and services can be one of the most detrimental forces working against local communities seeking to benefit from tourism. Often times foreign ownership causes economic leakage, which is when profits 'leak' out of the destination and back to the country of ownership. This typically happens with resort properties and chain hotels, common destinations for tourists, so it is important for ecotourism travelers to understand the full impacts of their spending. Not only do profits from the rooms go to benefit foreign entities, it is also very common for hotel accessories, amenities, food, and other products to be imported into the destination from the source country, meaning local farmers and producers have no opportunity to provide their produce to hotels. This barrier between the locals and tourism industry is unfair and unsustainable, since it does not allow the local population to profit and benefit from a consumptive industry operating in their backyard. When the local population is involved in the process, they are able to contribute to a ecotourism industry that is positively facilitating opportunities for local development through responsible tourism.\nLocal Communities and Tourism Development\nThe cornerstone of sustainable tourism is that it is able to enrich a promising future, economically, environmentally, and socially, for the local community. Often times we focus on environmental impacts, and economic forces, and forget that the social concerns are just as important.\nWe’ve talked about buying local, but it goes further than that. Not only is it important to support the local economies, it is important to enrich local societies by involving the communities in the tourism industry.\nIt is also vital to understand the detrimental impact tourism can have on communities. There are a number of different ways tourism can actually cause human-rights violations in destinations, and in some cases, locals can be exploited for the benefit of tourists. This exploitation commonly occurs through the exploitation of women and children, as well as cultural conflicts and poor working conditions in the tourism industry.\nHowever, in the face of enormous challenges and depravity, there are bright lights in the future of local communities and tourism. There are community-based initiatives around the world that seek to enrich the lives of locals and tourists alike by promoting local accommodation and tour ownership and positive tourist behaviours. Many communities are benefitting from these types of efforts, and provided education, awareness, and initiatives continue, more local communities will be able to successfully implement community-based tourism.\nIt is so critical to understand the role local communities play in tourism development, in that it must be of a sustainable nature for the community to truly benefit. Employing initiatives that are run and managed by locals, using local man-power, material, and resources is crucial, otherwise tourism has the potential to ravage, exploit, and destroy a community’s resources, people, and dignity.\nGovernment-Initiated Responsible Tourism and Ecotourism Strategy\nIn recent years, many governments have developed ecotourism or sustainable tourism strategies. While many ecotourism strategies are well crafted and use a balanced approach of focusing on appropriate areas, many responsible tourism strategies contain problems that are seen throughout the world.\nWhile oftentimes the overall intention of the strategy is well meaning, many responsible tourism strategies possess glaring faults, predominately in the form of excessively ambitious lists of priorities, political interference, economic misguidance, and lack of attention to socio-cultural enrichment. Often ecotourism strategies lack focus, and fail to address the cornerstones of sustainable tourism development - environment, socio-cultural, and economic. The fourth cornerstone, politics, when not promoting sustainability, has the nasty habit of getting in the way of it. Can't help itself.\nThere are, however, some very successful responsible tourism strategies. These typically incorporate the strategy into a government-wide vision of responsible and sustainable initiatives, and these strategies are fundamental assets in achieving holistic sustainable development.\nEcotourism Practices for accommodation\nAs mentioned earlier, hotels possibly have the most negative impact on the sustainability of destinations, and they really needn't. Hotels can be guilty of any number of offenses, including foreign ownership and thus economic leakage through imports, exclusion of the local population, exploitation of the local population through poor working conditions, strain on the environment due to water consumption, disregard for building codes with structural and environmental ramifications, and segregation of tourists and locals. Bad nuts, eh? Many tourists (and this is perhaps where we see the greatest distinction between 'travelers' and tourists') are completely or partially unaware of these issues, and unfortunately, quite a few don't particularly care and choose to be blissfully ignorant.\nHowever, if you're a keen traveler with an interest in sleeping ethically in an ecotourism destination, there are accommodations throughout the world that focus on low or zero emissions, and keep a close eye on their carbon footprint. There are green-focused hostels, eco-lodges, boutique hotels, and luxury ecotourism accommodations around the world that are committed to sustainable tourism and achieving zero carbon emissions. A word to the wise, though - some hotel groups that are focused on zero emissions and low carbon footprints may not have local ownership (or opportunities for locals to profit and benefit from the industry), so be wary of the terminology used. Usually your best option is a certified eco-lodge, but if there isn’t one in your destination, use your knowledge and discretion to make the best decision.\nYou can also impact how sustainable your accommodation experience is by following ecotourism guidelines about water-saving efforts such as re-using your towels, saving water while brushing your teeth, and showering efficiently. Also remembering to turn off your lights, TV, and air conditioning when not using the room can help reduce your impact, so even if you aren't able to find an eco-lodge or certified green room to sleep in, you can still make personal adjustments to yield a more sustainable experience.\nEcotourism Attraction Policies and Procedures\nOkay, so you've found your eco-lodge (or at least left your hotel room with the lights off), and you want to go exploring. How do you know that your attractions are following the right ecotourism policies and procedures when it comes to sustainability? As previously discussed, if a destination is to achieve holistic sustainability, its attractions, as well as its other tourism components, need to be green. For instance, snorkeling or scuba diving outfitters should ensure they're operating responsibly with regards to number of tour participants, rules and regulations for participants under water, etc. Ecotourism hiking trails should ideally have guide pamphlets available and information on where and how to dispose of trash.\nSome ecotourism destinations around the world have the right attitude towards greening their tourism and local attractions. They often provide visitors with comprehensive guides to sustainable attractions and ecotourism in their region, and typically point visitors towards attractions that are committed to environmental awareness, or ones that are car-free. Many of these destinations have some type of green business scheme, which usually acts as encouragement for tourism businesses to carry sustainable attitudes and ecotourism initiatives into the future. While these programs are met with mixed levels of success, this is the type of thing that contributes to the overall sustainability of a destination.\nTransportation in ecotourism\nTransportation can be really difficult in-destination, especially if the necessary infrastructure doesn't exist (it usually doesn't). Obviously the easiest way to compensate for your ecotourism transportation to the destination would be to off-set your air travel, (less expensive than you think), or to consider carbon-neutral methods of transportation, like walking, using eco-friendly cabs, public transit, or some trains.\nOnce you're in the destination, the challenge begins. In developing nations, traveling by car can appear to be ridiculously bad for the environment, since almost all of their aging car models spew out the worst-looking emissions that simply wouldn't pass in developed nations with emission testing programs. Same thing could be said with boats and trains, to a certain extent. However, some developing nations that traditionally rely on bicycles and other man-powered forms of transportation are beginning to excel at eco-friendly transportation development in other areas of their infrastructure. With green buses on the roads as well as bicycle taxis, some developing nations are quite advanced in terms of greening their transportation and imporve their ecotourism initiatives.\nHowever, using transportation in a sustainable manner does not always have to focus on the environment, although it usually does, it can also include using local companies for hired drivers, boat tours, canoe/kayak rentals, or similar. So long as you ensure your safety is not compromised, having these options at hand can help make a destination more sustainable, and help you better engage in responsible tourism.\nMaking Ecotourim Decisions\nThe paradigm of a wholly sustainable and ecotourism destination is the presence of all of these elements, however a good balance of the elements still indicates a destination and development entities that are focused on holistic and long-term sustainability. It is unlikely that the paradigm often exists, but many destinations are focused on making changes and progressing towards sustainable development, so it's not all doom and gloom.\nIf sustainable travel is truly important to you and your fellow travelers, take the time to research your destination before you start planning. There are a number of comprehensive ecotourism websites, like MyNatour, that are dedicated to eco-friendly and sustainable tourism, as well as advice on making ethical travel decisions.\nOther ecotourism tips\nAnother way to improve the sustainability of the ecotourims industry is to make every effort to 'buy local' while away. From the obvious don't-eat-at-McDonald's (but really, why would you?) to visiting farmers markets for a fruit snack or seeking out local tour operators for your kayak trip, there are ways you can ensure the currency you spend stays in-destination. Think about it - there's a chance that the less demand tourists place on foreign imports, the less goods will be imported.\nThe most sustainable travelers tend to be the most proactive and knowledgeable travelers. There's no shortage of information or ways to make your traveling more sustainable or ethical, and it is absolutely all of our responsibilities, as global citizens and wanderers, to ensure that we understand how to evaluate the sustainability of our destinations, and what we can do to travel responsibly and ethically with the information and resources we have."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"detailed"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"cross-lingual-multisentence"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ef0cbf53-a31f-4a50-a19b-028f0e76d165>","<urn:uuid:1bd7dab1-7f47-433e-bb9e-1126e71f3d48>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the key difference in sunlight exposure requirements between germinating chili seeds vs hardening off young seedlings - can they both handle direct sun right away?","answer":"No, they have different sunlight requirements. Chili seeds need warmth (23-30°C) but not direct sunlight to germinate initially. In contrast, when hardening off young seedlings, they need gradual exposure to sunlight - starting with 30-60 minutes of filtered sunlight per day and slowly increasing exposure time. Direct sunlight too early can damage seedlings that haven't been properly hardened off, even if they're labeled as 'full sun' plants.","context":["Growing chilies from seed is very easy and fun. Allow the chili seeds to germinate in a consistently warm place and use a light compost to make the seeds germinate quickly. Carefully transfer the saplings to small pots, keep them warm, and water regularly. Move the plant to a larger pot as it grows, or plant it in the garden if the weather conditions are warm enough. Pick chili peppers from the plant regularly to add flavor to your dishes!\nMethod 1 of 3: Making Sprouts from Chili Seeds\nStep 1. Place the chili seeds between two damp paper towels\nWet two sheets of paper towels. Spread the chili seeds on one of the paper towels and cover with the second strand on top. Place the seeds in a zip lock bag or plastic container and seal tightly.\nStep 2. Store the seeds in a warm place for 2-5 days\nAs a general rule, chili seeds need a temperature of around 23-30 °C in order to germinate. Put it in a place that is always warm (eg on a heating mat) for 2-5 days until it swells and sprouts. Make sure the heat source is not too intense so that it doesn't melt the zip lock bag or plastic container where the seeds are.\n- Pre-germination treatment before the seeds are planted in compost or in soil like this will give chili peppers greater growth opportunities.\n- In warm climates, chili seeds can be placed outdoors to germinate, as long as the temperature does not drop below 15 °C.\nStep 3. Prepare the seed tray\nFill large seed trays or those with small cell boxes with compost or light ready-to-plant soil to the brim. Break up large lumps. Press compost 1-2 millimeters deep and water.\nThe soil should be watered just before the seeds are planted. After that, water just a little until the seeds germinate\nStep 4. Spread and cover the chili seeds\nPlace the seeds one at a time on top of the compost, 5 cm apart. Cover it lightly with compost. Gently compress the compost and lightly spray it with water in the bottle.\nStep 5. Cover the chili seeds and let them germinate\nPlace a plastic cover over the seedling tray to retain heat and moisture. Place the tray in the same warm place as before. Alternatively, you can purchase an electric germination mat or tray (available at garden supply stores) to help keep the seeds at a consistent warm temperature.\nStep 6. Keep an eye on the seeds\nObserve the seed tray to monitor growth and ensure compost quality. The compost should be damp, but not muddy, and shouldn't be watered unless it feels completely dry. Seeds will begin to germinate after about two weeks.\nMethod 2 of 3: Transferring Chilli Saplings to a Pot\nStep 1. Remove the tillers from the tray\nOnce the saplings reach a height of about 5 cm and have 5-6 leaves, move them to a larger area so they don't overcrowd the roots. Carefully remove the tillers from the tray. Do not disturb the roots.\nWater the chili seedlings before moving so that the compost does not fall out\nStep 2. Plant each sapling in a separate pot\nPrepare a pot with a diameter of approximately 10 cm and fill it with compost. Water the compost a little and make a hole right in the middle. Carefully insert the saplings into the empty hole and bury the surroundings with compost.\n- If you live in a colder climate, plant chili seedlings in pots and place them indoors. Install a grow-light and place it in a warm room.\n- Chili plants can be moved from pots to the garden if the weather and soil are warm enough.\nStep 3. Change the pot to a larger size as needed\nAs the chili plant continues to grow, transfer it to a larger pot. Get a bigger pot and fill it with compost, then make a hole in the middle. Carefully dig the peppers out of the old pot and allow the compost to stick together to protect the root tissue. Put the plant in a larger pot.\n- If you want to keep the chilies small, just plant them in small pots to prevent them from growing.\n- Changes in pot size generally start from 10 cm in diameter to 15 cm, then 20 cm.\nStep 4. Make sure the plant gets enough warmth and light\nPlace the chili pot near a window or outdoors to get some sun. Bring the plant in if the outdoor temperature drops. The amount of light that plants get will directly affect the speed and size of their growth.\nIf the plant is indoors and isn't getting enough natural sunlight, purchase a greenhouse lamp or a small artificial light source (available online or at garden supply stores)\nMethod 3 of 3: Transferring Chili Plants to the Garden\nStep 1. Plant the chilies\nFind a bright spot in the garden that gets at least 6-8 hours of sunlight. Dig a hole large enough to hold a sapling or chili plant. Use a garden fork to dig up some of the soil at the bottom of the hole and add a handful of compost into it. Carefully plant the chilies into the hole and fill the empty space around them with an even mixture of soil and compost.\nKeep a distance of at least 45 cm from other plants to ensure the chili has enough room to grow\nStep 2. Water and fertilize the plant regularly\nIn warm, hot climates, water the chilies daily to keep them hydrated. Don't over-water. Make sure the soil is moist, but not muddy. Fertilize the plant with an all-purpose liquid fertilizer (available at plant stores) every two weeks.\nStep 3. Keep the plant warm\nChili plants should only be moved outdoors in warm climates or places with very long summers. For areas with long summers, it is best to move the chilies outside in June. Purchase a protective hood or dome (a plant cover stuck to the ground around it) to protect the plant from cold weather.\n- Pick chilies as often as possible so that the plant continues to grow fruit and the fruit weight does not decrease.\n- When the plant begins to droop, set it straight so it doesn't fall.\n- Before being transferred to the garden, get used to chili plants with outdoor conditions first. The trick, take it out for a few hours a day, for 2 weeks.","Can I put seedlings in direct sunlight? Initially place seedlings outdoors in a sheltered spot – protected from wind and direct sun. Each day following, expose plants to another 30-60 minutes of filtered sunlight. By the end of the hardening-off time frame, seedlings should be experiencing the same amount of sunlight they’ll receive in the garden.\nWhen should you expose seedlings to direct sunlight? When they have grown their second or third set of serrated leaves (after the the round cotyledons that initially emerge from the seed) seedlings are usually hardy enough to flourish in direct sunlight. Seedlings can be kept by a sunny window, until they’re ready to grow outside.\nCan seedlings get too much sun? Usually we harden off young plants to the cold, but you should also take care not to burn a seedling that has grown in a greenhouse, never exposed to the sun’s full fury. Even “full sun” plants get sunburn if they are not used to the sunshine. Use plenty of water and compost and “mud” your seedlings in the soil.\nShould you put seedlings in the sun? A sunny windowsill is a good place to put sprouted seedlings. Lightly brushing the seedlings encourages the growth of strong stems. Most seeds will not germinate without sunlight and will perform best with 12 to 16 hours each day.\nCan I put seedlings in direct sunlight? – Related Questions\nCan wilted seedlings be revived?\nMove the wilted plant out of the sun, if possible. Set wilted container plants with dry soil in a sink or tray filled with water. Spray the plant’s foliage with water; misting can help rejuvenate the plant quickly. Provide protection from strong sun and heavy wind while the plant recovers.\nCan seedlings get too much light?\nTo put it bluntly, yes, too much light can eventually kill your plant. The light intensity can produces increasingly severe damage to your plant to the point where it dies. It can also dry out the plant to the point where it no longer has the water it needs for growth and photosynthesis.\nShould I water my seedlings everyday?\nHow much should you water seedlings? The soil seedlings grow in needs to be moist or wet but not too damp, and it should never dry out between waterings. To achieve this, you should check on your seeds more than once per day, and you’ll probably need to water them at least daily.\nHow close should LED grow lights be to seedlings?\nThere is no universal rule for setting the distance but it’s recommended that LEDs are placed 12 to 18 inches away from the plants. Light is among the most vital factors to consider when growing plants because it triggers the photosynthesis process.\nHow close should light be to seedlings?\nDifferent plants have different light intensity needs, but most seedlings grown for the garden will need higher intensity light to flourish. In general, the leaves should be about 2 – 4 inches away from the light source (assuming use of a fluorescent bulb – see below).\nHow do I make my seedlings stronger?\nPut a small fan next to your seedlings on a timer so that the plants are blown in the breeze for a couple of hours a day and gently passing your hand over the tops of seedlings a few times every day to stimulate stronger growth. Some leggy seedlings can be saved with modified transplanting techniques.\nCan I put tomato seedlings in direct sunlight?\nBright light is super-important for healthy tomato seedlings! Seedlings need 12-18 hours of light each day. Do yourself a favor and give it to them. Otherwise they will become leggy and weak very quickly, which will set back production in your garden.\nCan I leave seedlings out overnight?\nStep 3: Leave seedlings outside overnight\nEventually, allow your plants to stay in full sun and outside overnight as long as night temperatures do not drop below freezing. They can’t stand below-freezing temperatures, even after the seedlings are hardened off. So continue to bring indoors if nights remain cool.\nWhat causes seedlings to wilt?\nSeedlings collapsing from the top & experiencing leaf wilting. If the leaves are wilting, they may also be wilting due to a lack of water – monitor your soil to ensure that it is moist at all times, but not water-logged. Overwatering can happen even to experienced growers.\nHow often should you water your seedlings?\nPlants do best when watered about three times a week, factoring in the rain. If the plants are seedlings, water twice a day until established. But don’t just water without thinking. Feel your soil!\nWhat temperature should seedlings be at?\nAlthough the seeds of some plant species require a temperature as low as 50 degrees Fahrenheit to germinate, the optimal temperature for seedlings is between 65 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit, The Old Farmer’s Almanac says.\nShould I mist my seedlings?\nCombat dry air with humidifiers, misting or humidity trays (draining saucers filled with gravel and water). Your leaves will be dry; fungal spores will have less chance to settle on foliage and the stems of your seedlings will be stronger and more supple if they grow in an area with good air circulation.\nHow do you keep seedlings watered when away?\nMoisten a bath towel and use it to line the bottom of a large, clear-plastic bag. Set the seedlings on top of the towel. Blow air into the bag to inflate it, then seal the bag with a rubber band. When seedlings release water from their leaves, the water will reach the top of the bag, then drip back down into the soil.\nHow often should I mist my seedlings?\nHow often to mist air plants? In this case, mist the plants 3 to 7 times a week, depending how dry your home air is and what time of year. Summertime plants need more water while they can sustain on less in winter.\nAre LED lights good for seedlings?\nSummary. You can use LED lights to start your vegetable seeds indoors and you don’t need special plant grow lights to do so for plants that will eventually be planted outside. If you have a lot of fixtures you can rewire them a few at a time while still gaining the benefits of LED bulbs in all your fixtures.\nHow do you use LED grow lights for seedlings?\nThe answer to this one is simple. Your grow lights should be turned on (or your seedlings should be put under lights) as soon as the first seed starts to sprout. Many types of seedlings grow very fast, and they will begin reaching for the light as soon as they emerge. So give them plenty of it right from the start.\nHow do you know if your plant is getting too much light?\nIf your plant is not getting enough light, the most common sign is the yellowing and dropping of leaves, stunted leaf growth, elongated stems, and a dull-green color. If your plant is getting too much light, then its leaves will have singed tips, burned patches, or will be falling off (yikes!).\nHow many watts do I need for seedlings?\nGrowing seedlings is a great way to jump-start your outdoor garden. One of the challenges to indoor growing is making sure your seedlings get the right amount of light they need to thrive. Seedlings need approximately 32 watts per square foot of growing area for LED grow lights and 100 watts per plant for CFLs.\nWhat is the best fertilizer for seedlings?\nLook for a 1-2-1 N-P-K (nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium) ratio on the fertilizer label. A liquid or water-soluble fertilizer is typically the easiest and quickest way for the seedlings to access nutrients. You’ll also have a choice between organic and synthetic fertilizer, which often comes down to personal preference.\nHow long should seedlings be on a heat mat?\nHow Long Do I Leave My Heating Mat On? Once you sow your seeds and place your plant tray onto your seedling mat, keep it on for 24 hours a day; this process will not involve any intermittent on/off operation. Your seeds must be subjected to consistent heating to keep the propagation process going.\nIs it OK to leave seedlings outside?\nYou can start to harden off your seedlings once they’ve grown at least two to three sets of leaves. At that point, they’re mature enough to move outside. About 7 to 10 days before your seedlings are ready to be transplanted, take them outside and leave them in the shade for a few hours in the morning or afternoon."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4529f989-7dfc-4154-a4a7-31a8b385cdd2>","<urn:uuid:b380d3d6-0790-43ad-9b19-a470f22d5f04>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Could you compare the historical significance and current preservation efforts between the totem poles at Saxman Totem Park in Alaska and the Ġgantija Temples in Gozo? I'm particularly interested in their UNESCO status and conservation initiatives.","answer":"The Saxman Totem Park and Ġgantija Temples have different historical preservation statuses. Saxman Totem Park was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places in 1979, featuring 24 totem poles relocated from abandoned Tlingit villages. The park was established when it was realized totem poles were disappearing through decay. In contrast, the Ġgantija Temples hold UNESCO World Heritage status and are the only such site in Gozo. In 2013, a new visitor center was opened at Ġgantija to help visitors understand the temples' history. The temples are older than both Stonehenge and the Pyramids of Giza, while most existing totem poles are relatively recent, with few examples remaining from before 1900 due to the region's climate.","context":["February 28 - March 5, 2016: Issue 253\nClose-up of decoration above the door to the community house.\nBy George Repin\nTotem poles are monumental sculptures carved by indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast of North America (Alaska in the United States and British Columbia in Canada). Typically they are carved from the highly rot-resistant trunks of Thuja plicata (popularly known as western red cedar). They are not of religious significance but communicate aspects of native culture, such as familiar legends, clan lineages, and notable events or myths. They also may serve as architectural features, welcome signs for visitors to the village and even as mortuary receptacles. The meanings of the designs on totem poles are as varied as the cultures that made them and their placement and importance lay in the observer’s knowledge and connection to the meanings of the figures.\nWhile widespread in the eighteenth century and into the nineteenth century carving of totem poles waned and, in part because of the region’s climate, few examples of poles carved before 1900 remain.\nThe construction of a totem pole is a major undertaking. After a tree is chosen and felled it is moved to the carving site where the bark and sapwood are removed. After deciding the side of the tree to be carved the back half is removed and the trunk hollowed out. Stone, shells and bones originally were the carving tools but from the early 1700s iron tools made the job easier and faster. After carving, the pole is partly painted to bring out only particular features. Generally not much paint is used because the traditional method of preparing paint is long and difficult.\nThe method of raising the pole was to place its end into a deep trench while supporting the other end by a wooden scaffold. Hundreds of strong men then hauled the pole up to a vertical position while others braced the pole with ropes on each side. When the pole was upright the trench was filled with rocks and dirt.\nWhen it was realised that totem poles were disappearing through decay, and little effort was being made to preserve them, the Saxman Totem Park was established in the city of Saxman, 2.3 miles south of Ketchikan in southeastern Alaska. The park displays a collection of totem poles, twenty-four of which were relocated from abandoned Tlingit villages in the area. Other poles were reconstructed by skilled Tlingit carvers under the auspices of the Civilian Conservation Corps in 1930. The park was listed on August 7, 1979 on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places.\nKetchikan is the southeasternmost city in Alaska. It is the first stopping place of cruise ships from Seattle going north in the Inside Passage. Its economy is based on tourism, government services and commercial fishing.

All Rights Reserved.","Maltese heritage is well documented, and thousands of tourists flock to the island every year to view its sites and learn about the stories and people behind them. Perhaps lesser known, but no less rich (and surprisingly different), is Gozo’s heritage. Prolific in story and legend, as well as dating back to the earliest of the Maltese Islands’ inhabitants, Gozo’s heritage is well worth exploring.\nOn such a culturally and historically rich island, where to begin?\nHow about at the beginning? The Ġgantija Temples are a UNESCO World Heritage site (the only such site in Gozo). These megalithic structures date back further than any of the other temples on the Maltese Islands. It feels one is bound by tradition to also point out that they predate Stonehenge and the Pyramids of Giza.\nIn 2013 a new centre was opened the site, allowing visitors to further understand the history of these structures as well as the legends behind the temple. The name Ġgantija is, after all, derived from the Maltese word for ‘giant’, as early inhabitants on the island believed that giants built the massive stone structures.\nThe Gozo Museum of Archaeology delves deeper into the island’s prehistoric heritage. Displaying unique artefacts discovered at several sites around Gozo, the museum gives visitors a taste of what life was like in Gozo across three main historical periods: prehistorical, classical and the medieval/modern.\nThe museum is located in the Citadel, itself one of Gozo’s prime heritage sites. The Citadel dates back to the medieval period, although the site has been inhabited since the Bronze Age. It is Gozo’s only fortified town and is currently undergoing a large-scale restoration project, which has fallen behind schedule due to the new discoveries being unearthed rather frequently.\nThe Citadel is also home to several other museums, including the Cathedral Museum, the Gozo Nature Museum, the Folklore Museum and the Old Prison, where visitors can examine centuries-old graffiti etched into the walls of prison cells.\nSo how is Gozitan heritage different to that of Malta?\nNicoline Sagona, manager of the Gozo sites for Heritage Malta, which handles some of the above mentioned museums, says that Gozo’s heritage diverts from Malta’s at different periods of history.\n“The prehistorical period is similar, so the link between the two islands was there,” she explains. “In Roman times, however, Gozo was independent from Malta. They even had their own coins.\n“In the middle ages, Gozo was used as a place of imprisonment. In fact, right up until a decade after the arrival of the Knights of the Order of St John, Gozo was neglected, whilst Malta was developed.”\nAll throughout the 14th, 15th and 16th centuries, corsairs regularly raided Malta’s sister island, taking the local population away into slavery. The raids began to subside with the rise of tourism.\nAs Nicoline explains, “Tourism in Gozo dates back as far as the Knights, with the rise of the Grand Tour phenomenon – an educational rite of passage popular with the European upper class. The Ġgantija Temples, Fungus Rock and the Citadel were the most popular attractions, taking their place alongside such unmissable antiquities as Pompeii and Rome on European itineraries. We know this because they kept diaries and had artists accompanying them on their travels.”\nGozo, though, remained a place of agriculture and insularity. When the French arrived in Malta, Gozo became independent once again, although much like the Napoleonic occupation of Malta, that proved to be short lived.\nThings started to change under British rule with the introduction of the aqueduct in the 1840s. The economy gradually started shifting into the diverse economy Gozo enjoys today.\nHow about heritage sites outside the Citadel?\nGozo is littered with sites of historical, social or cultural significance.\nXaghra, for instance, is home to a stone circle that dates back to the time of Ġgantija. It used to function as a burial site, similar to Malta’s hypogeum. This, however, is opened on request only.\nThere are other temple sites dotted around the island, although in truth they are in ruins and difficult to spot. A once-sacred site dating back to Phoenician times can be found at Ras il-Wardija, where an unknown cult used to worship their deity.\nFungus rock, near Dwejra, was considered to be almost miraculous, and was strictly guarded by the Knights. A particular kind of plant found only on that rock was believed to have medicinal properties and anyone caught trespassing would be imprisoned or set to work as galley slaves. Today the site is a nature reserve and popular swimming destination.\nReligious and Coastal Sites\nEvery village has a church, all of which are worth a visit. “Santa Ċeċilia chapel is the oldest known standing chapel in Gozo. It has recently been restored and is open to visitors, so I heartily recommend it. Although every village church has its own story to tell,” says Nicoline.\nOne of the most popular is the Ta’ Pinu Sanctuary, a place of pilgrimage for devoted followers of the Blessed Virgin. The minor basilica is believed to be a place of miracles.\nThere are various fortifications along the coast of Gozo. These include forts, gun batteries and a number of watchtowers dating back to the 17th and 18th centuries. Most are undergoing restoration and a couple are open to the public.\n“Heritage Malta is currently working on a new project that is being funded through the EU,” explains Nicoline. “We are creating a big museum for Gozo that will narrate the island’s story under one roof. Hopefully it will be complete by 2018, and it will succinctly combine the wonder of all of Gozo’s heritage treasures,” she adds."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"current"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:773ee39c-0544-4e38-a581-4f114b34b5a1>","<urn:uuid:f930a212-6785-48b6-b21d-51a6d2c04b7e>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Why is it important to harvest sudangrass and sorghum-sudangrass before frost occurs?","answer":"Harvesting before frost is important to optimize forage quality and eliminate potential prussic acid risk and high nitrates. While prussic acid toxicity after frost is usually not an issue when the crop is fully fermented as haylage, it can be a potential issue with sorghums when grazed.","context":["Updated: Apr 11, 2022\nSudangrass and sorghum-sudangrass are warm-season annual grasses from the sorghum family. They are grown in the summer and have the potential to provide high yields of palatable, high quality forage when managed properly. Although rainfall is necessary for optimal growth, they are very drought tolerant and respond well to hot summer weather. They are very frost sensitive, both in the spring as seedlings, as well as in the fall when frost will kill them, preventing any further growth.\nConsider terminating winter injured, low yielding alfalfa fields after first-cut and planting to sorghum-sudangrass or sudangrass for emergency forage. They can also be planted into unseeded soybean and corn acres during a wet year to provide additional forage.\nWhile sorghum-sudangrass has higher yield potential, sudangrass is leafier with much finer stems, which provides higher forage quality. New BMR (brown mid-rib) types of both species are available, which provide low-lignin, higher fibre digestibility (NDFD) for improved forage quality. Yield expectations under optimal weather conditions, management, and timely seeding are 3 – 4 tonnes or more of dry matter per acre. Harvested at the correct stage with good fertility, these crops, particularly BMR types, have high digestible energy and crude protein levels of 15 – 20%. For dairy quality feed, BMR sudangrass is preferred. The BMR sudangrass varieties exclusive to Quality Seeds include SS2.\nSudangrass and sorghum-sudangrass require a soil temperature of at least 15.5 - 18°C (60 - 65°F) for optimal germination, rapid emergence and growth. This typically occurs the last week of may or early-June. They do not perform well in cold soils. While they have very good drought tolerance once established, some rainfall is necessary for germination and early growth.\nSudangrass and sorghum-sudangrass can be no-till drilled following a low yielding alfalfa stand after first-cut and a burndown, or seeded into a prepared seedbed. Sorghum-sudangrass and sudangrass seedlings are not competitive in an existing alfalfa-grass stand, so a burndown or tillage is necessary. No-tilling into an existing stand without a burndown or tillage is usually disappointing. An application of glyphosate, or a “stale seedbed” system (tillage followed by harrowing after weed seedlings emerge) before seeding should be done to prevent excessive weed competition (particularly grasses) to sorghum seedlings. When following an unproductive first-cut, a pre-harvest application of glyphosate can enable an earlier seeding.\nProper seeding depth and seed-to-soil contact is important. Suggested seeding depth for sudangrass is ½ - ¾ inch and ¾ - 1 inch for sorghum-sudangrass. The seedbed should be firm, and well packed after seeding. Seeds planted too deep, or too shallow by broadcasting, frequently result in seeding failures. A no-till drill is best for proper seed placement. A suggested seeding rate for sudangrass is 25 - 30 lbs/ac. A suggested seeding rate for sorghum-sudangrass is sometimes 40 - 50 lbs/ac, but a seeding rate of up to 60 lb/acre can provide a stem that is finer and less coarse, and also provides greater competition against weeds.\nNitrogen (N) is essential for high yield and protein content. A split application of nitrogen should be applied at seeding at a rate of 80 - 90 lbs/acre of actual N (185 lbs urea), and an additional 50 - 60 lb/acre (120 lbs urea) after each cut for the next cutting, depending on yield potential. (50 lbs/acre of actual N for each tonne of expected dry matter yield.) If liquid manure is to be applied, it should preferably be done before planting, or immediately after harvest (within 2 days) and N rates should be adjusted accordingly. There is some susceptibility to heavy traffic damage. P and K removal rates are similar to other grass forage species – approximately 12 lbs P2O5and 50 lbs K2O per ton of dry matter yield.\nGrowth of these species is initially modest, but accelerates very rapidly at about the 7 – 8 leaf stage. Once established at this stage, rapid growth usually out-competes most weeds, and herbicide weed control is not necessary. However, if broadleaf weed pressure is heavy at the seedling stage, herbicide application may be considered. Refer to OMAFRA Publication 75, Guide To Weed Control www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/pub75/pub75A/pub75A.pdf,\np.186. Herbicides include bromoxynil (Pardner) and prosulfuron (Peak + Assist).\nGrowth & Harvest\nAfter seeding, seedlings should emerge within a week given warm soils and adequate moisture. Dry weather can delay emergence.\nFor dairy cow, high quality feed, first-cut typically occurs 40 – 50 days after planting, before the “head emergence” stage, while the crop is 36 – 45 inches in height. Nutrient quality drops quickly and dramatically at heading. A rule-of-thumb is 45 days or 45 inches, whichever comes first. Regrowth is rapid, and a second-cut is usually ready 30 – 35 days later.\nThese species are harvested as haylage or baleage, but because their stems contain high moisture levels, they cannot be dried for hay. A high cutting height of at least 4 inches (leaving 2 growth nodes) is required for faster regrowth. Wide swaths and proper roll conditioning (crimping) enables faster wilting to proper ensiling moisture. Adequate packing for efficient fermentation can sometimes be an issue with coarser stemmed sorghum-sudangrass.\nWhile 2 cuts are common, with timely seeding and aggressive cutting schedules, and without an early frost, 3 cuttings in a season are possible.\nNitrates & Prussic Acid\nIdeally, the final cut of the season should be taken before frost to optimize forage quality and eliminate potential prussic acid risk and high nitrates. Prussic acid toxicity after frost can be a potential issue with sorghums when grazed, but this is usually not an issue as haylage when fully fermented.\nNitrate toxicity is possible with warm-season annual grasses, particularly if harvested following a drought-ending rain, but again, this is also more of an issue with pasture and green-chop. When high nitrates occur, fermentation dissipates the nitrates as nitrogen dioxide (silo gas).\nFor information on how to manage to risk of prussic acid and nitrate poisoning, particularly in green chop and pasture situations, refer to “Forage Sorghum-Sudangrass” at www.omafra.gov.on.ca/english/crops/facts/98-043.htm.\nUsing BMR Sudangrass As A Companion Crop With Forage Underseedings\nThis has been done successfully by farmers in Quebec and on a smaller scale by farmers in Ontario using specific management practises. Quality Seeds did some plot trials in 2019 under Ontario environmental conditions with very promising results. (Figure 3)\nAdditional suggested management practises to consider when underseeding to BMR sudangrass are as follows:\n· Glyphosate burndown and tillage before planting essential\n· 20 lbs/ac sudangrass and 18-20 lbs/ac alfalfa-grass blended together, seeded with a no-till drill through the cereal box at ½ inch seeding depth (maximum), seedbed well packed and firm\n· Nitrogen fertility requirements are the same as above\n· Do not apply manure after planting or harvest - very susceptible to traffic damage\n· Harvest the last cut before September or just before frost, avoiding the critical fall harvest period\nFigure 1 – HayKing II BMR sudangrass planted at 35 lbs/ac on June 18th.

{"question":"How did military conscription and Garibaldi's volunteer forces differ in their approach to nation-building in 19th century Europe?","answer":"Military conscription and Garibaldi's volunteer forces represented contrasting approaches to nation-building. State-mandated conscription developed gradually, requiring citizens to see military service as legitimate and inescapable, while Garibaldi led volunteer armies driven by nationalist ideals. As a counterpoint to traditional military leadership, Garibaldi recruited passionate volunteers, organizing them into forces like the Italian Legion and his famous red-shirted troops, fighting for Italian unification. While conscription was tied to state authority and formal citizenship, Garibaldi's approach relied on willing fighters motivated by nationalist causes, as demonstrated in his successful 1860 campaign in Sicily where he gathered 1,000 volunteers to defeat 25,000 Neapolitan troops.","context":["If military service had become a rite of passage for young men in much of Europe well before the mutual slaughter began in the summer of 1914, neither its ubiquity nor its meaning to those it embraced were foregone conclusions.1 To be sure, the fundamental challenge offered by the declaration of the levée en masse in revolutionary France in 1793 represented an important first step, as did monarchical Prussia’s turn in 1813 to the near-general conscription of those men considered young and fit enough to join the fight. Indeed, Prussia’s response to the Napoleonic challenge intertwined military service, citizenship, and manhood in the gendered construction of a nation at war that bore a striking resemblance to those ideals manifest in the mobilizations of 1914.2 Nonetheless, near-universal manhood conscription took many more decades to predominate on the continent, (never mind the United Kingdom, which did not resort to it until 1916).3\nMoreover, the path was not at all direct, not from the state’s and army’s side nor from the general population’s. For the state and its military leadership, big citizens’ armies could be desirable for fighting a foreign enemy, but they could also present a threat to the domestic-political status quo because they might not allow themselves to be used to suppress protest or insurrection at home. A further decisive factor was technology and how military leaders came to use it. Especially important were the railroads and the development of strategic thought and organizational structures that placed a premium on mobilizing large numbers of men at once for a decisive blow of the kind Helmuth von Moltke pulled off for Prussia at Königgrätz (aka Sadowa) in 1866 and at Sedan in 1870 during the wars that produced a German nation-state.4\nOf course, an approach to war of this kind also required large numbers of trained conscripts and experienced reservists. But first things first. The men targeted by conscription (and then the reserves) and the families and communities in which they had been raised first needed to learn to see the state’s call to the colors as legitimate and inescapable, let alone perceive value in the prospect.\nNineteenth-century discourses and attitudes regarding conscription were informed by normative assumptions about manhood in connection with a wide range of topics—civic or national duty and martial sacrifice, forbearance and manliness, masculinity and bravery, willpower and human flesh versus modern weaponry (especially later in the century), the impact of length of service on soldiers’ relationship to civilian society, civilian upbringings and soldiers’ political reliability, the reputational impact of military service on veterans returning to civilian life, and so on. The gendered matrix of military service and citizenship was integral to warfare and its sociopolitical effects in Europe. This matrix is the subject of the first of three thematic sections comprising this [unrealized] chapter. Ordinary men in uniform occupy the center of this analysis, but other men and women who joined or supported the armed struggles—interstate and intrastate—are also considered.\nThe importance and meaning of conscription in this period was also affected by the increasing cachet of nationality as an organizing principle for the European state system, or at least as a cultural manifestation that states could leverage.5 Whether in the ranks as conscripts, as substitutes for conscripts, as wartime volunteers, or by vocation, soldiers were beginning to be identified—and even identify themselves, at least in wartime—with the nation-state or the national cause that they served. Many fought in conflicts that had national resonance among the general population, such as the Crimean War (1853–56), and many others fought in wars that led to the creation of the Italian and German nation-states (achieved in 1861 and 1871, respectively). The last case also entailed the national humiliation of France—widely felt in that country—in a series of disastrous defeats (1870–71).\nThese conflicts did not just involve soldiers in the service of the state, however. The rise of nationality and “the people” as relevant factors saw men (and even women) join irregular formations to attain their national goals or, in the case of Italy, at least redeem their nation’s honor, whether that meant overturning a foreign or particularistic ruler (especially during the European revolutions of 1848) or defending their nation against a foreign invader or dying in the attempt. Or so the nationalist narratives went, even if some probably took up arms to defend their home and locality against the privations of requisitioning and marauding.\nThese decades also saw men and women (and youth) in cities resort to violence in order to change constitutional structures or protest economic and social conditions. Whether or not any military experience was involved in the barricade building of 1848, memories of earlier revolts had certainly been passed down to the frequently subaltern generations of that time, a legacy that was also evident during the Paris Commune’s struggle in 1871.6 Intertwined with implicit and explicit discourses about citizenship and belonging—and thus about manhood and womanhood, too—these episodes also belonged to the complex, often violent process of nation formation and consolidation. At the same time, in this context of nation-making wars and insurrections, the seemingly contradictory phenomenon of international volunteers serving a national cause must also be considered.7\nThe circles of social actors and norms to potentially include in a gendered analysis of the above mentioned wars and insurrections could be expanded a great deal further, if space constraints and available research permitted it. Whenever gender played a role in constructing or understanding the motivation and practices of those fighting, that role conceptually comprised both masculinity and femininity because gender, like class and race, is a relational concept. If the military world had become almost exclusively male and masculine in the nineteenth century, that manhood still presupposed relationships with women and femininity.\nNormative femininity might be embodied in the appearance and comportment of women accompanying the army (in France, holdovers like the cantinère) or nursing the wounded (in the Crimea, Mary Seacole and Florence Nightingale). There were also the women at home for whom one fought, or the girl one intended to marry after completing active duty. Normative images of women in the minds of soldiers could affect those soldiers’ reactions to encounters with women in wartime, in the course of requisitioning food from civilians or sleeping in civilians’ homes or outbuildings—or when fighting irregulars or taking a town street by street. Finally, a siege army could not make distinctions between soldiers and civilians, men and woman, adults and children in a besieged city (as in the Prussian-German siege of Paris in 1870–71). On the other hand, policy decisions reached in the besieged city itself (or policy lacunae) could create great differences—between rich and poor, soldiers and civilians (and therefore also between men and women), and so on.\nNo matter how powerful memories of the levée en masse continued to be in the middle decades of nineteenth century France, to take the most famous example of a nation in arms, patriotism and élan were not enough to win wars. One also needed professional expertise to train and lead men in war or in the suppression of an insurrection. With different educational levels and frequently a more elevated social background, officers might well embody masculinity differently than the men in their charge, especially if they were noblemen. Furthermore, as military technologies grew and military organizations became more complex, the knowledge required by at least some of the officers expanded. As the job changed, so too could the men doing it.\nThese developments were accompanied by public and internal debates about military leadership. What qualities did officers require? From which stock was recruitment most desirable? What training did they require? What was their relationship to their men supposed to look like? How did they treat their subordinates? And what about their relationship to acknowledged social equals and supposed inferiors—especially men—outside the military? How did their expertise and comportment figure into their practice of masculinity and its reception? What did military service and sacrifice mean to these men? How did social background and family history shape that meaning? Finally, what about their private lives? How did marriage and family fit into their military careers? To what extent did the bourgeois ideal of a separate domestic sphere obtain in this context? Of course, each of these questions could lead to more than one answer because officer corps were by no means homogeneous.8 Furthermore, some important military leaders did not fit within this framework at all, most prominently Giuseppe Garibaldi, whose biography, relationship to his fighters, and influential public image form an instructive counterpoint.9\nMoreover, if soldiers were citizens acting on behalf of the nation, their actions might be expected to bear a closer relationship to the values and norms that guided their behavior in civilian life. Actual or alleged practices in wartime that appeared contrary to the predominant normative conception of war—still largely informed by the metaphor of a dual between two equal and honorable parties—exposed the perpetrator to charges of acting in an unmanly or unwomanly way and, by extension, his or her nation to charges of dishonorable, uncivilized behavior. Purported atrocities and other perceived wrongdoings also created opportunities for soldiers to exact revenge with drastic countermeasures that could contradict taboos on destroying property and even those on killing women.\nOf course, such measures were never just about the attitudes of soldiers, but also the command climate, discipline, and policy goals. Furthermore, gendered contemporary reports and commentaries on the violence could be more about demonizing the enemy than about actual events or understanding what happened. The main examples explored in this section involve face-to-face encounters between German soldiers and French civilians in 1870–71 and the extreme use of violence by Thiers’s forces against the Commune in 1871.10\nAll three sections [so was my plan] proceed from the fundamental premise that practices and experiences of manhood and womanhood are historically contingent, that men and women change over time, that normative masculinities and femininities change with them. The seemingly natural in their attitudes and behaviors is cultural and therefore a product of history. The second corollary premise is that war and warriors are creatures of their times, influenced by—and influencing—them. Contrary to many narrowly conceived histories, not to mention widespread ahistorical elements of popular culture, there is no universal soldier or military leader.11 Here, too, biology need not be destiny, whereas culture, if not properly analyzed in historical context, very well could be.12\nThe third premise is that although the dual political and technological revolutions of the nineteenth century match up chronologically with the emergence of “total war” in the twentieth century, the journey never involved only a single plot line that led inexorably to 1914. Focusing on the role of gender—a fundamental component of human culture—can help to make other formative strands of the story visible. It then becomes possible to complicate Stig Förster’s powerful typology of warfare’s development in the modern era—cabinet war, people’s war, industrialized people’s war, and total war—whose emphasis on parallel developments in war and politics can resemble a teleology, one subverted by events after 1945 and hard to reconcile with developments in warfare in other eras and cultures. 13\nFeatured image: Detail from “Combat at the military station: Of Chateau d’ Eau, 24th February 1848 / combat au poste: Du Château d’ Eau, 24 Févr. 1848,” Library of Congress PPOC, http://www.loc.gov/pictures/item/90716191/.

Rome today\nGiuseppe Garibaldi and his Achievements for Italy\nThe son of a seaman, he was born on July 4, 1807, in Nice, which is now in France but was then an Italian town. From his earliest years he loved adventure, and at the age of 15 tried to run away to sea. With his father's agreement he later went to sea and by the time he was 25 had worked his way from cabin boy to captain.\nIn 1832 came the turning point of Garibaldi's life, for he met another Italian, Giuseppe Mazzini, who was the organiser of the “Young Italy” movement. At this time Italy was made up of several separate states, many of which were ruled by kings who paid no attention to the wishes of their people. Great parts of what is now northern Italy belonged to Austria. The members of the “Young Italy” movement sought to drive out the Austrians, to unite all the states into one country and to set up one government for the whole country. They were determined to make that government democratic; that is, to have a government that would rule in accordance with the wishes of the people.\nIn 1834 Garibaldi helped Mazzini to organise a rebellion in Savoy (northem Italy). The attempt failed, Garibaldi fled to France, was sentenced to death in his absence and went to live in exile in South America. For 12 years he led a band of men who were fighting for the Republic of the Rio Grande, which was rebelling against Brazil. He suffered shipwreck, imprisonment and torture so bravely that his followers worshipped him. He organised other Italian exiles into an army known as the Italian Legion, which in 1843 and 1846 saved Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, from attack by Argentina.\nIn 1848 Garibaldi returned to Italy and found the north Italians in revolt against the Austrians. He formed and fought with a volunteer army of 3,000 men, but after the Italians were defeated had to escape to Switzerland. In 1849 he was back in Italy, defending Rome against the French. The people of Rome had rebelled against the government of the Pope (who at that time ruled over great areas in the same way as an ordinary king), and set up their own government. France sent 30,000 men to fight for the Pope and when these troops attacked Rome, Garibaldi organised the defence of the city while Mazzini controlled its government. Garibaldi's troops, wearing their famous red shirts, were defeated, but most of them managed to escape, and Garibaldi went to the United States. Returning to Europe in 1854, he settled on Caprera, a tiny island off Sardinia.\nIn 1859 Garibaldi was fighting the Austrians in north Italy once more, this time successfully. In May 1860, with 1,000 volunteers, he landed on the island of Sicily (off southern Italy) where the people were suffering under the brutal rule of King Francis of Naples. Within three months 25,000 of King Francis's troops were defeated, and Garibaldi led his men to the mainland of Italy, won the Battle of Reggio and marched on Naples. Francis fled and his kingdom of southern Italy was handed over to King Victor Emmanuel of Sardinia, who afterwards became King of the whole of Italy. Garibaldi, rejecting all offers of wealth and titles, returned to his simple farm on the island of Caprera.\nFrom there in 1862 he returned once more to raise an army and march on Rome, which was still a separate state ruled by the Pope. However, Victor Emmanuel did not want further strife and forced Garibaldi to stop. In 1867 he tried again and was defeated by the Pope's army, which had French troops fighting with it.\nGaribaldi retired to his farm and died at the age of 75, honoured and mourned throughout the nation he had fought to free."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"historical"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"expert_specialist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c92570af-6b21-431e-a259-e9922728910a>","<urn:uuid:310f4f3a-94d3-4a1c-a4e5-35da4e5c6665>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Do both bank loans and current accounts require documentation of assets, such as property or equipment?","answer":"Yes, but in different ways. For bank loans, assets like equipment, real estate, and personal property are required as collateral to secure the loan. For current accounts, while proof of business assets may be needed as business proof (such as Shop & Establishment documentation), they are not required as security like in loans.","context":["Web definition for a bank loan is a medium-term form of finance\nobtained from a commercial bank or other similar financial\ninstitution. The loan may be secured on the entity’s assets and\nthe interest charged may be variable.\nA loan from a bank can be of different types. A loan to buy\nconsumer durable goods, such as, a car or furniture is a personal\nloan but also called a bank loan.\nA mortgage from a bank is similarly called a bank loan.

Character means more than not having a\ncriminal record. The banker should feel confident that you are not\ngoing to suddenly disappear to some unknown place if the business\nruns into trouble. Specifically bankers like to see ties to the\ncommunity such as long residence, family ties, and home ownership.\nA person taking a loan should have clean credit history. A couple\nof late credit card payments doesn’t matter much, but if a person\nis missing mortgage payments for three months in a row will\nrequire a good explanation. Bankers like, good character and good\ncredit, but they live for solid collateral. (Equipment, buildings\nand trucks--that's the kind of stuff that bankers really like for\ncollateral--) even if the business goes bust these solid value are\nlikely to be worth a lot. Inventory, raw material and goods are\nsecond choices for collateral--they will lose their value more\nquickly than fixed assets but still be worth something.\nBanks usually consider the interest rate, usually described as the\nAnnual Percentage Rate or APR. if you're borrowing a lot of money\nover a long period The differences can be dramatic . The\ndifference between 7% and 10% doesn't look like much on paper, but\nit's likely to make a difference of several hundred pounds to your\nFixed APRs are a good idea, especially at the moment when the\neconomy's worn out.

You can skip three consecutive payments if\ntimes are hard; it's worth having because you don't know what's\nround the corner. Some firms also let you vary your payments, so\nyou can pay more when you're loaded and less when you're broke.\nPrior approaching to bank, you should have all of your key\ndocuments in order, starting with a solid business plan. You will\nalso need to have the most recent financial statements available,\nprojections for the business (this is typically in the business\nplan) and a repayment plan, plus collateral.\nCollateral may include:\n• Hard goods such as equipment\n• Real estate\n• Stocks or bonds\n• other personal assets\n• Personal guarantees","Current bank account is opened by businessmen who have a higher number of regular transactions with the bank. It includes deposits, withdrawals, and contra - transactions. It is also known as Demand Deposit Account.\nWhat is the type of information I need to submit to the Bank at the time of account opening?\nYou need to submit the information to establish your identity and your address and a copy of your latest photograph.

Such an information assists the Bank in identifying any unusual transactions that are being routed through it.\nYou are repeatedly mentioning that the extant regulations of RBI and the rules notified under Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002. What do they really talk about and try to achieve?\nThe regulations and the rules referred to above deal with what is called as an initiative of Anti Money Laundering (AML) and Countering the Terrorist Financing (CTF). These rules and regulations try to prevent the process of money laundering (i.e., the process of dealing with criminal proceeds and projecting it as untainted property through banking channels) and financing of terrorism related activities. The regulations, in the broadest sense, require the banks to know their customers (popularly known as the Know Your Customer or KYC regulations) and to monitor their transactions. Further, specified information under the PMLA about the cash and suspicious transactions need to be submitted to the Financial Intelligence Unit, India (FIU- IND, a Government of India department, which analyses and forwards the intelligence information to the law enforcement agencies). Compliance with AML regulations assists the banks and the society at large in keeping a close watch on the transactions to identify suspicious transactions, if any, and thereby provide intelligence information (through reports to FIU-IND) to the law enforcement authorities to deal with such transactions as per the applicable laws and regulations. Co-operating with the Bank by providing required information, assists the Bank and the society in a long way in their fight against money laundering and terrorist financing."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"answer_length","category_name":"concise"},{"categorization_name":"temporal_focus","category_name":"atemporal"},{"categorization_name":"multilingual_categorization","category_name":"monolingual"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_language_proficiency","category_name":"english_native_fluent"},{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_profile","category_name":"knowledgeable_generalist"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:b4633e43-67a6-4aef-8d60-afb8ab61a144>","<urn:uuid:466bae0a-026c-4988-92d0-868df9e95331>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the financial benefit of DIY butchery vs. making Roti Jala from scratch?","answer":"DIY butchery offers clear financial advantages - breaking down a whole chicken costing £5 can yield multiple meals (two breasts, two legs, wings, and soup from the carcass), compared to buying just two chicken breasts for the same price. In contrast, making Roti Jala from scratch is more time-intensive than cost-effective, requiring individual preparation and cooking of each piece, taking up to 45 minutes to make 12 pieces to feed a household.","context":["As for every curry dish, it is best eaten with bread like side dish, mainly because bread soaks up the gravy and it is undeniable that the gravy is what makes any curry or Rendang outstanding in flavor. There are many types of flour dough made products that can be the choice of a curry person and the options are endless from Roti Canai, Murtabak, plain white bread to rice itself. I have chosen Roti Jala for today's dish as I have never made it before despite having bought the mould 5 years ago and I love the turmeric yellow color which goes well with the brown Rendang. 'Jala' is another Malay word that means Net as in fish net and this particular Roti is named so for its particular appearance that resembles a web of net all mingled together with its holes randomly scattered.\nIn the whole process of preparing this dish with its accompanying Roti, I would say the Roti was the one that tested my patience and I found the Roti Jala mould difficult to swirl around and some of its funnel holes simply get clogged after a few rounds of the batter filling. I was about to give up after making the third piece when I suddenly remembered I have a better tool to do the job. I used the usual condiment ketchup bottle that they have at the American Diners to complete the next 10 Roti Jala. It was much easier to handle and squirts out even amount of batter everytime. Still, getting one piece to cook nicely with slight burnt color is not an easy thing to do as each piece has to be made and cooked individually and it takes up a long time to make 12 to feed everyone in my household. Of course, I got the rice cooked too as I wasn't ready to spend another 45 minutes to do another round of 12 more Roti Jala!\nThe results were good and Curry and his father really enjoyed dipping those Roti into the spicy Rendang.

Diana Pilkington gets to know the cuts during a crash course in butchery, and picks up some tips from real-life butcher (and one half of TV's Fabulous Baker Brothers) Henry Herbert. Plus, some tasty meat recipes.\nBy Diana Pilkington\nYou don't expect to walk into your local butcher's shop and see a glamorous TV star behind the counter.\nBut Henry Herbert, one half of Channel 4's Fabulous Baker Brothers, is juggling his TV career with running family business Hobbs House Butchery in Chipping Sodbury, Gloucestershire.\nAnd he has seen such a rise in people who want to learn some basic butchery skills that he's in the process of opening a school to teach them.\n\"There's a thirst for people wanting to learn how to do it themselves,\" he says.\n\"They might not do it every time, but understanding the skill behind it helps you appreciate what the trade involves. It's like when people want to do a bit of DIY at home but won't necessarily do the whole house.\n\"If you cook a leg of lamb that you had boned out yourself, there's kudos in that.\"\nThere can also be financial benefits to getting handy with a knife at home.\nHerbert says: \"A small chicken is about £5. It's about the same price as two skinless chicken breasts, but there's quite a big difference in size.\n\"It's so quick to learn how to chop that chicken up and get two breasts, two legs, wings and a carcass to make a soup, so suddenly you've gone from two meals to five meals. I could teach someone that in five minutes and they've got that for life.\"\nEven if home butchery is not your thing, the star is supporting a campaign to encourage people to use their local butcher and tap into their expert knowledge about which cuts to buy and how to use them.\nAfter all, trained chef Herbert took over his family butcher's in the first place to help keep the trade alive when the shop became vacant.\nThe number of butcher shops in Britain has declined sharply since the Seventies, dropping from 25,300 in 1977 to just 6,811 in 2006. However, according to Eblex, which represents the English beef and sheep industry, the drop in numbers is tailing off and there are around 6,600 today.\n\"I felt it was a real shame to see another butcher shop that had been trading for 150 years close down and become a card shop or a charity shop,\" he says.\n\"I thought even if I can breathe some new life into it and help inspire someone at least I've done something rather than watch it shut down.\"\nA butcher's at how it's done\nI admit it, I love red meat. But I don't think I'm alone in being a bit clueless about how a juicy sirloin steak or comforting Sunday roast correspond to the animals they start out as.\nWith this in mind, I take a trip to the Donald Russell butchery in Aberdeenshire, proud holder of a Royal Warrant, for a tour of the premises and a crash course in butchery skills.\nLed by the aptly-named Steve Lamb, I wander through the ice-cold maturation room, where hundreds of headless carcasses hang side by side. Beef is typically hung for around 28 days to give it maximum flavour, and lamb, which I learn is anatomically very similar to a cow, is hung for up to 10 days.\nThroughout the factory are a staggering number of white-coated people hard at work, some carefully weighing and portioning the steaks, others chucking meat into a mincer, lining pastry with sausage meat or packing up the cuts.\nThey all carry out their tasks with impressive speed and precision. And then it's my turn.\nIn the demonstration room, I watch as butcher Dave Bergin uses a saw and various knives to break down the 'roasting' (a side of beef) into the four main cuts of rib, sirloin, fillet and rump.\nIt is quite a transformation, and what starts out as a generous, multi-coloured bit of fillet, for example, is trimmed down into a sleek piece of pure red meat that resembles a fish to look at.\nNext is the fun part. With my left hand encased in a chainmail glove, I have a go at cutting these newly-butchered slabs into steaks. It's satisfying to sink the knife in, but my task - to chop them to an optimum 220 grams - is not easy, and I keep missing the mark. Fellow butcher Andy Grant, on the other hand, gets it right every time.\nThere's also a baffling array of words to come to terms with. As well as the familiar steaks, I hear terms like \"pave\", \"picanha\" and \"tafelspitz\" bandied about. More confusingly, some are different words for the same thing, but the butchers navigate the language with ease.\nDespite a growing interest from the public in butchery, the team at Donald Russell tell me that they have struggled to find young apprentices to go into the trade.\n\"Nobody wants to get up at 4.30am to come to a cold factory and cut up steaks,\" admits Grant, who has done the job for 20 years. \"But it's given me a good life. It's a job I feel passionate about and I enjoy it.\" Impressed as I am by his skills though, I think I'll leave him to it.\nHere are some meaty recipes for you to try at home.\nSlow-cooked beef with gnocchi\n450g lean boneless shin or chuck steak, cut into 2.5cm cubes\nSalt and freshly milled black pepper\n½tsp cayenne pepper\n2tbsp sunflower oil\n1 large onion, peeled and chopped\n2 large garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped or crushed\n2 x 400g cans chopped tomatoes\n200ml good, hot vegetable stock\n1 cinnamon stick, halved\n1tbsp light brown sugar\n1tbsp tomato puree\n1 x 400g pack fresh gnocchi\n2tbsp freshly chopped flat-leaf parsley, to garnish\nPlace the beef in a large plastic food bag.
