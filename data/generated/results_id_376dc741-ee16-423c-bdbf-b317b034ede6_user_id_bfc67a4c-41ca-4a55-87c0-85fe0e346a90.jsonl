{"question":"How do community engagement approaches differ between South African food culture and American university social justice initiatives?","answer":"In South African food culture, community engagement is demonstrated through Siba's family tradition of welcoming people who had less than them to their table, and her modern work as a Foodbank South Africa ambassador. In American university settings, community engagement occurs through organized initiatives like the Social System Design Lab at Washington University, where students bring together community stakeholders to address issues like racial tension, gun violence, and youth homelessness through youth summits. While both approaches aim to address social issues, the South African model operates through food and hospitality, while the American university model uses structured programs and formal summits to facilitate community dialogue.","context":["You can’t be a South African foodie without knowing Siba, who like Jamie and Nigella, has earned that golden first-name-only status. The TV chef with the infectious personality and killer smile who grew up in a humble Eastern Cape township is on a global rise… managing to look perpetually happy and glamorous while cooking food that’s calling your name. Well, actually her name…as it’s all “Siba-licious!”\nEven though she’s got charm, a global palate and contemporary style in spades, I think it is Siba Mtongana’s authenticity that is her greatest drawcard. What you see is what you get from this magnetic culinary force and mega role model, who is grounded by strong Xhosa roots and family values. I’m not spouting hype here; it’s my own perception…and yes, I did meet her.\nFirst a few facts: Siba is the first South African to have her own television show broadcast on The Cooking Channel in the US, with a reach of 60 million homes. Siba’s Table is now aired in more than 130 countries in Africa, the UK, Europe, the Middle East, US, Australia and Asia. She made Oprah Magazine’s prestigious 2014 O Power List of 21 African Women Rocking the World, and is an active do-gooder, as Foodbank South Africa ambassador and participant in many charity events. Which leads me to how I met Siba.\nIt would be an understatement to say that my jaw dropped to the floor when Siba, who lives and shoots her shows in Cape Town, accepted an invitation to speak at a charity breakfast at my daughters’ school last year (for Rotary’s Interact Club, which she had headed at her own high school). For non-South Africans, I’d say it would be like Nigella Lawson agreeing to show up at your kid’s school to talk about her life’s journey and favourite dishes.\nAt the event, before Siba even got started, she walked around the audience of mostly white faces, saying hello, schmoozing and hugging nearly everyone. Then she spoke… about her humble beginnings, and how there were always people sitting around her family’s table who had less than she did…and always made to feel welcome by her parents. Her rise to success which began with a Food and Consumer Sciences degree from Cape Peninsula University of Technology, where she mentored and tutored academically struggling students from previously disadvantaged backgrounds. How for three years she was a Sunday School teacher in her local church in Langa, where she encountered immense poverty and hunger among the children of that community. And how she made the epic leap from cooking instructor to magazine food editor to TV show host.\nAs a speaker, Siba had her audience enthralled, and the story of her journey was inspiring on many levels. I also loved what she had to say about food; most interesting to me was her easy-going embrace of both tradition and modernity, of South African and global flavours – and how she weaves them all together.\nRecently, Siba answered a few of my questions about the role of traditional South African food in her life.\nQ. Where did you grow up and how did this shape your personal culinary heritage?\nA. I grew up in East London in a township called Mdantsane, in the Eastern Cape. I have such great memories of my mother cooking our traditional food in our home kitchen and somehow even today those teachings form a firm foundation for my cooking, which touches on traditional food here and there, but with a modern twist.\nQ. What were some of your favourite childhood dishes?\nA. My favourite was mfino (spinach or wild leaves cooked in sautéed onions, mixed with maize meal and cooked until a somewhat crumbly yet mashed potato-like mixture). It was what my mom used to make for us after school. I loved samp and beans (umngqusho) with meat stews and veggies. I also enjoyed umphokoqo or krummel pap (white maize meal) with milk or maas (sour milk) and many other things. And, I liked pasta dishes and adding a variety of vegetables from my mom’s veggie garden.\nQ. Do you make them now in the traditional way, or do you translate them into modern versions?\nA. There are times when I just crave something traditional; especially when I’m feeling nostalgic. Then there are other times when I want something traditional but with a bit of a modern flair. I do this often when I want to kill two birds with one stone: teaching people how to make the traditional food and how to make it a little more modern. Often traditional food is only exciting to those who grew up eating it, so I give it a twist to make it attractive to others who perhaps would find it boring or bland in its traditional state. So you teach and inspire at the same time.\nFor example, I’ve turned mfino into wonderful canapés with soy mayonnaise and hot smoked salmon. And, I created the ‘papizza’, which is pizza with a stiff pap base.\nQ. Many foods in the traditional diet are high in starch. Is health more of a consideration for you in terms of what you like to cook today, and how does this tie into traditional foods?\nA. Being in the food space and a person who influences what people eat, health is definitely something on my mind. This is true when creating my recipes or when cooking at home, as I am also a mom. Contrary to what some people believe, our traditional food is generally low in fat, and high in starch with lots of vegetables often accompanied by protein. It’s more the Western side of our diet, with food high in fat, starch and sugar, that is detrimental to our health than the traditional side.\nQ. Is it better to keep some dishes/foods purely traditional, rather than to try to adapt them?\nA. It depends on how traditional you are and who you are cooking for at that time. When I visit my home in the Eastern Cape, my parents appreciate some of the things I cook in which I modify traditional food. But I know there is a special place for something authentically traditional like krummel pap or mphokoqo with maas for instance, and I often don’t want to tamper with that. But for a friend from abroad who thinks its bland – I’d add a little sugar and they’d appreciate it more.\nAll images courtesy of Food Network.","March 15th & 16th\n“Systems Thinking and the Mission to Mars”\nRocket scientists are hard at work trying to get the first humans to Mars– but these engineers and innovators are not the only ones who play a role in this mission.

Dutch colonizers in present-day New York State brought the celebration of Pinkster to North America in the 17th century. However, by the 19th century, Pinkster had evolved into a primarily African-American holiday, celebrated by enslaved and free Black people, including African music, song and dance.\nSome time between 1811 and 1813 despite or perhaps because of its popularity, the city of Albany, New York passed an ordinance banning the drinking and dancing associated with Pinkster. White leaders were concerned that the congregation and socialization of large groups of African Americans could provide them with the opportunity to plot or plan revolution. This law was only repealed in 2011.\n(more info below)\nCelebrating the Black and African-diasporic Community of Harlem\nHarlem has long since been a space for the black and African-diasporic community to gather. According to the Collection of the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture:\n\"With the end of the Civil War in 1865, hundreds of thousands of African Americans newly freed from the yoke of slavery in the South began to dream of fuller participation in American society, including political empowerment, equal economic opportunity, and economic and cultural self-determination. Unfortunately, by the late 1870s, that dream was largely dead, as white supremacy was quickly restored to the Reconstruction South. White lawmakers on state and local levels passed strict racial segregation laws known as “Jim Crow laws” that made African Americans second-class citizens... Hate groups like the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) perpetrated lynchings and conducted campaigns of terror and intimidation to keep African Americans from voting or exercising other fundamental rights.\nWith booming economies across the North and Midwest offering industrial jobs for workers of every race, many African Americans realized their hopes for a better standard of living—and a more racially tolerant environment—lay outside the South. By the turn of the 20th century, the Great Migration was underway as hundreds of thousands of African Americans relocated to cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, Detroit, Philadelphia, and New York.\nThe Harlem section of Manhattan, which covers just three square miles, drew nearly 175,000 African Americans, giving the neighborhood the largest concentration of black people in the world. Harlem became a destination for African Americans of all backgrounds. From unskilled laborers to an educated middle-class, they shared common experiences of slavery, emancipation, and racial oppression, as well as a determination to forge a new identity as free people.\nThe Great Migration drew to Harlem some of the greatest minds and brightest talents of the day, an astonishing array of African American artists and scholars. Between the end of World War I and the mid-1930s, they produced one of the most significant eras of cultural expression in the nation’s history—the Harlem Renaissance... Alain Locke, a Harvard-educated writer, critic, and teacher who became known as the “dean” of the Harlem Renaissance, described it as a “spiritual coming of age” in which African Americans transformed “social disillusionment to race pride.” T\nhe Harlem Renaissance encompassed poetry and prose, painting and sculpture, jazz and swing, opera and dance. What united these diverse art forms was their realistic presentation of what it meant to be black in America, what writer Langston Hughes called an “expression of our individual dark-skinned selves,” as well as a new militancy in asserting their civil and political rights.\"","The Smithsonian National Museum of African Art has the largest publicly held collection of contemporary African art in the United States including more than 10,000 objects representing nearly every country in Africa dating from ancient to contemporary times. The collection contains a variety of media and art forms—textiles, photography, sculpture, pottery, paintings, jewelry and video art.\nFounded in l964 as a private educational institution, the Museum of African Art initially occupied a town house once owned by Frederick Douglass, a former slave, abolitionist and statesman.\nIn 1979, the Museum of African Art became part of the Smithsonian Institution and in 1981 it was officially renamed the National Museum of African Art. In 1987, the museum was relocated to its current facility on the National Mall. The museum is the only national museum in the United States dedicated to the collection, exhibition, conservation and study of the arts of Africa.

Thermal inactivation of avian influenza virus and Newcastle disease virus in a fat-free egg product. Journal of Food Protection. 74(7):1161-1168.\nInterpretive Summary: The United States produces and exports internationally a large amount of egg product. Although the U.S. is normally free of avian influenza and Newcastle disease viruses, concern about contamination of egg product with these viruses has in the past resulted in restrictions on trade. Because these egg products are normally pasteurized, this study was performed to see if normal pasteurization times and temperatures would be effective at inactivating viruses in fat-free liquid egg product at various times and temperatures of heat processing. Fat free egg product could be categorized as either imitation egg product or liquid egg white as it contained at least 99 percent egg white. The USDA pasteurization standard for imitation egg products is 56.7 degrees C with a minimum holding time of 4.6 min while the pasteurization standard for egg white with unadjusted pH is 57.7 degrees C with a minimum holding time of 6.3 min. These pasteurization standards are based on a 5 log reduction of Salmonella. Both of these standard pasteurization processes were used to inactivate two avian influenza (AI) viruses and two Newcastle disease viruses (NDV) to determine if these pasteurization processes would adequately inactivate 100,000 virus/ ml of fat free egg product. Usage of this data in developing egg pasteurization standards for AI and NDV infected countries should allow safe trade in liquid egg products.\nTechnical Abstract: Avian influenza (AI) and Avian Paramyxovirus Type-1 (AMPV-1) viruses can survive on the carcasses, in organ tissue of infected birds, on fomites, and have the potential for egg transmission and egg product contamination. With the increase in global trade, there are concerns that egg products could potentially present biosecurity problems and affect international trade in liquid and dried egg products. Therefore, the generation of inactivation curves to determine thermal death times (D-value) and heat resistance of the viruses (Z-value) within fat-free egg product (FFEP) would provide valuable information in the development of risk assessment strategies. Thermal inactivation studies using A/chicken/Pennsylvania/1370/83 (H5N2) high pathogenicity AI (HPAI) virus, artificially inoculated into FFEP at 6.25 log10 mean embryo infectious doses (TID50)/ml was heat treated for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 15 and sometimes up to 40 min. The resulting thermal death times D55, D56, D56.7, D57, D58, D59 values were 18.6, 8.5, 3.6, 2.5, 0.4, 0.4 min, respectively. The Z-value was 4.4 degree C. For low pathogenicity AI (LPAI) virus A/chicken/New York/13142/94 (H7N2) inoculated at 6.9 log10 TID50/ ml had D55, D56.7, D57, D58, D59, D60 values of 2.9, 1.4, 0.8, 0.7, 0.7, and 0.5 min, respectively, and a Z-value of 0.4 degree C. For virulent Newcastle disease virus (vNDV) AMPV-1/chicken/California/212676/2002 inoculated at 8.75 log10 TID50/ ml resulted in D55, D56, D56.7, D57, D58, D59 values of 12.4, 9.3, 6.2, 5, 3.7, and 1.7 min respectively. The Z-value was 4.7 degree C. While for lentogenic NDV AMPV-1/chicken/United States/B1/1948 inoculated at 8.4 log10 TID50/ ml resulted in D53, D55, D57, D58, D59, and D61 values of 5.3, 2.4, 2.3, 0.62, 0.19, and 0.17 min, respectively and a Z-value of 1.6 degree C. Usage of this data in developing egg pasteurization standards for AI and NDV infected countries should allow safe trade in liquid egg products.","This review discusses the benefits seen of heat treatment during storage in order to reduce embryonic mortality caused by prolonged storage in avian species.\nHeat treatment during storage\nThe longer eggs are stored, the higher the losses in hatchability. Stored eggs have a higher rate of embryonic mortality between days 2 and 3 of incubation, and need more time to complete incubation. This causes some live chicks to be rejected at take-off because they hatch too late. Several studies have investigated the possibility to limit the hatchability loss after long storage by applying short periods of heat treatment during storage, with differing results. Heat treatment for stored eggs has been around since the 1950’s, most commonly known as SPIDES but also known as PRESI in Canada and IDEAS in Turkey. In recent years, more and more successful attempts have been reported applying heat treatment during storage, even for large-scale trials. Nicholson (2012) and Aviagen (2014) have shown a consistent improvement of the hatchability of long stored eggs (Ross 308 & Ross 708 broiler eggs, as well as various GP & GGP lines) by applying one or more heat treatments in 34 small to large-scale trials.\nEffect of storage according to developmental stage\nDevelopment of the avian embryo begins immediately after fertilization in the infundibulum and continues as albumen and shell are deposited over the next 24-26 hours. The embryonic developmental stage at the moment of oviposition (egg laying) is variable for different genetic lines as well as parental ages. This may be genetically determined or linked to variations in oviductal transit time and/or body temperature. The effect of long storage times on embryonic development highly depends on the developmental stage of the embryos at oviposition. Although there are variations of staging at point of lay, according to breed type, etc. the stage should always be well away from the “point of no return”. However collection timing, farm storage, transport, etc. can all affect the embryo stage if the eggs are poorly managed and it must be remembered that to fill a commercial incubator will usually take more than one days egg collection or eggs from more than one farm. It has been reported that embryos at the pre-gastrula stage at oviposition are less able to withstand prolonged storage compared to embryos at the gastrula stage. For these embryos, incubation during storage may improve hatchability, since it can advance them to the developmental stage in which hypoblast formation is complete. In contrast, if development is already well advanced and embryos have started to form the primitive streak, incubation during storage may be detrimental since it brings the embryo in a more advanced stage of primitive streak formation (to around stage 3/4 H&H, 1951, period of active cellular migration and differentiation). Storage during such a period could impede critical embryonic processes. So there is some sort of “point of no return”- once this is reached, the embryonic development cannot be stopped anymore via returning the eggs to cold storage.\nHow does heat treatment during storage help?\nIn the egg holding room, eggs are kept at or under a so-called threshold temperature or physiological zero for development. However, some partial, but not a global or proportionate development can take place at these subthreshold temperatures. Different cells or tissues in these early embryos may have different threshold temperatures for development, resulting in uneven or disproportionate development. When this disproportionate development progresses too far it may interfere with embryonic viability and, hence also hatchability. Total heat treatment aims to be around 12 hours, but this will depend on egg size, cold store temperatures and egg temperature at removal. Using current technology adapted to work in a specialised way, has allowed the process to be refined to give accurate and consistent results irrespective of egg age, breed, size, egg weight or storage time of the loaded eggs. This consistency would the answer the question as to why previous heat treatments have been shown to give a benefit but with varying levels of success.\nStoring eggs is an inevitable practice when incubating eggs on commercial scale. It is impossible to synchronize breeder egg production with final product production, which often generates high levels of losses. Heat treatment during egg storage allows a significant reduction in these logistical discrepancies. There is undoubtedly a huge potential in restoring the hatchability of stored eggs, and even improving post-hatch performance. The initial series of commercial trials demonstrated that the operational parameters required in order to achieve a degree of benefits was relatively broad; however achieving the optimal gains considerably narrowed the parameter limitations. Add to this the logistical need to minimize space usage within the hatchery, it was clear there is a need for dedicated, accurate equipment that has a practical capacity. It is crucial to accurately and consistently control the key incubation parameters, as inadequate application of the technique will result in suboptimal results or might even lead to major losses. The precise measurement and control of the egg shell temperature in the incubator, as well as a controlled and uniform warm-up and cool-down phases of the eggs, are key to achieve consistent, optimal gains. The trials currently being undertaken under precise controlled conditions indicate gains can be achieved on eggs with relatively short storage. Taking an immature embryo to a more robust developmental stage either prior to or during initial storage has a major effect on embryonic viability as this gain is seen in the improved hatch of set figures.\nPresented at the 9th Turkey Science and Production Conference"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:c497fd74-0790-4c9c-b835-ae633691a815>","<urn:uuid:64d212a6-3d01-4565-aea3-3571399641d2>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm researching early female religious leaders - how did Jarena Lee become the first woman pastor in the AME church?","answer":"Jarena Lee, who was born free in New Jersey, found her path to religious leadership after experiencing spiritual struggles. She first attended an Episcopalian church at age 20, but faced segregation there. Upon finding an AME church, she had a powerful spiritual experience and later heard a voice telling her to preach the Gospel. Despite initial doubts, she became the first woman pastor in the AME church. She spent 20 years traveling across North America by foot, preaching the Gospel, and became a significant figure in the Second Great Awakening.","context":["History is full of Black heroes who changed the world in ways that benefitted all of us. We’ve all learned about people like Dr. King, Sojourner Truth, and George Washington Carver, but there are so many others that left a mark on the world that have been neglected in most history classes.\nEach of these women broke through stereotypes and flew past the limitations society had placed on them because of their gender and race, and we’re all better off because of their perseverance and diligence.\n1. Phyllis Wheatley\n(1753 – 1784)\nPhyllis Wheatley was born free in Africa. When she was about 7 years old, she was captured and sent to Boston, purchased by a prominent family. She was enslaved for the rest of her life. Even so, she learned to read and write, becoming one of the most famous poets in her day. George Washington was a big fan, and she travelled to London with its future mayor and Ben Franklin.\nHer poetry covered many subjects, but one of her most famous is the one she wrote as an elegy to George Whitefield, ironically an evangelist that was a defender of chattel slavery. She wrote much about her faith and race as well. One of my favorites is On Being Brought from Africa to America:\n‘Twas mercy brought me from my Pagan land,\nTaught my benighted soul to understand\nThat there’s a God, that there’s a Saviour too:\nOnce I redemption neither sought nor knew.\nSome view our sable race with scornful eye,\n“Their colour is a diabolic die.”\nRemember, Christians, Negros, black as Cain,\nMay be refin’d, and join th’ angelic train.\n2. Jarena Lee\n(1783 – 1864)\nJarena Lee was born free in New Jersey, though she worked as a servant from an early age 60 miles away from her family – so she didn’t see them much. Lee believed in her own sinful nature before anyone taught her about it or before she knew the solution to it. When she was 20 years old, she attended a local Episcopalian church hoping to find an answer for her soul’s misery, but the segregated church made it clear to her that peace and hope lay elsewhere.\nShe found an AME church and within weeks was interrupting the sermon by exclaiming, “God, for Christ’s sake, had pardoned the sins of my soul.”\nJarena Lee went on to become the first Woman pastor in the AME church. She travelled, by foot, all over North America preaching the Gospel everywhere she went. She preached for 20 years and became a major part of the Second Great Awakening. In her autobiography she wrote about the time she heard a voice telling her to preach the Gospel:\n“Go preach the Gospel!” I immediately replied aloud, “No one will believe me.” Again I listened, and again the same voice seemed to say—“Preach the Gospel; I will put words in your mouth, and will turn your enemies to become your friends.”\n3. Betsey Stockton\n(1798 – 1865)\nBetsey Stockton had a series of unlikely events, rooted in the evil of slavery, that gave her incredible opportunities. She was a wedding gift from her master to his daughter. She happened to be marrying the president of Princeton University, and he couldn’t help but notice how bright and intelligent his new slave was. He helped educate her and freed her upon her conversion to Christianity. He was also an advocate as she pursued her calling as a missionary.\nStockton was the first American single woman to travel overseas as a missionary. She spent several years in Hawaii teaching them about Jesus. Once she returned to America, she helped found the First Presbyterian Church of Color at Princeton. She was also an educator for Black people through Princeton. Stockton broke many barriers and left a lasting impact in Hawaii and New Jersey as an emissary for Jesus.\nShe kept a journal about her time in Hawaii, and it’s full of her thoughts about and struggles with faith. Yet, no matter how despondent she was feeling, she found her rest in God.\nI always knew that the human heart was a sink of sin, and that mine was filled with it; but I did not know, until now, that the sink was without a bottom…He is still my Father and my God—and I still love him—Yes, my balm is still in Gilead, and my physician there.\n4. Amanda Berry Smith\n(1837 – 1915)\nAmanda Berry Smith was born a slave in Maryland, and became a Christian after having a dream when she was 20 years old. Her first husband joined the Union Army and never came home afterwards, though it’s not certain what happened. Amanda married again in 1865 with the hopes of becoming a minister’s wife, but he never reached that goal.\nWhen her second husband died in 1869, Amanda started singing and preaching at camp meetings and gained a reputation for being talented at both. She began traveling the world to preach the Gospel, going to India, England, and Liberia. She returned to America after nearly twenty years and opened an orphanage for Black children in Illinois. She left a lasting impact on each of the communities she lived with.\nWhen she thought about the dangerous journeys to Africa and India, Smith said,\nTo stay here and disobey God – I can’t afford to take the consequence. I would rather go and obey God than to stay here and know that I disobeyed.\n5. Mary McLeod Bethune\nThere’s not much that Mary McLeod Bethune didn’t do. She was born free, but was a sharecropper as a child. It’s said she could pick 250 pounds of a cotton each day by 9 years old. Pleasant attended Moody’s Missionary School, but she couldn’t find any churches to sponsor her as a missionary because she was Black. So she became an educator instead, and helped provide better opportunities for those that came after her.\nShe founded a boarding school for Black girls in 1904 which eventually became Bethune college. Bethune was also very active politically, even becoming close friends with Eleanor Roosevelt. She also served as the vice-president of the NAACP for 15 years. Bethune died before she could see the way her efforts would change America in the 60’s, but her impact cannot be denied.\nWhen she thought about the opportunities denied her, and how she wanted to make sure others had better fates, she reflected:\nI plunged into the job of creating something from nothing…Though I hadn’t a penny left, I considered cash money as the smallest part of my resources. I had faith in a living God, faith in myself, and a desire to serve.\nMany people who changed the world, including these women, in the past claim to have heard directly from God. Whether you find that hard to believe, encouraging, or somewhere in between, we have a podcast that you’ll love called “Audible God.”\nIt’s full of intriguing stories about ordinary people hearing from God.

But just as Pearl Harbor extended beyond Hawaii during World War II, it does so today as the world recognizes the red, white and blue sacrifice of “the greatest generation” of valiant troops who defended the USA. As Pearl Harbor’s echoes of war are honored in peace, here’s a look at some relevant monuments then and now.\nCurrent Pearl Harbor battleships pay tribute to those lost on December 7, 1941.\nWorld War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument\nWorld War II Peace Memorial on Attu Island.\nAmerican troops during the Battle of Attu attempt to reclaim the Aleutian island from Japanese invaders.\nFor the USA, World War II began at Pearl Harbor. But World War II’s Pacific valor memorials extend beyond Hawaii’s military outpost. The “World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument” actually comprises nine memorials in three western states—California, Alaska and Hawaii. One little-known memorial in Alaska commemorates the Battle of Attu in the Aleutian Islands—the USA’s only land combat against Japan on American soil. These battlefields and military installations were declared a National Historic Landmark in 1985. Two years later, the U.S. Department of the Interior and the Japanese government collaborated and officially placed the World War II Peace Memorial on Engineer Hill. Pearl Harbor, however, is home to five of the famous World War II valor memorials—the USS Arizona Memorial, the USS Oklahoma Memorial, the USS Utah Memorial, parts of Ford Island and Battleship Row. All nine memorials are run by the National Park Service, but Pearl Harbor’s sunken battleships remain under the U.S. Navy’s jurisdiction.\nUSS Arizona Memorial\nPearl Harbor’s USS Arizona was sunk 80 years ago. Architect Alfred Preis’s USS Arizona Memorial design represents the December 7, 1941 setback as well as the USA’s ultimate victory in World War II.\nThe USS Arizona Memorial is Hawaii’s biggest tourist attraction.\nThe USS Arizona Memorial was partially funded by an Elvis Presley benefit concert and dedicated by President John F. Kennedy in 1962.\nPearl Harbor’s most famous memorial salutes 1,177 sailors and Marines who perished in the December 7, 1941 attack (most are still entombed in the sunken battleship wreckage which is a gravesite). This National Historic Landmark was designed by Alfred Preis, an Austrian-born Jew and converted Catholic who escaped Nazi persecution only to become a later victim of the USA’s internment camp policy which detained and relocated thousands of Japanese, German and Italian-American citizens after the Pearl Harbor attack. Preis (who also conceived the Honolulu Zoo), designed the memorial’s low-slung bow shape to represent an initial battle defeat, perseverance, and ultimate war victory. Elvis Presley performed a benefit concert to raise funds for the memorial, which was dedicated by President John F. Kennedy in 1962. With more than 1.8 million visitors per year, the USS Arizona (which still leaks 9 quarts of fuel per day) is Hawaii’s biggest tourist attraction.\nSchofield Barracks suffered collateral damage during Japan’s attack on Pearl Harbor.\nTwo-thirds of the USA’s airfield fleet at Pearl Harbor was incapacitated by Japan’s surprise attack on December 7, 1941.\nOriginally built in 1909, Schofield Barracks is an army base designed to protect Pearl Harbor and the island of Oahu from attack. That barely happened 75 years ago as only a handful of U.S. counterattack airplanes took off. Imperial Japan’s December 1941 two-wave assault wiped out two-thirds of U.S. air defenses at adjacent Wheeler Airfield and inflicted collateral damage to soldier housing. Bullet holes from Japanese strafing are still visible, a grim reminder of the sacrifice and bravery of American forces. Today Schofield Barracks serves as command headquarters for United States Army Hawaii. Known today as the Tropic Lightning Division, it’s home to the 8th Theater Sustainment Command, 7,000 housing units, training facilities, firing ranges, and helicopter landing zones. It was also a prominent locale in the film From Here To Eternity.\nThe 441-acre Ford Island was front and center during the Pearl Harbor attack.\nThis island (originally called Mokuʻumeʻume by native Hawaiians) at Pearl Harbor could be called Flip Flop Island. The 441-acres of land has changed ownership hands faster than a hot luau torch (even King Kamehameha gifted it away)—serving as an ancient Hawaiian fertility ritual site, sugar plantation and eventually, a dredged military battleship station isle that became the epicenter of the Pearl Harbor attack. Among other duties, it currently serves as a tsunami warning station and it was featured in the films Tora Tora Tora! and Pearl Harbor.\nFord Island’s Chief Petty Officer Bungalows\nFord Island petty officer bungalow at Pearl Harbor.\nIn the 1920s and 1930s, the Navy built single-story wooden bungalows on Ford Island to house chief petty officers who worked on nearby battleships. Some were damaged during the Pearl Harbor attack, but ultimately, they survived (and housed officers until the 1990s). One historic bungalow succumbed to the wrecking ball of an overzealous contractor who inadvertently demolished it in 2015 as part of a renovation project. Oops. The National Park Service admitted its mistake—the demolition violated procedure as Hawaiian preservation authorities weren’t consulted beforehand as required. The bungalow was replaced with a replica residence."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:15eaf83d-5dfa-4889-b28f-1ffc0f434285>","<urn:uuid:7835bbbc-2422-4105-91ed-dcc5a64e5973>"],"error":null}

At first glance it does not seem possible that such a complex, curving form could have been folded from a single sheet of paper, and yet it was.\nThe construction is one of an astonishing collection of paper objects folded by Dr. David Huffman, a former professor of computer science at the University of California, Santa Cruz, and a pioneer in computational origami, an emerging field with an improbable name but surprisingly practical applications.\nDr. Huffman died in 1999, but on a recent afternoon his daughter Elise Huffman showed a visitor a sampling of her father's enigmatic models. In contrast to traditional origami, where all folds are straight, Dr. Huffman developed structures based around curved folds, many calling to mind seedpods and seashells. It is as if paper has been imbued with life.\nIn another innovative approach, Dr. Huffman explored structures composed of repeating three-dimensional units - chains of cubes and rhomboids, and complex tesselations of triangular, pentagonal and star-shaped blocks. From the outside, one model appears to be just a rolled-up sheet of paper, but looking down the tube reveals a miniature spiral staircase. All this has been achieved with no cuts or glue, the one classic origami rule that Dr. Huffman seemed inclined to obey.\nDerived from the Japanese ori, to fold, and gami, paper, origami has come a long way from cute little birds and decorative boxes. Mathematicians and scientists like Dr. Huffman have begun mapping the laws that underlie folding, converting words and concepts into algebraic rules. Computational origami, also known as technical folding, or origami sekkei, draws on fields that include computational geometry, number theory, coding theory and linear algebra. This weekend, paper folders from around the nation will gather at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York for the annual convention of Origami USA. At an adjacent conference on origami and education, Dr. Robert Lang, a leading computational origamist, will give a talk on mathematics and its application to origami design, including such real-world problems as folding airbags and space-based telescopes.\nDr. Lang, a laser physicist in Alamo, Calif., who trained at the California Institute of Technology, gave up that career 18 months ago to become a full-time folder. \"Some people are peculiarly susceptible to the charms of origami,\" he said, \"and somewhere along the way the ranks of the infected were joined by mathematicians.\" Dr. Lang is the author of a recent book on technical folding, \"Origami Design Secrets: Mathematical Methods for an Ancient Art.\"\nMost computational origamists are driven by sheer curiosity and the aesthetic pleasure of these structures, but their work is also finding application in fields like astronomy and protein folding, and even automobile safety. These days when Dr. Lang is not inventing new models using a specialized origami software package he has developed, he acts as an origami consultant. He has helped a German manufacturer design folding patterns for airbags and advised astronomers on how to fold up a huge flat-screen lens for a telescope based in space.\nDr. Lang has been studying Dr. Huffman's models and research notes, and is amazed at what he has found. Although Dr. Huffman is a legend in the tiny world of origami sekkei, few people have seen his work. During his life he published only one paper on the subject. Dr. Huffman worked on his foldings from the early 1970's, and over the years, said Dr. Lang, \"he anticipated a great deal of what other people have since rediscovered or are only now discovering. At least half of what he did is unlike anything I've seen.\"\nOne of Dr. Huffman's main interests was to calculate precisely what structures could be folded to avoid putting strain on the paper. Through his mathematics, he was trying to understand \"when you have multiple folds coming into a point, what is the relationship of the angles so the paper won't stretch or tear,'' said Dr. Michael Tanner, a former computer science colleague of Dr. Huffman who is now provost and vice chancellor for academic affairs at the University of Illinois in Chicago.\nWhat fascinated him above all else, Dr. Tanner said, \"was how the mathematics could become manifest in the paper. You'd think paper can't do that, but he'd say you just don't know paper well enough.\"\nOne of Dr. Huffman's discoveries was the critical \"pi condition.\" This says that if you have a point, or vertex, surrounded by four creases and you want the form to fold flat, then opposite angles around the vertex must sum to 180 degrees - or using the measure that mathematicians prefer, to pi radians. Others have rediscovered that condition, Dr. Lang said, and it has now generalized for more than four creases. In this case, whatever the number of creases, all alternate angles must sum to pi. How and under what conditions things can fold flat is a major concern in computational origami."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4d07b061-7da6-4469-8ff0-8da5de6316dd>","<urn:uuid:1b662ea3-7c51-489f-a754-af0f7c242d0b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Please compare the climate change benefits of green infrastructure versus wetlands.","answer":"Both green infrastructure and wetlands contribute to climate change mitigation in distinct ways. Green infrastructure helps communities adapt to climate change by increasing drainage system capacity for large storms, improving water supply system resilience during droughts, and mitigating urban heat island effects. It also reduces greenhouse gas levels in the atmosphere through urban vegetation. Wetlands specifically store up to 30% of the world's terrestrial carbon, making them crucial for climate change mitigation through carbon sequestration.","context":["Green infrastructure is a cost-effective and resilient approach to our water infrastructure needs that provides many community benefits.\nWater Quality and Quantity\nWater Quality: Stormwater from urban areas delivers many pollutants to our streams, lakes, and beaches - including pathogens, nutrients, sediment, and heavy metals. In cities with combined sewer systems, high stormwater flows can also send untreated sewage into our waters. By retaining rainfall from small storms, green infrastructure reduces stormwater discharges. Lower discharge volumes translate into reduced combined sewer overflows and lower pollutant loads. Green infrastructure also treats stormwater that is not retained.\nFlooding: Conventional stormwater infrastructure quickly drains stormwater to rivers and streams, increasing peak flows and flood risk. Green infrastructure can mitigate flood risk by slowing and reducing stormwater discharges.\nWater supply: Rainwater harvesting and infiltration-based practices increase the efficiency of our water supply system. Water collected in rainwater harvesting systems can be used for outdoor irrigation and some indoor uses and can significantly reduce municipal water use. Water infiltrated into the soil can recharge groundwater, an important source of water in the United States.\nPrivate and Public Cost Savings: When stormwater management systems are based on green infrastructure rather than gray infrastructure, developers often experience lower capital costs. These savings derive from lower costs for site grading, paving, and landscaping, and smaller or eliminated piping and detention facilities. In cities with combined sewer systems, green infrastructure controls may cost less than conventional controls, and green-gray approaches can reduce public expenditures on stormwater infrastructure.\nGround Level Ozone: Ground level ozone or smog, is created when nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) interact in the presence of heat and sunlight. Smog conditions are usually worst in the summer and can lead to respiratory health problems. Vegetation can reduce ground level ozone by reducing air temperatures, reducing power plant emissions associated with air conditioning, and removing air pollutants.\nParticulate Pollution: Particulate matter refers to the tiny bits of dust, chemicals, and metals suspended in the air we breathe. Because particulate matter is so small, it can enter into the lungs and cause serious health effects. Trees, parks, and other green infrastructure features can reduce particulate pollution by absorbing and filtering particulate matter.\nHealth Effects: Breathing ground level ozone and particulate pollution can cause respiratory ailments including chest pain, coughing, aggravation of asthma, and even premature death. In their triple bottom line study on the benefits of green infrastructure, the City of Philadelphia found that increased tree canopy would reduce ozone and particulate pollution levels enough to significantly reduce mortality, hospital admissions, and work loss days.\nEnergy and Climate Change\nUrban Heat Island: Urban heat islands form as cities replace natural land cover with dense concentrations of pavement, buildings, and other surfaces that absorb and retain heat. Trees, green roofs, and other green infrastructure features can cool urban areas by shading building surfaces, deflecting radiation from the sun, and releasing moisture into the atmosphere.\nEnergy Use: By reducing local temperatures and shading building surfaces, green infrastructure lessens the cooling and heating demand for buildings, reducing energy needs and decreasing emissions from power plants.\nClimate Change: As different parts of the country become drier, wetter, or hotter, green infrastructure can help communities adapt to climate change by increasing the capacity of drainage systems to handle large storms, increasing the resilience of water supply systems in times of drought, and mitigating the urban heat island effect. Urban vegetation can also mitigate climate change by reducing the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\nWater/Energy Nexus: Treating and moving drinking water and wastewater takes a lot of energy. By reducing stormwater inflow into sewer systems, recharging aquifers, and conserving water, green infrastructure can significantly reduce energy use.\nHabitat and Wildlife\nHabitat Improvement: Vegetation in the urban environment provides habitat for birds, mammals, amphibians, reptiles, and insects. Even small patches of vegetation such as green roofs can provide habitat for a variety of insects and birds. By reducing erosion and sedimentation, green infrastructure also improves habitat in small streams and washes.\nHabitat Connectivity: Large scale green infrastructure, such as parks and urban forests, also help to facilitate wildlife movement and connect wildlife populations between habitats. Learn how Loxahatchee, Florida is protecting the local watershed and conserving native ecosystems through the Loxahatchee Regional Greenways System.\nGreen jobs: Green infrastructure can reduce a community’s infrastructure costs, promote economic growth, and create construction and maintenance jobs. As demand for green infrastructure skills increases, a range of new training and certification programs has emerged.\nHealth Benefits: More green space and parks encourages outdoor physical activity, reducing obesity and preventing associated chronic diseases such as heart disease, high blood pressure, stroke, Type II diabetes, arthritis, and certain kinds of cancer.\nRecreation space: Green infrastructure’s vegetation and trees can increase publicly available recreation areas, allowing urban communities to enjoy greenery without leaving the city. Additionally, green infrastructure’s vegetation and permeable pavements can reduce noise pollution by damping traffic, train, or plane noise.\nProperty values: By utilizing green infrastructure in construction and increasing vegetation and tree cover, green infrastructure can increase property values","Removing Weirs and Restoring Wetlands Can Aid Ailing Rivers\nMar 23 2023\nRivers play a critical role in sustaining life on Earth. They support an array of ecosystems, from the fish and aquatic plants that inhabit them to the animals and humans that depend on them for drinking water, irrigation, and recreation. However, human activity has had a profound impact on rivers, from the construction of dams and weirs to the pollution of waterways. Some experts suggest that two effective means of river conservation are the removal of weirs and the restoration of wetlands.\nWeirs are structures built across rivers to manage water flow, often to provide hydroelectric power or for irrigation purposes. While weirs have benefits, they can also harm rivers by disrupting natural flows and impeding fish migration. Weirs also create artificial pools and alter the physical structure of rivers, which can have negative effects on water quality, habitat, and biodiversity.\nRemoving weirs can have a significant impact on river health. By restoring natural flows, rivers can regain their ecological functions, which include supporting fish populations and maintaining healthy habitats. For example, the River Chew in Somerset, UK, saw an improvement in its health after weirs were removed. The natural flow was restored, and connectivity for fish populations improved. This resulted in an increase in the number of fish species and individual fish, which in turn had a positive impact on the entire river ecosystem.\nFurthermore, removing weirs can also benefit recreational activities such as canoeing, kayaking, and fishing. Restoring the natural flow and habitat of the river provides a more diverse and exciting experience for water enthusiasts. This can have an economic benefit for local communities, as more people are likely to visit and spend money in the area.\nAnother approach to improve river health is the restoration of wetlands. Wetlands are highly productive ecosystems that provide many essential ecosystem services, including water purification, flood control, recreation, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity restoration. They play a critical role in supporting wildlife, particularly birds, fish, and insects.\nWetlands act as natural water filters by trapping pollutants and excess nutrients, preventing them from entering rivers and causing harmful algal blooms. They also help to regulate water flow, reducing the risk of floods and droughts. During heavy rainfalls, wetlands act as a sponge, absorbing excess water and releasing it slowly, reducing the impact of floods downstream.\nWetlands store up to 30% of the world's terrestrial carbon, making them essential in mitigating climate change. They are also essential habitats for biodiversity, supporting many plant and animal species. The restoration of wetlands can help to recreate or enhance habitats for species that have been lost due to human activities such as land-use change, pollution, and fragmentation.\nIn addition, wetlands can provide excellent recreational opportunities for the people who live nearby. Wetlands are great places for bird-watching, fishing, and other outdoor activities, which can have a positive impact on mental and physical health. This can result in economic benefits for local communities as well, as more people are likely to visit and spend money in the area.\nThe combination of removing weirs and restoring wetlands can have an even greater impact on river health. By restoring natural flows and habitats, rivers can regain their ecological functions and support a diverse range of plant and animal species. This, in turn, can have a positive impact on human communities that depend on rivers for drinking water, irrigation, and recreation.\nFurthermore, the restoration of wetlands can also help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, mitigate climate change, and provide economic benefits to local communities. The restoration of wetlands can also help to reduce the risk of flooding and droughts, making them an essential tool for water management.\nIn conclusion, removing weirs and restoring wetlands can have a significant impact on river health. By restoring natural flows and habitats, rivers can regain their ecological functions and support a diverse range of plant and animal species, as well as providing many essential ecosystem services. Wetlands are particularly important in this regard, as they help to purify water, regulate water flow, mitigate climate change, and support biodiversity. The restoration of wetlands can also provide excellent recreational opportunities for local communities, which can have positive impacts on mental and physical health.\nTherefore, it is essential to prioritize the removal of weirs and restoration of wetlands as part of river management strategies. This requires a collaborative effort between government agencies, local communities, and conservation organizations. Through careful planning and implementation, we can ensure that our rivers and wetlands are healthy, resilient, and sustainable for generations to come.\nIn This Edition STA Annual Guide - Read it Here Water/Wastewater - Continuous remote water quality monitoring networks Environmental Laboratory - The Important Role of ICP-MS in Unde...\nView all digital editions\nDec 03 2023 Budva, Montenegro\nDec 04 2023 Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia\nDec 12 2023 Nuremberg, Germany\nJan 17 2024 New Delhi, India\nJan 22 2024 Port of Spain, Trinidad"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9cb7dab0-7fea-445e-bbe3-af81dae72270>","<urn:uuid:8ec34fb6-d88a-4978-8fbc-ba8692526dfe>"],"error":null}
{"question":"I'm interested in sustainable farming methods. How does natural farming help maintain soil fertility compared to conventional agriculture?","answer":"Natural farming helps maintain soil fertility by using plant nutrient enhancers like Jeevamrut, Ghanjeevamrut, and Beejamrut, instead of synthetic fertilizers that can deplete soil fertility and disrupt soil ecology. These fermented concoctions contain various macro- and micro-nutrients and beneficial microorganisms like Azotobacter sp., Actinomycetes sp., and phosphate solubilizers, which help revitalize soil microflora and enhance soil fertility.","context":["Efficiency of plant nutrient enhancer for sustainable agriculture in diverse agro-ecosystem\nKeywords:Natural farming, plant nutrient enhancer (Jeevamrut, Ghanjeevamrut, Beejamrut)\nAgriculture is a dominant sector in India, thanks largely to the Green Revolution. Though it has enhanced agricultural production, productivity, and the country’s economy, long-term studies show that synthetic fertilizers and agrochemicals injudiciously deplete soil fertility and disrupt the soil ecology. In this context, a few traditional farming practices (such as Homa farming, Biodynamic farming, Agroecological farming, Permaculture, and Natural farming, under the umbrella of “Organic farming”) appear to be a viable alternative for resolving the majority of the problems associated with conventional input-intensive agriculture. Natural farming, in particular, is lately become a catchphrase amongst farmers, policymakers, and stakeholders. In its broadest meaning, natural farming is practicing agriculture that adheres to nature’s laws by considering the balance of natural biodiversity around the farm to ensure the least disruption to agroecology. The nutrient management in natural farming practice broadly revolves around the management of plant nutrient enhancers viz; Jeevamrut, Ghanjeevamrut and Beejamrut coupled with other components like Achchhadan (mulching), and mix cropping. Different farm-based fermented concoctions, named as Jeevamrut, Ghanjeevamrut and Beejamrut, are added to the soil or used to treat seeds to revitalize the soil microflora, and so to enhance soil fertility. The different studies revealed that nutritional and microbial analysis of the Jeevamrut exhibited the presence of different macro- and micro-nutrients and a large population of essential microbes including Azotobacter sp., Actinomycetes sp., and phosphate solubilizers. The microbial counts increased from its initial values with time as the incubation progressed. Different reviews have been reported for variations in the microbial counts (bacteria and fungi) as well as nutrient contents in the Jeevamrut prepared from different sources. Application methods of the Jeevamrut have also their impact on its efficiency. The solid form of the Jeevamrut, Ghanjeevamrut; also have great nutritional content and culturable microbial count compared to the Jeevamrut and FYM. The impact of application methods of a fermented concoction called Beejamrut, have also been varied for germination, vigor, and protection of seeds, seedlings, etc., from soil- and seed-borne pathogens, according to different studies.\nAulakh CS, Singh H, Walia SS, Phutela RP & Singh G. 2013.

{"question":"Could you explain why the Tang Dynasty declined, and how did their grain management policies differ from later dynasties?","answer":"The Tang Dynasty's decline began after their defeat at the Battle of Talas River in 751. Decades of military campaigns had drained society's resources, leading to significant revenue and productivity losses. This resulted in widespread civil unrest that the emperors failed to resolve, ultimately leading to the dynasty's collapse in 907. Regarding grain management, during the Tang period, there were instances where the government didn't pay for grain at all, which contrasts with later dynasties. For example, during the Qing period, while there was a formal handbook called Huangzheng zeli regulating government grain purchases and storage, the system was often abused with forced sales at unfair prices and manipulated measurement standards using different sized bushels for buying and selling.","context":["A Chinese cavalryman c. 1260 is shown firing on a Mongolian warrior. The huo qiang or fire lance, which may date back to the 10th century. It was essentially a hollow tube made from thick layers of I paper, inside which was put a charge of gunpowder and shrapnel pieces. When the huo qiang was lit, it blasted out a jet of flame and projectiles, the flames having an endurance of several seconds and reaching out to a range of 9ft (3m). In a sense, here was the earliest hand-held flamethrower.\nUnder both the Tang and Song (Sung) Dynasties (960-1279), China experienced widespread economic growth, which in turn gave birth to a Chinese golden age. This success was based upon the development of the agricultural potential of southern China, most significantly in the production of rice in the Yangtze (pinyin, Chang) River Valley. The future of China would now be determined by the link between the bureaucratic north and the agricultural south. To solidify this crucial relationship, the government constructed the Grand Canal, a magnificent civil engineering project that was, in its time, the largest human-made waterway in the world. The canal increased transportation throughout the country, both accelerating trade and creating a sense of unity. The maintenance and protection of the Grand Canal became a major focus of the Chinese military. In times of conflict, this waterway allowed the emperor to move troops swiftly to any trouble spot.\nWith China’s great economic success came a softening of Chinese society, widespread political corruption, and a series of weak and incompetent emperors who eventually sapped the energy of the empire. In particular, the effectiveness of both the bureaucracy and the military was decreased, helping to create the conditions for the Mongol conquests at the beginning of the thirteenth century. These nomadic warriors first entered China at the invitation of the declining Song Dynasty. The emperor hoped that they would engage and destroy the Jürcheds and the Jin (Chin), two northern nomadic tribes that threatened to invade China. In 1234 the Jin were defeated by a Sino-Mongolian military alliance, but then, in direct violation of that agreement, the Song attempted to occupy the newly conquered land and extend their empire into the northern territories. This action shattered the alliance and set in motion the Mongol conquest of China and the establishment of the Yuan Dynasty (1279-1368).\nThe Mongols would have a significant impact upon Chinese history. They established their capital at Beijing and abolished the bureaucracy based upon Confucianism and the examination system. These actions were taken specifically to negate the influence of the scholar gentry. The Mongols eventually adopted many aspects of Chinese culture and aggressively promoted its literature and art. Despite this openness, the Mongols were never able to find a solution to the Sino-Mongolian ethnic rivalry. Most of the intellectuals from the gentry class considered the Mongols to be uncouth barbarians. This ethnocentricity was exacerbated by the gentry’s resentment of the abolition of the state examination system, which blocked the gentry from gaining access to the highest levels of political power.\nAfter the death of Kublai Khan (1215-1294), the Yuan Dynasty fell into a period of decline. There were essentially four reasons that this took place. First, the southern region was occupied by a large number of activists who had remained loyal to the Song Dynasty. As the Yuan declined, many of these disenchanted groups were emboldened to take political action that eventually resulted in an empire-wide revolt. Second, Yuan military prestige also suffered a severe blow from two disastrous military expeditions against Japan in 1274 and 1280. Third, Yuan military failures were founded in the general weakness of the post-Kublai Khan government that was beset by deep-seated corruption within the political bureaucracy. By the middle of the fourteenth century, the Mongol government was far too weak to maintain its control over all of China. Fourth, the increase in peasant uprisings and the rise of secret revolutionary societies resulted in a series of disastrous insurrections that finally forced the Mongols to withdraw to their ancestral homeland.\nAfter he had secured the eastern border, the Tang emperor returned his attention toward the west. From 736 to 755 a series of successful campaigns extended the borders of the empire to the Pamir range, bringing the Tang to the frontier of Islamic civilization and placing these two great eighth century powers on a collision course. This Sino-Islamic crisis reached a flash point at the Battle of Talas River (751), a bloody confrontation that lasted for five days. The armies of Islam ultimately defeated the Chinese forces, ending Tang westward expansion.\nThis defeat marked the beginning of the Tang Dynasty’s decline. Decades of military campaigns had taken a toll on Chinese society, and the losses in both revenue and productivity were significant. These problems led to widespread civil unrest, which devastated Chinese society. For more than one hundred years, the emperors and their bureaucracies had failed to return the empire to a state of normalcy, and by 884 the Tang Dynasty was shattered.\nWith the final collapse of the Tang Empire in 907, China fell into a chaotic intermediate period referred to as the time of the Five Dynasties (907-960). None of the dynasties was able to unify China, and order was finally restored in 960, with the establishment of the Song. Most historians refer to the Song as the world’s first modern state, and its emperors were traditionally antimilitary. The government, in constant fear of an armed takeover, made strong efforts to limit the army’s power. The Song created a military model that placed their generals under the control of the civilian bureaucracy, resulting in the military’s lowered prestige and appeal for the aristocratic class. In time, the military came to be dominated by the lower echelons of Song society, and by the middle of the eleventh century enlisted men were receiving one-tenth of their former wages. This lowered pay caused great economic hardship, and mutinies became commonplace.\nThe Song government was faced with significant financial difficulties. The population of China had reached 140 million, and vast amounts of money had been set aside for the construction of large-scale irrigation projects. The empire had to import the vast majority of its cavalry horses, which also cost a considerable amount of money. China’s underfinanced military was grossly ill-equipped to meet the security challenges of the nomadic horsemen of central Asia. The Song bureaucracy responded to this problem by adopting a military philosophy based upon the concept of strategic defense. Money was allocated for the construction of massive fortifications that would frustrate the light horse cavalry tactics of the nomadic armies. The military theory that all defensive structures are eventually neutralized by an opposition force came to pass in the last years of the Song Dynasty. When the Song-Mongol military alliance broke down, the aggressive Mongol warriors quickly defeated the demoralized forces of the emperor and established the Yuan Dynasty. Between 1200 and 1405 the Mongols conquered Tibet, Russia, Iraq, Asia Minor, and southern and eastern Europe.\nBy the middle of the fourteenth century, the Yuan Dynasty began to decline. Years of famine gave rise to peasant unrest, and a secret religious sect known as the White Lotus spread anti-Yuan propaganda concerning the reestablishment of the Song Dynasty. In turn, the White Lotus also supported a peasant rebel organization known as the Red Turban movement. Fighting broke out between the Yuan forces in the south and the rebel armies. The success of these armies was primarily due to the fact that the Yuan had failed to keep the system of defensive walls under repair. The Yuan’s nomadic heritage and military success were based upon swift cavalry movements, and a defensive mindset was totally alien to them. Eventually, the Mongols were able to defeat the rebel armies, but they were never able to regain complete political control of southern China.\nFrom 1351 to 1368 the Mongols were involved in a series of military campaigns against Chinese forces in the south, in which they suffered a series of disastrous setbacks. The Mongols decided to abandon much of their territory and returned to their ancient homelands in the north. This strategic withdrawal marked the beginning of the Ming Dynasty (1368- 1644).\nThe new Ming emperor and his intellectual elite modeled themselves after the Song Dynasty. Like the Song the Ming adopted an isolationist policy that kept the government’s focus on protecting the homeland.","Pingdi 平糴 (also called hedi 和糴, tuizhi 推置, biaodi 俵糴, jundi 均糴, bodi 博糴, duidi 兌糴 or kuidi 括糴) and pingtiao 平糶 were two elements of an ancient system of grain price adjustment. In times of good harvest the local authorities purchased grain (pingdi) at favourable prices and stored it in public granaries, as a reserve for times of bad harvest, when the grain prices soared. Throwing the grain reserves on the market (pingtiao) during times of famine, the volume of grain on the markets was increased and its market price remained on an acceptable level.\nThis kind of economic policy was seen as a cornerstone of good government. It was promoted by Fan Li 范蠡, a counsellor to the king of Yue 越 during the Spring and Autumn period 春秋 (770-5th cent. BCE), and was also part of the legalist policy of Li Kui 李悝, the counsellor of Wei 魏 during the Warring States period 戰國 (5th cent.-221 BCE). Li Kui explained the high grain prices would harm the consumers, and low ones the producers. The government would therefore have to see to it that the grain price was balances into two directions. Fan Li defined the ideal price range as between 30 and 80 qian 錢, so that both, producers and consumers would benefit (nong mo ju li 農末俱利).\nLi Kui defined \"good\" and \"bad\" years were defined by certain criteria and ranked into three grades each (shangshu 上熟, zhongshu 中熟, xiashu 下熟, xiaoji 小饑, zhongji 中饑, daji 大饑). In times of excellent harvest (dashu 大熟), the government purchased three quarters of the surplus grain, in years of relatively good harvest (zhongshu) two thirds, and in times of good harvest half, and threw the respective amounts on the market in years of crop failure, namely half of the average individual yield in suboptimal years, three times in years of bad crop failure, and ten times when crop failure was disastrous. Li Kui's calculation are based on the assumption that the average yield of 100 mu 畝 (see weights and measures) of farmland was 150 shi 石 of grain. His data for the six levels of harvest were 600, 450, and 300 for good harvest, and 100, 70, and 30 for bad ones. Li Kui did not speak of a price range, but apparently aspired to keep the price stable on a normal level. Marxist historians therefore call Li Kui's policy a kind of control over the emerging class of grainbrokers, while Fan Li was had a more positive attitude towards these \"profiteers\". A similar procedure is mentioned by the master of interventionist economic policy, Guanzi 管子 (ch. Qingzhong 輕重篇).\nDuring the Han period 漢 (206 BCE-220 CE), Emperor Xuan 漢宣帝 (r. 74-49 BCE) adopted the suggestion of Geng Shouchang 耿壽昌 to build state granaries (changpingcang 常平倉) in the border regions, in order to supply the garrison troops there. The system remained a core part of economic policy until the end of the empire in 1912. It was also a component of the reforms in economic policy carried out during the Song period 宋 (960-1279) by Wang Anshi 王安石.\nDuring the Qing period 清 (1644-1911) a handbook for magistrates called Huangzheng zeli 荒政則例 regulated the purchase of grain by the government and its storage for bad times. Yet in practice, there was much abuse with the system. Peasants or grain brokers were forced to sell their grain at cutthroat prices, and grain purchases were measured by a large bushel (dadou 大斗), while the grain thrown on the markets was sold by the small bushel (xiaodou 小斗). During the Tang period 唐 (618-907) there were cases where the government did not pay at all, and during the Song period the government purchase of grain was by the peasantry perceived to be just a kind of additional tax.\nInformation on the early system can be found in the chapter on \"profiteers\" (129 Huozhi liezhuan 貨殖列傳) in the history book Shiji 史記 and the chapter on food and commodities (24 Shihuo zhi 食貨志) in the official dynastic history Hanshu 漢書·"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:62e88e81-ab3c-47e6-a281-0ce0e43ff49b>","<urn:uuid:1ccac1d8-1713-4db8-88da-aefa42a2d0c4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Hi, could you explain how modern salesmanship creates long-term customer relationships? Please include specific methods and principles.","answer":"Modern salesmanship creates long-term customer relationships by avoiding duplicate or fake products, not using pressure tactics or compulsion, and focusing on customer satisfaction. It wins buyer confidence through honest methods rather than misrepresentation or cheating. The approach involves understanding customer needs, providing quality products at reasonable prices, and offering solutions to customer problems. Modern salesmanship acts as an educative process, informing customers about products and their features while ensuring mutual benefit for both parties.","context":["“Salesmanship” is the art of winning hearts of consumers to dispose the firm’s products and services. It is the act of persuasion. It is the science of understanding of human instincts and paving the way to their fulfillment. It is the art of stressing the appropriate values of firm’ s products and services to fit the individual and varying needs of different buyers called on. It is the ability of a person to persuade the people to buy the goods and services for mutual gain namely, satisfaction to the buyer and profit to the seller. It is the art and science of serving the clientele. Following are some standard definitions on salesmanship:\nProfessor Stephenson deemed it as: “Salesmanship refers to the conscious efforts on the part of seller to induce a prospective buyer to purchase something that he had not really decided to buy, even if had thought of it favorably. It consists of persuading people to buy what you have for sale in making them want it, in helping to make up their minds.”\nIn the words of Mr. Garfield Blake, “Salesmanship consisting of winning the buyer’ this confidence for the seller’s house and goods, thereby winning regular and permanent customers.”\nAccording to Mr. Russel and Mr. Beach, “It is the ability to handle the people.”\nMr. William Carter defines it as “an attempt to induce the people to buy the goods.”\nEssentials of Salesmanship:-\nThe essentials of salesmanship are as follows:\n1. Mutual benefit\nThe price of the product or service must be reasonable for both the buyer and seller. As a matter of fact, salesmanship should benefit both the buyer and the seller. It is not the art of making a profit at the cost of the buyer. Salesmanship helps the buyer in obtaining the maximum return (satisfaction) for the money he spends and at the same time, it provides a reasonable profit to the seller. This is possible when price charged is higher than the cost and buyer gets qualitative goods at reasonable price.\n2. Salesmanship is a persuasion\nSalesmanship involves the ability to influence or persuade people. It is the art of persuasion not pressure, which is highly essential. In fact, persuasion is the soul of modern salesmanship. Modern salesmanship does not rely on pressure tactis or compulsion to force a sale.\n3. Creation of permanent customers\nModern salesmanship does not sell duplicate, fake products to customers. Cheating the customers by inferior, spoilt or unusable goods have no place in modern sales because it can never create a permanent customer. Rather, good salesmanship guides the customers in buying something which will give them utmost satisfaction.\n4. An educative process\nSalesmanship is an educative process. It educates people about their needs. Very often people are not aware of their needs or the way in which they could satisfy them. Salesmanship performs the function of educating the customers about their needs and their satisfaction. It also provides information about the products available, their special features, their utility in satisfying needs of customers.\n5. Winning of buyer confidence\nModern salesmanship does not use doubtful methods of influencing buyers. Misrepresentation, cheating, dishonest no place in modern salesmanship. There is not attempt to take undue advantage of the ignorance and innocence of buyers. On the contrary, modern salesmanship aims at winning the confidence of buyers by providing a solution to the buyers’ problems.\n6. Link between the buyer and the seller\nSalesmanship always acts as a link between two parties, the seller and the buyer, looks after the benefit of both the parties. It makes sure that the seller gets benefit (profit) as a result of the sale and the customer must also derive benefits by purchasing the product.\n7. A creative process\nSalesmanship is responsible for creation of demand through a problem solving approach. It starts with customer’s knowledge. It studies customers’ needs and problems and then suggests a solution to these. It demonstrates how the product or service can satisfy the need or solve the problem. Such an approach needs a lot of creativity, initiative and empathy.\n8. Aiming to serve producers, distributors and customers\nThe salesman helps the producer in disposing off his products at a profit. He creates demand for new products at a profit. He creates demand for new products. While for the distribution process smooth, easy and meaningful. For consumers, the salesman helps them to buy wisely.\n9. Discourages unnecessary arguments\nWhen prices are fixed; there is no scope for bargaining or unnecessary arguments. But customers argue when prices are not fixed. Therefore, in the process of salesmanship, care should be taken to avoid unnecessary bargaining with customers, because it leads to dissatisfaction. The aim of salesmanship should always be to build upon an empire of good will, but not to impair it by dissatisfying customers.\n10. Customers are always right\nSalesmanship should always give utmost important to the viewpoint of consumer and consider him as always right. A salesman should always look a purchase from buyer’s angle. Whenever a customer tells about the merits and demerits of goods, the salesman should give due regard to it. This is so because he pays the price uses the article and takes decision. He is in a better position than salesman. His knowledge regarding the product is practical. However, salesman should not accept any arbitrary statement blindly without protest."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:794a15c8-e60d-46c0-a7c1-e5b1b85aac40>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can you explain how Magnus Lindberg's Era connects to Sibelius' Symphony No. 4?","answer":"Lindberg's Era connects to Sibelius' Symphony No. 4 in two main ways: First, Era's opening sounds strikingly similar to Sibelius' Symphony No. 4, though with modified orchestration and denser harmonies. Second, Era incorporates a modified version of a brass motif found in Sibelius' work. However, Era's vibrancy and swirling gestures contrast with Sibelius' dark introspection and desolation.","context":["Plus de détails\n10.I-2014. Helsinki, Helsinki Music Center. Magnus Lindberg (b. 1958): Era. Felix Mendelssohn: Piano Concerto No. 1 in G minor, Op. 25. Jean Sibelius (1865-1957): Symphonies No. 6, Op. 104 and No. 7, Op. 105. Lindberg: Jubilees. Alice Sara Ott, Piano. Magnus Lindberg, Piano. Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, Hannu Lintu, conductor.\nFor the major Finnish orchestras, all the seven symphonies of Sibelius appear to be held in equal regard, as opposed to say nos. 2 and 5 which may be preferred over the others elsewhere in the world. This evening’s program featured the new music director of the Finnish RSO, Hannu Lintu, and his interpretation of Sibelius’ final two completed symphonies.\nThe program opened with Lindberg’s Era, a recent high-profile commission from the Concertgebouw and the Concertgebouw Orchestra. Inspired in part by the opening to Sibelius’ Symphony No. 4, the beginning of Era sounds strikingly similar to the Sibelius, with adjustments to the orchestration and denser harmonies. A brass motif found in the Sibelius is also heard in modified form in Era. Despite these similarities, the music’s vibrancy and swirling gestures, typical of Lindberg, was a major contrast to the dark introspection and even desolation found in the Sibelius. Also particularly striking was the clear influence of Scriabin in the work’s central section. The music works towards what appears to be a jubilant conclusion, but the final celebratory chord is subverted by a rather grinding tritone dissonance.\nComing after the Lindberg was a performance of the first piano concerto of Mendelssohn. The concerto demands little from the soloist other than sufficient technical proficiency, and this work appeared to pose few challenges for Ms. Ott. As an encore, Ms. Ott gave a sensitive and beautifully played account of Chopin’s Nocturne No. 20 in C-sharp minor, which was a far more appropriate vehicle for her musical and interpretive insights.\nThough occupying different expressive worlds, the fourth and sixth symphonies of Sibelius could be considered his most elusive. While the sixth symphony has a sunniness and vibrancy clearly absent in the fourth, the former possesses a subtle introversion which can keep listeners at a distance. Nevertheless, this evening’s performance of the sixth was one of the best I ever heard. One of the keys success here was Lintu ensuring a strong sense of flow, especially in the first movement. Special attention was given to the bass line, which provided a clear guide for the music’s harmonic movement. The mildly grinding dissonances, which threaten to subvert the music’s crystalline texture, were also brought to the fore. Finally, Lintu imbued the music with an appropriate restraint, especially in the symphony’s quiet and enigmatic close.\nLintu’s very broad account of Sibelius’ Symphony No. 7 could be considered controversial by some. This was particularly evident during the beautiful strings-only chorale heard shortly after the work’s opening, and in the first entrance of the trombone motto theme. While these tempos allowed one to savor Sibelius’ luminous harmonies and wonderfully slow-morphing middle voices, there was a risk of being pedantic and introducing a sense of tension which might not have been Sibelius’ intention.\nThe closing pages of the symphony were extremely effective, with yearning strings striving for the final destination (as opposed to fading away to a question mark in the sixth). When the trombone theme arrived for the last time, one got a true sense that Sibelius had reached the peak, and the sunset for one of the greatest symphonic cycles in the history of music had arrived.\nThe evening closed with a mini-recital of Lindberg performing his own set of piano miniatures, Jubilees. As Lindberg is usually considered as a composer of massive and densely scored orchestral works, Jubilees retains a sense of epic proportions while also being intimate and contemplative.\nCrédit photographique : © heikki tuuli"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"procedural"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"format_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:9b3e3821-caff-4620-b750-5d4c38bc3978>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Could you explain how textile dyeing techniques evolved in the ancient Middle East, and what were the traditional dyeing practices in Jordan specifically?","answer":"In ancient times, there is evidence of sophisticated textile dyeing from the 13th-10th centuries BCE in Israel's Timna region, involving cooking colorful plants in water and using alum as a fixative to create wash-resistant fabrics. The process used madder plant for red and woad plant for blue dyes. In Jordan's traditional practices, natural dyes were used until the 1920s, including indigo from the Jordan Valley, pomegranate, onion peel, mulberries, sumac berry for red, kermes insect for crimson, cochineal for pink, and yellowish soil. Salt, vinegar, or soda were added to make the colors permanent. Since the 1980s, traditional colors like deep reds, navy blues, greens, oranges, and blacks have been supplemented with brighter, chemically dyed colors to appeal to Western tastes.","context":["Tel Aviv University archaeologists have revealed that cloth samples found in the Israeli desert present the earliest evidence of plant-based textile dyeing in the region. They were found at a large-scale copper smelting site and a nearby temple in the copper ore district of Timna in Israel’s Arava desert and are estimated to date from the 13th-10th centuries BCE.\nThe wool and linen pieces shed light on a sophisticated textile industry and reveal details about a deeply hierarchical society dependent on long-distance trade to support its infrastructure in the unforgiving desert.\nThe study was published in PLOS ONE. It was led by Dr. Erez Ben-Yosef of TAU’s Department of Archaeology and Near Eastern Cultures and Dr. Naama Sukenik of the Israel Antiquities Authority; and conducted in collaboration with Vanessa Workman of TAU’s Department of Archaeology, Dr. Orit Shamir of the Israel Antiquities Authority and Dr. Zohar Amar, Dr. Alexander Varvak and Dr. David Iluz of Bar-Ilan University.\nTextiles suggest significant social stratification\n“This was clearly a formative period, with local kingdoms emerging and replacing Egyptian hegemony in Canaan,” Dr. Ben-Yosef said. “These beautiful masterpieces of weaving and dyeing — the first evidence of industrial dyeing at the time, of wash-resistant color on textile — support the idea of a strong, hierarchical Edomite Kingdom in Timna at the time.\n“It is apparent that there was a dominant elite in this society that took pains to dress according to their ‘class,’ and had the means to engage in long-distance trade to transport these textiles — and other materials and resources — to the desert.”\nThe research suggests a sophisticated dyeing process involving cooking colorful plants in water, then adding fleece fixed with alum to create a chemical bond between fabrics and dye. The result is a wash-resistant colorful fabric.\nThe researchers radiocarbon-dated the textile pieces and harnessed gas chromatography to identify the cloth’s organic molecules. They found “red” molecules produced from the madder plant and “blue” molecules from the woad plant.\n“Both plants were known in antiquity as sources of organic dyes,” said Dr. Ben-Yosef. “We know that these plants were used to create elaborate costumes during the Roman period, more than a thousand years later. Now we have evidence in the region of an Edomite society wearing textiles produced the same way, versus an earlier ‘primitive’ smearing of color on fabric.”\n“We can make many inferences according to this discovery,” Dr. Ben-Yosef continued. “To force a large group of people to work in dangerous mines in the desert, you need a strong ruling party — an elite that probably wore exquisite clothes to further distinguish themselves. The smelters, working in furnaces, were considered ‘magicians’ or even priests, and they probably wore fine clothing too. They represented the highest level of society, managing a sensitive and complex process to produce copper from rock.”\nEvidence of long-distance trade\nThe textile dye presents evidence of long-distance trade, Dr. Ben-Yosef noted. “Clearly this is not local. These plants require a lot of water and probably hail from the Mediterranean regions. The dyeing required special craftspeople, an entire industry that could not have subsisted in the desert. If Jerusalem was indeed opulent in the time of King Solomon, and the Temple covered in copper, we can assume a link to that kingdom.”\nThe textiles are currently being stored in special facilities at the Israel Antiquities Authority and will one day be presented in museums in Israel and elsewhere.","Unlike Syria, Palestine and Egypt, the trading history of Jordan mostly revolves around goods passing through rather than being produced; no city within the boundaries of modern Jordan has ever come close to matching the craftsmanship on display in the workshops and bazaars of Aleppo, Damascus, Jerusalem and Cairo.\nTraditionally, people in Jordan have simply made whatever they needed for themselves – carpets, jugs, jewellery – without their skills being noticed or valued by outside buyers. Today, although a handful of outlets around the country sell local (and some imported) crafts, Jordan has no Damascus-style craft bazaars. You may come across items of aesthetic value here and there, but your chances of picking up bargain antiques are very small, and any that you might come across almost certainly originate from outside Jordan. For the record, Jordanian law forbids the purchase of any item dating from before 1700.\nThere are only three rules of bargaining: first, never to start the process unless you want to buy; second, never, even in jest, to let a price pass your lips that you’re not prepared to pay; and third, never to lose your temper. However, the lack of a tradition of bazaar-style haggling results in a reluctance among Jordanian merchants even to embark on the process. In most everyday situations, you’ll rapidly be brought up short against an unbudgeable last price – which, unlike in the Cairo or Damascus bazaars, really is the last price, take it or leave it.\nEmbroidery and weaving\nThe field where Transjordanian people have the strongest tradition is in hand-embroidered textiles, although up to a few decades ago such fabrics tended to stay within the confines of the town producing them and generally never came onto the open market. Embroidered jackets, dresses and cushion covers are now available everywhere, in both traditional and modern styles, but relatively few are high-quality, handmade items.\nSheep’s wool and goat’s hair have been used since time immemorial to weave tents, carpets, rugs, cushions, even food-storage containers, for family use; the two fibres woven together form a waterproof barrier. Rarer camel hair went to make rugs. Up until the 1920s, natural dyes were always used: indigo (planted in the Jordan Valley), pomegranate, onion peel and mulberries were all common, as was the sumac berry (red), kermes insect dye (crimson), cochineal (pink), and even yellowish soil. Salt, vinegar or soda were added in order to make the colours fast.\nSince the 1980s, local and international development projects – Save The Children among them – have been involved in nurturing traditional bedouin weaving. By doing so, and by establishing retail outlets in Amman and elsewhere for the sale of woven items, they have managed to rejuvenate a dying craft, and simultaneously create extra sources of income for the weavers, who are almost without exception rural women. The quality of carpets, rugs and home furnishings produced under these various projects is first-rate, although prices are high as a result.\nThe older, more traditional colours – deep reds, navy blues, greens, oranges and blacks – as well as the traditional styles of stripes and diamonds, are being augmented these days by brighter, chemically dyed colours and more modern patterns, to appeal to a new, Western-inspired clientele, but there is usually a good range of traditional and modern pieces on offer. In Madaba, Jerash and Irbid you may see carpet shops featuring upright treadle looms; these are operated only by men, and almost exclusively in the cities, to produce mainly derivative items for sale. These have their own appeal, but the majority of traditionally designed woven pieces are made by women, who use only a flat ground loom, which they set up either in front of their home tent in springtime or at village workshops.\nA more affordable woven craft is weaving with straw, a skill of northern Jordanian women, to produce large multicoloured trays, mats, storage containers or wall-hangings. Baskets made of local bamboo, woven by men in Himmeh (aka Mukhaybeh) on the River Yarmouk, often find their way to Amman for sale in crafts centres.\nMany Jordanians have inherited their parents’ and grandparents’ preference – stemming partly from previous generations’ nomadic existence, and partly from a rural mistrust of urban institutions – for investing their money in jewellery rather than banks. Until recently, bedouin brides wore their personal wealth in silver jewellery, and retained the right throughout their married lives to do with it what they wanted, husbands’ wishes notwithstanding. Owning jewellery was – and still is – something of a safety net for women against the possibility of abandonment, divorce or widowhood.\nTraditionally, the bedouin much preferred silver to gold; indeed, it’s just about impossible to find genuine old gold in Jordan. The Gold Souk – a collection of tiny modern jewellery shops huddled together in Downtown Amman – has excellent prices, but almost everything is of generic modern design.\nIf you’re after more distinctive jewellery, you should be aware that, although there are a few Jordanian designers producing new, handmade items, practically all the new jewellery you’ll see in craft shops has been imported from Turkey, India or Italy. Chunky bedouin jewellery that looks old generally turns out to have been made seventy or eighty years ago, and much old “silver” is in fact a mix of eighty percent silver and twenty percent copper. Practically all the “old” necklaces you might see will have been strung recently on nylon thread using stones and silver beads from long-dispersed older originals.\nHowever, none of this detracts from the fact that beautiful and unique items are available; especially striking are necklaces that combine silver beads with beads of coloured glass, amber or semiprecious stones. Different stones have different significances: blue stones protect the wearer from the evil eye, white stones stimulate lactation during breastfeeding, and so on. You might also find rare Circassian enamelwork, dramatically adding to a silver bracelet or necklace’s charm. However, note that all precious stones in Jordan are imported, mostly from Turkey.\nMetalwork, wood and glass\nIn Amman, copper and brass items, such as distinctive long-spouted dalleh coffee-pots, candlesticks, embossed or inlaid platters and the like, are generally mass-produced Indian and Pakistani pieces. You might find original Yemeni or Iraqi curved silver daggers on sale, in amongst the reproductions.\nWood is a scarce resource in Jordan, and although you may discover some Jordanian-carved pieces (simple cooking implements, mostly, of local oak and pistachio) practically all the elegant wooden furniture you’ll come across – wardrobes, chairs, beautiful inlaid chests and the like – originates (and is much cheaper) in Syria. You might spot some original hand-carved wooden implements used in the bedouin coffee-making process, such as a mihbash, or grinder, and a mabradeh, an ornamented tray for cooling the coffee beans after roasting. Prices in Amman for olive-wood or mother-of-pearl pieces from Bethlehem or the famous blown glass of Hebron (formerly made in Na’ur, just outside Amman) can be half what you might pay in Jerusalem.Read More"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:4eaea9fb-3ad8-4c35-ac24-8c3cac27fa79>","<urn:uuid:54b65286-729e-4692-a1ec-551ab43897c9>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Can organs be harvested after someone is pronounced dead by traditional cardio-respiratory criteria? Please explain the different ways this can happen.","answer":"Yes, organs can be harvested after cardio-respiratory death through three main scenarios: 1) After classical cardio-respiratory death (spontaneous absence of heartbeat and respiration), 2) Through 'donation by cardiac death' (DCD) where life-support is intentionally turned off and doctors wait 5-10 minutes after the heart stops to confirm death, and 3) In cases of unsuccessful resuscitation where patients are brought to the hospital but cannot be revived. The organs that can be harvested vary by scenario - in uncontrolled cases like unsuccessful resuscitation, only kidneys can be used, while in controlled DCD cases, all organs except the heart can potentially be harvested.","context":["Using the Newly Dead\nAs a segue from the last posting on ethics and law in organ donation of the deceased, I want to bring to the attention to my visitors the full picture of the issues involved in the practice of “using the newly dead”. Are my visitors also aware that the newly dead are used for other medical purposes, in addition to organ procurement? Did you know about medical research and medical training to perform procedures?\nFirst, with regard to tissue and/or organ procurement, this is performed on patients who are pronounced dead by classical cardio-respiratory criteria (spontaneous absence of heart beat and respiration), they are also obtained from patients who are pronounced dead by neurologic criteria (absence of whole brain function including brain stem), so-called “brain dead”, and finally from those who are dead by cardio-respiratory criteria but which was the result of the voluntary and intentional turning off of all life-support and awaiting for the heartbeat and respiration to stop. This latter criteria is used for the “donation by cardiac death”(DCD). There is still concern by the public and also by some medical professionals about the ethics of procurement using death by neurologic criteria and the DCD mechanism of producing death. The concerns involved in “brain death” is that the heart is still beating and the patient is being ventilated up to and as the organs are being removed. The patient doesn’t seem “as dead” as with the classical criteria. The concerns about DCD is whether the patient has been observed long enough (usually 5 to 10 minutes) to be sure there is no spontaneous revival of heart function before the organs are removed. Since the intentional turning off of life-support in a patient, as a candidate for DCD. who is terminal or has no chance for any meaningful recovery, is done because of the previous autonomous request of the patient or on the substituted judgment of a legal surrogate or with approval of the family as being in the patient’s best interest, there usually is no controversy about this act itself. But there is concern about the “premature” removal of the organs.\nNow we come to another use of the newly dead. For years now, particularly since the advent of ventilator support and the concept of death by neurologic criteria, patients who are “brain dead” are being used for a great variety of research projects in which because the heart and respiration can be maintained for some time, the body can be functionally almost normal despite the absence of brain function. This means that medical research, though various techniques, can be performed on these newly dead which would be unethical or harmful if performed on live volunteers. For more details and examples of this use, you might want to read the Chicago SunTimes article “Ethical Frontier: Research on the Dead” by Jim Ritter in the Jan 3, 2006 issue. There are many ethical issues involve with this use. There have been various ethical guidelines set up by ethics groups to attempt to make sure that the research team follows certain ethical and legal standards. A discussion of the ethical considerations and the presentation of another, more recent, guideline is written in November 2005 issue of Nature Medicine by the multidisciplinary expert Consensus Panel on Research with the Recently Dead.\nRespect for the dead is an important moral point.“ Such respect requires that research with the dead abide by the deceased person’s life goals and treats his or her body in a dignified manner.” Other reasons for maintaining the dignity of the person is that “many living people have preferences about the disposition of their bodies after they die; an aversion to disrespectful treatment is commonly among them. Honoring such preferences after death expresses respect for the person who once lived and may prevent emotional distress among the living.” In addition this behavior with regard to honoring preferences may avoid mistrust by the living, without which might generate research opposition. Disrespect may also “cause family and friends anguish and feelings of guilt (for failing to protect a deceased loved one). Some points based on ethical concerns that are covered in the guideline is the need for the research to address an important clinical problem and there should be formal unbiased review by a research board before the research is started. In addition, amongst other points is that prior consent by the patient or surrogates is necessary and there should be confidentiality and an opportunity for health care workers who find the research against their moral values to have an opportunity to opt out.\nFinally, another use of the newly dead is that of the use for medical training of students, interns and residents to perform important potentially life-saving procedures such as endotracheal intubation or various other procedures which could cause harm in a living patient if they were performed improperly. To read more about the ethics of this use, go to Virtual Mentor. Prior consent is an ethical requirement, however there is literature which suggests that often prior consent is not obtained. If there is no consent from an advance directive by the patient, an argument that may be offered is that attempting to get such consent from a often distraught and grieving family at the last minute may not be in the family’s best interest.\nI hope that this posting gives my visitors some idea of what is being done with the newly dead in medical practice. Since all these uses are clearly done for the benefit of society and we may all have the opportunity to benefit from the results of them, I would be interested to read from my visitors what concerns they may have about the practices involved in organ procurement, medical research and medical training using the newly dead. ..Maurice.","HODS Rabbis & Physicians Seminar\nAlbert Einstein College of Medicine\n[Part 4: 13 minutes 58 seconds]\n|< Back to video page\nSo we talked about in this conference over the last two days brain death, what organs can be donated from a brain dead individual. An important dimension which you shouldn’t leave tonight without is appreciation of at least the notion of the donation after cardiac death. Some of the myths about donation after cardiac death and some of the real genuine ethical and halachik concerns about donation after cardiac death. So before the neurological criteria for death were established in the 1960’s and 70’s non- heart beating donation was the only source of cadaveric donation. This, many people don’t realize. So the, I forget when what the year of the Harvard criteria was, 68?\nSomeone from the crowd says 68\n68 was the Harvard criteria. So in the early 60’s and 70’s before that criteria became popular organ donation was occurring. It was occurring from cadaveric donation from non-heart beating donors. And the ethics committee of the society of critical care suggests that the required elements of, criteria for the cardiac-pulmonary death are simultaneous and irreversible. So what is cardiac death? I think we all know what cardiac death is; unresponsiveness, apnea, lack of breathing, and absent circulation. Which organs can be procured in donation after cardiac death? Now just to share with you, this is important, (that slide) in terms of terminology, the original terminology was non- heart beating donation the synonym for that has been replaced by donation after cardiac death which is called, like physicians are fond of putting acronyms to everything, it’s called DCD. So DCD refers to donation after cardiac death. Tissue donation, corneas, heart valves, skin and bone, has always been possible from non-heart beating donors. And I don’t suspect you discussed a lot about skin and bone donation, probably more focusing on the vital organs hearts, livers, lungs, and kidneys. You can see you can spend two days on one topic and still have a wealth of information that hasn’t been covered. Just gives you an idea of the complexity of the field of medical Halacha.\nMany centers have now established programs for kidney transplants from such donors, a few centers have also moved into non-heart beating donor liver and lung. This, I just want to share with you, this is called the restrict classification, I’m not fond of classifications in general but it’s very straightforward very simple. It tells you the different types of people that can donate after their hearts have stopped beating. And this is essential to differentiate between the very controversial ones and the completely uncontroversial ones and the completely non-halachically problematic ones. So the first one is when a patient is brought in dead from the outside. Somebody who has cardiac arrest outside may or may not have, actually in this case probably has had no resuscitation, successful resuscitation was not picked up by EMS simply presents to the hospital dead on arrival. Number 2, classification 2, is unsuccessful resuscitation. So somebody who is brought in by EMS doing chest compressions working on him for 10 15 minutes but the effort has been unsuccessful. Number 3, and this is perhaps the most controversial and the one that almost everybody identifies with this category of DCD and donation after cardiac death, is awaiting cardiac arrest. Now everyone in this room is awaiting cardiac arrest, shouldn’t be until 120 years. But what is the context here? The context here is, and Rabbi Flaum addressed this and one of the questions was asked about end of life issues and withdrawing of care he discussed the Shvut Yaakov and the Beis Yaakov. The issue here, the context here, are cases where a patient is either on, usually on life support but is not brain dead, no brain death here whatsoever just somebody who is very critically ill, and the family decides or the patient had expressed wishes that they want life support withdrawn. The expectation is, and the expectation isn’t always met, that once life support is withdrawn that patient will sustain complete brain and cardiac death, primarily cardiac death. So in the absence of removal of, this, of the respirator the person could continue for whatever period of time, but the family decided on Tuesday at 3:00 we will be removing the respirator, once we remove the respirator within a relatively short period of time the heart will stop beating, we will notify the transplant team that we are going to be removing the respirator at that time, the transplanting will be on standby. Once death is diagnosed as absence of heart beat, for whatever period of time they choose, then they will come in and transplant the heart. That is the most, one of the issues which is the most contentious and has evoked a lot of discussion in the medical ethical and lay population. Number 4 is cardiac arrest after brain stem death\nQuestion: is it successful?\nSo I’ll talk about how, what things can be successful, which organs can be successfully transplanted\nNumber 4 is cardiac arrest after brain stem death. So that’s a case where someone has sustained diagnosed 100% brain death then you remove the respirator from that person, and then their heart stops beating. And that, which may have come up in the discussion, gets something which Rav Shlomo Zalman discussed to some extent about the possibility of removing the respirator from a brain dead individual, allowing their heart to stop and then having the organs transplanted subsequently. There are debates about whether he rescinded or didn’t rescind to that. Be that as it may definitely something that was a theoretical possibility in the position of Rav Shlomo Zalman. In the 4th one which is a new category, cardiac arrest in a hospital inpatient. So that is somebody who is in the hospital for a variety of reasons but has, sustains a cardiac arrest in the hospital. So he’s in a medical environment where they can attend to him immediately after cardiac arrest.\nSo the reason why this whole category and topic is important is because the halachik organ donor society has 2 options; has an option of heart beating donation and non- heart beating donation. So what is that, what is the practical application of the non-heart beating donation part of that donor card? So obviously the applications are not as broad as the brain death criteria because brain death you can donate a whole host of organs which you may not necessarily be able to donate from a cardiac death. But in cardiac death there are still organs that can be donated, and lives that can be saved.\nCategories 1 and 2, so those that come from outside the hospital, are called uncontrolled donation\nCategories 3 to 5 are called the controlled donations. So only tissues can be taken from category 1 donors. So someone who is brought in dead from the hospital outside with no EMS, there’s nothing that can be donated from that person except tissues, which includes heart valves, bone, and skin.\nKidneys can be used from category 2 donors which is an unsuccessful resuscitation, which means if someone has a cardiac arrest rachmona litzlan (G-d forbid) at home gets an EMS comes you know shortly after the cardiac arrest and they brought him to the hospital with EMS performing resuscitation and it’s unsuccessful resuscitation and the person is diagnosed as cardiac dead in the emergency room, kidneys can be harvested from that person. So that’s an important thing even so if you don’t accept in theory the concept of brain death as halachik death there are still options which are not oft exercised, but options to serve as a donor as well. All organs except the heart can be potentially used from category 3, 4 and 5. So that means lungs, livers, kidneys, and heart, and I don’t know if this came up in discussion in medical discussion but for hearts it’s the shortest longevity time once they’re removed from the body, it’s only about 4 hours. So those still aren’t being transplanted. So these are guidelines which the UNOS has put forth; they say “it is ethically acceptable and appropriate to recover organs after cardiac death”. This is the important line, “the use of DCD donors presents certain risks in terms of the perceptions of the public and of health professionals”. And that’s the issue specifically of removing life support and then doing the organ transplant. “These risks are shared not only by the clinicians employing such protocols, but ultimately by the transplant system as well. Transplant professionals involved in DCD protocols must be sensitive to such issues and concerns.” So what are the halachik issues, and with this we’ll close…\nQuestion: What could be good for a heart, you said?\nRabbi: None, none of them are good for heart. Maybe…\nQuestion: But you said they call in a team and they say that at 2:00 they’re going to stop the, take the person off life support.\nRabbi: Oh yeah I’m sorry 3 can be good for heart, I apologize, right 3 can be good for all organs.\nAnother man: You said there’s a four hour\nRabbi: Yeah a 4 hour time limit. But even that, as well see in a…actually we won’t get to it but I’ll share with you briefly, hearts is debated whether they should use it because hearts need to be profused the longest. So people are very hesitant to harvest hearts even when they’re standing at the bedside and the patient is pronounced dead, and there’s a debate about whether the success rate from those is as good as a heart donation from a non-heart, from a brain dead donor.\nSo what are the halachik issues? So if the patient is brought in dead then you invoke the classic issues really similar to the autopsy issues, the famous Noda B’Yehuda and also the Chasam Sofer as well in this, whether you can violate the prohibitions and obligations that relate to the dead body in order to save a life, in order for פיקוח נפש (saving somebody’s life). So we have an obligation to burry, we have a prohibition desecrate, we have a prohibition to derive benefit from the body, but we have an obligation to save somebody’s life, so those you would engage in that discussion and that’s a relatively straightforward discussion which has been discussed for century upon century that for פיקוח נפש (save someone’s life) you could violate the body. Now you probably would want to do it in the least halachikally least offensive fashion, so have a surgeon very delicately remove the kidney and transplant the kidney, but it could theoretically be done. And I should hasten to add here I haven’t seen very specific discussions in the פוסקים (halachic deciders) about these issues so my halachic analysis is really a clarification of halachic issues. פוסקים (halachic deciders) have not discussed very extensively modern application of halachik donation after cardiac death. Unsuccessful resuscitation all the same, but the main issue is awaiting cardiac arrest; it’s these patients in whom life support has been removed voluntarily. And I’m actually just in the interest of time, I’ll, rather than read through these slides, I’ll just say one phrase for each one of these slides. The main issue is, well there’s two issues, one is would Halacha allow the treatment to be withdrawn? So if it’s a patient that’s a Jewish patient that observes the Halacha, would Halacha allow treatment to be withheld or withdrawn, the respirator to be removed? So the answer to that question is it obviously depends on the circumstance. In the overall majority of the cases life support generally or respirators generally are not removed. Rav Chaim David HaLevi, as Rabbi Flaum mentioned in his discussions, is famous for saying that one could remove a respirator. They are working in ארץ ישראל now to create respirators that have timers to facilitate the halachikally appropriate way to stop the respirator without physically removing the respirator and not necessarily have to reinstitute or reinitiate the respirator. So there could theoretically be circumstances where it would be halachically permissible to have a patient for whom life support or respirators could be removed and a surgeon could come in and do the transplantation. But what is the potential halachic problem? The problem is that to facilitate transplantation after the heart stops, the transplant community gives certain medicines or puts in or does certain procedures on the individual before they die, before they’re diagnosed as dead. So they’ll give them a medication called Heparin to stop from blood clots, they’ll give them, they’ll put in the big tube the big plastic tube into the arteries or vain so they can provide whatever fluids are needed. These things could potentially be halachically objectionable because they can, hast, theoretically hasten the death of the individual without being of any specific benefit to the individual. And just to close, this is a…2 more slides…this is showing the percentage of donation after cardiac death which has increased, it’s just the pink part, it’s increased from 1995 to 2004, so there’s definitely been a push and that’s because there simply aren’t enough organs being provided and there are thousands of people that are, 96 thousand people probably on the list currently and many people dying every day on that list so there’s been a big push to increase donation after cardiac death. And this is just an evaluation, as you said about whether hearts can be donated, it’s an ongoing analysis and assessment in the community about whether these organs are as viable and transplant as well and the success rate is as good, and like everything else in the world of medical Halacha it needs ongoing discussions with the physicians and the doctors which has been the objective of this wonderful conference over the last few days. And this is just one issue of a two day conference to give us a great appreciation of the complexity and the beauty of Halacha not only in its diversity but in its ability to approach the most interesting current up to date and complex topics in the world of science and Halacha. Thank you very much."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5ab20371-beff-4ca4-b154-bfe6ebdba244>","<urn:uuid:714151be-5573-48f8-82e9-9fe25055c97d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the specific financial and operational restrictions that come with an FTO designation in Mozambique?","answer":"The FTO designation imposes several key restrictions: It freezes any assets the organization holds in U.S. financial institutions, prohibits U.S. persons from engaging in any transactions with the designated group, and imposes immigration restrictions on organization members. However, these measures may have limited impact since ASWJ primarily operates in coastal Mozambique with few U.S. connections and relies mainly on looting supplies and profiting from the local illicit economy.","context":["Mozambique: The Problem with Foreign Terrorist Organization (FTO) Designations\nMarch 12, 2021\nOn March 10, the State Department announced the designation of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria-Mozambique (ISIS-Mozambique) and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria-Democratic Republic of the Congo (ISIS-DRC) as Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs) while also designating respective leaders of those organizations, Abu Yasir Hassan and Seka Musa Baluku, as Specially Designated Global Terrorists (SDGTs).\nIn the case of Mozambique, this decision is a response to the growing threat posed by Ahlu Sunna wa Jama (ASWJ), known as ISIS-Mozambique in U.S. government circles, which operates in Mozambique’s Cabo Delgado province. Violence escalated dramatically in 2020; the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED) reported more than 570 violent attacks, including attacks in Tanzania. There have been widespread allegations of human rights abuses by ASWJ, Mozambican forces, and private military contractors (PMCs) operating at the behest of the Mozambican government. The violence has led to the displacement of over 670,000 people, caused major food shortages and market disruptions, and led to a pervasive sense of insecurity. Nearly 700,000 people in Cabo Delgado are in need of some form of basic assistance.\nThe designation, while a seemingly straightforward and measured policy response to ASWJ’s brutality and its international terrorist links, risks impeding humanitarian efforts and hobbling potential disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration (DDR) activities. In addition, it is unlikely to significantly advance U.S. counterterrorism and counterinsurgency efforts. The implications of the designation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo are outside the scope of this article.\nQ1: What is ASWJ, and what is its link to the Islamic State?\nA1: ASWJ, or al-Shabaab, as it is more commonly known in Mozambique, first emerged as an armed group in October 2017 when it attacked three police stations in Mocimboa da Praia to free detained members of their group. Academic research indicates the group likely evolved from a religious sect that first appeared in Cabo Delgado in 2007 and has probably gained steam during the past three and a half years by leveraging social and economic grievances among Muslim youth living along the coast. The government’s heavy-handed approach to the conflict exacerbated these preexisting tensions, further fueling recruitment for the insurgency. ASWJ leaders have been modest in their use of media to broadcast their message, but in the few instances of published videos or meetings with local communities, they regularly condemn the central government for its mistreatment of the poor, particularly Muslims.\nPublicly available, reliable information on the exact nature of the relationship between ASWJ and the Islamic State is limited. ASWJ most likely makes its own operational and strategic decisions and does not act on orders from the Islamic State’s core. The target set and approach ASWJ has used to date is in line with its stated goal to remove the government; the group has consistently destroyed government buildings and infrastructure and has seized control of key roads and towns. The Islamic State and Islamic State Central Africa Providence (ISCAP) have periodically claimed credit for ASWJ operations through their media arms, but these claims at times lack specific detail and seem based on open-source information, suggesting communication between the groups may be irregular. ASWJ’s growing capacity and sophistication may reflect learning from the Islamic State—an interview of former Boko Haram fighters indicates the Islamic State provides training videos to its adherents—but the role of independent foreign fighters in advancing ASWJ’s skillset cannot be ruled out.\nQ2: What is the impact of this designation on the counterinsurgency effort?\nA2: Designating ASWJ as a foreign terrorist organization enables the U.S. government to freeze any assets the organization holds in financial institutions within the United States. It also prohibits U.S. persons from engaging in any transactions with the FTO and SDGTs and imposes immigration restrictions upon members of the organization. Academic studies suggest these designations are particularly effective when organizations are financed through charities and diaspora networks that are relatively easy to detect and isolate. Their effectiveness is reduced when organizations that primarily rely on criminal enterprises to finance their operations. Indeed, former director of national intelligence Jim Clapper has called FTO designations symbolic, recalling that he could not “think of a case where somehow that [designation] facilitated our ability to track them better.”\nFrom what is currently understood about the group, ASWJ does not have assets in the United States, and its members are unlikely to travel to the United States. As a group that operates in coastal Mozambique, its connections to the United States are limited. The insurgents rely on looting supplies and profiting from the thriving illicit economy in the region, enabling them to evade monitoring of the designation’s enforcement mechanisms. In addition, the United States, through the Authorization of Military Force, could tap into existing authorities to develop tailored programs to counter the group’s operations and degrade its capabilities.\nFinally, Maputo may view the designation as an affirmation of its narrative of an externally fomented conflict and may use it to validate the government’s emphasis on a military response to the insurgency. Mozambican officials last year started to stress the conflict’s external dimension, presumably seeking to deflect any blame for the region’s disaffection and mismanaging of the security response. A continued focus on a military campaign at the expense of social and economic programs to foster greater development and stability will likely prolong the conflict; a RAND study of post-World War II insurgencies shows that governments that rely on a heavy-handed approach have typically fared worse than those that employ a mixed approach to a conflict.\nQ3: What is the impact of this designation on humanitarian aid efforts?\nA3: The FTO and SDGT designations will increase the complexity of the humanitarian response. Moreover, there are already significant logistical and bureaucratic impediments, as well as pervasive insecurity, hampering the current effort.\n- Logistic Hurdles: Road access for humanitarian cargo in Cabo Delgado is limited due to poor infrastructure and climactic factors. Seasonal rains, along with the destructive impacts of a series of cyclones, have limited road transport options, making coordinated and effective response in the region complicated and expensive.\n- Bureaucratic Challenges: Humanitarian workers struggle with bureaucratic red tape. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs describes these as significant impediments on humanitarian efforts, with three-month delays in the approvals of visas and the customs clearance for emergency supplies taking upward of two months.\n- Security Concerns: In addition to ASWJ, humanitarian actors must navigate Mozambican forces and related PMCs, such as the Dyk Advisory Group (DAG). Humanitarian organizations have raised concerns about the inability to engage effectively with all parties to ensure safe passage for humanitarian goods and personnel.\nFTO and SDGT designations almost certainly will add further challenges, including by restricting the ability of humanitarian aid organizations to engage in essential dialogue with armed groups to receive security assurances. While nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) are not prohibited from speaking with designated groups, the broad definitions of material support create a legally challenging framework in which to carry out such dialogue. The “knowing” standard in the law compels organizations to carry out potentially dangerous vetting procedures, exposing them to physical risk if they are perceived to be working on behalf of states or governments deemed hostile to the designated groups. The ability of groups such as ASWJ to integrate into the civilian population also creates a legal gray area for NGOs to navigate in carrying out essential services. FTO and SDGT designations have elsewhere resulted in restrictions on access to financial services, as financial institutions are increasingly risk-averse to providing services in contexts with the presence of FTO and SDGTs.\nThe Biden administration should consider revoking this designation or at least immediately issue waivers or general licenses for humanitarian assistances. While U.S. policymakers may have assessed that a designation would have a limited impact in Cabo Delgado, where there is a small presence of international humanitarian organizations, ASWJ’s growing area of operations suggests that the designation could eventually pose problems. In the case of Yemen, the Biden administration revoked a similar designation at the behest of concerted efforts by the humanitarian community. Notably, in Yemen, the designation included general licenses for humanitarian organizations to carry out their work. This week’s announcement, however, has not yet been supplemented by clear guidance for organizations currently working—or hoping to work—in Cabo Delgado. It is imperative to address this shortcoming.\nQ4: How does this designation impact regional efforts at managing this crisis?\nA4: The FTO and SDGT designations also may hamper future international, regional, and Mozambican efforts to peacefully resolve the conflict. In addition to the United States, several of Mozambique’s external partners and neighbors are working to curb the insurgency. The U.S. designation has the potential to force their hands, retooling their engagement activities and issuing their own terrorist proscriptions. It may also prompt President Filipe Nyusi of Mozambique to reconsider his recent olive branch to the group when he dangled amnesty to individuals who break ties with ASWJ.\nThe designation also could complicate U.S. efforts to support eventual DDR activities in Mozambique. An FTO is not a showstopper, but it does impose additional steps. It is challenging to engage in most forms of communication or engagement with a listed FTO, even as part of peace processes or DDR programs. The secretary of state, therefore, is required to consult with the relevant congressional committees on appropriations prior to obligating any funds for these activities. In the case of Nigeria, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and the U.S. Embassy secured permission from Congress to use an appropriations rule enabling them to help the Nigerian military develop a DDR framework. However, as Saskia Brechenmacher explained in a 2019 Carnegie Endowment for International Peace report, the process was lengthy, and it was difficult for the United States to provide direct support because “assistance required time-consuming interagency coordination and vetting.”\nEmilia Columbo is a senior associate (non-resident) with the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) in Washington, D.C.

{"question":"How can I check if my bicycle chain needs replacement due to stretch?","answer":"You can check chain stretch using either a chain gauge or a ruler. With a ruler, place it above the chain with the zero mark at the center of one pin. Then look 12 pins down - this should align with an inch mark. If the center of the pin is more than 1/16th of an inch (about 1.58 mm) past the mark, consider replacing the chain. If it's more than 1/8th of an inch (about 3.17 mm), definitely replace it.","context":["A bicycle chain is the central component of the drivetrain, so it's important to replace it when it gets worn. There's no set mileage limit on bike chains, but there are several common indicators that it's time to replace a bike chain, the most important being stretch. Environmental factors also play a part in how often a cyclist needs to replace a bike chain. If the bike chain is particularly worn or you've has been riding the bike for a long time without maintaining the chain, it might be necessary to replace other components of the bike too.\nNo Set Mileage\nThere's a lot of dispute among cyclists as to how long a chain can last, but most agree that a well-maintained chain can last for at least 1,000 miles (about 1,609 km). The environment that bike is ridden in plays a large part in how long a chain can last too. Chains ridden in gritty or wet environments tend to wear out faster than others, though proper maintenance can make them last longer. You can usually get a good idea of how often you'll need to replace the chain on a bike by keeping a record of your mileage between replacements.\nOne of the main warning signs that it's time to replace a bike chain is that the chain starts to slip when you put pressure on the pedals. Other indicators that you might need to replace a bike chain may be sloppy or slow shifting; mis-shifts, in which the chain does not move into the gear you want it to shift to; or dropping the chain — which occurs when the chain skips off the front chainrings and lands either on the frame or off the far side of the crankset.\nChecking for Stretch\nIf your bike chain starts showing signs of wear, you should check the chain to see if it's stretched. This happens when the pins holding the links of the chain get worn down, which allows the links to stretch out further than they're supposed to. You can check this with a chain gauge or just with a ruler. To do this with a ruler, you should hold a ruler above the chain with the zero mark at the middle of one of the pins. Then look 12 pins down — on an imperial units ruler, this should line up with an inch mark. If the center of the pin is more than 1/16th of an inch (about 1.58 mm) past the mark, you should consider replacing the chain; and if it's more than 1/8th of an inch (about 3.17 mm), you should certainly replace it.\nReplacing Other Parts\nIf you've been riding the bike for a long time without checking the bike chain, or if the chain is particularly worn, you should also check on the other parts of the drivetrain to make sure they're still OK. If you put a new bike chain on a very worn drivetrain, you could still run into shifting problems. Since the gears and chain are supposed to work in unison, if you put a new chain on a worn down cassette or freewheel, then the new chain won't line up properly with the old cogs. Additionally, old cogs can wear out a new chain more quickly than it should.

Need clear instructions for game night.","answer":"To play the Cause and Effect Tree game: 1) Create a game board by drawing a tree with many branches or print a template. 2) Mount the board on a wall or flat surface and provide sticky notes and pencils. 3) Roll a die - highest number goes first. 4) Player One describes an event everyone knows about and writes it at the bottom of the tree. 5) Player Two adds a cause on a sticky note above it. 6) Player Three can either move Player Two's note to add an earlier cause, or add a co-contributing cause on the same branch. Players must explain their causes. The game continues until the board is full or players run out of ideas.","context":["The Cause and Effect Game\nKnowing more about cause and effect relationships play a big role in learning about history, literacy, math, science and even social interactions. Once your child has a better grasp on the idea that sometimes events happen as the culmination of a chain of causes and effects, and that sometimes an action or reaction can be both a cause and an effect, you can play a fun cause and effect game to reinforce his newly-learned skills.\nRelated ArticleTeaching Kids About Cause and Effect\nSkills Being Practiced:\n- identifying cause and effect relationships\n- understanding that sometimes events have multiple causes\n- sticky notes\nHow to Play the Cause and Effect Game:\n- Create your Cause and Effect Game Board either by print the above graphic or-- if you would like a larger, reusable version of the board-- by helping your child draw one. Use a pencil and a piece of poster board to draw a large tree with a lot of branches, each of which should have their own branches as offshoots. Color the game board as desired.\n- Tape or pin the Cause and Effect Tree to an easily accessible wall or set it in the middle of a flat playing surface. Provide each player with a pencil and place a pad of sticky notes next to the game board.\n- Roll the die. The player with the highest number goes first.\n- Player One begins by talking to all the players about an event or final effect. It can be the end result of science experiment, something that happened in a book, a historical event, the end of a movie, or something completely fictional. The only rule is that any book, movie, experiment or historical event Player One chooses has to be one that all the players have read, seen, participated in or learned about.\n- Once that has been determined, Player One writes the ending on a sticky note and sticks it on the bottom of the tree, or writes it in the \"What happened in the end?\" square on the printed gameboard. For example, he may write \"The Emancipation Proclamation was signed,\" or \"The carnations changed color.\" (See the Coloring Carnations Experiment for more information.)\n- Player Two then adds to the tree a cause for that effect. It can be a direct cause, in which case, he places his sticky note right above the “What happened?” square or a contributing cause. If he chooses a contributing cause, he places the sticky note in one of the higher branches of the tree (or writes it toward the top of the game board). He then needs to explain how what he wrote contributed to Player One’s end result.\n- Player Three now has a choice. He can move Player Two’s note up or down the tree if he can come up with something that occurred earlier in the chain of events and makes Player Two’s cause into an effect. Or, he can add a co-contributing cause on the same branch of the tree that Player Two used. Either way, he needs to explain his cause/effect and how it relates to the other notes on the board.\n- The game continues until the entire board is filled up or none of the players can think of any more information to add."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:23832002-bacb-43c7-9109-e7bec12c3e55>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Why were the defensive strategies at Fort Hindman and Port Hudson significantly different, and how did these differences affect their respective battles?","answer":"Fort Hindman and Port Hudson employed markedly different defensive strategies due to their geographical locations and preparation time. Fort Hindman was a square fortification with exterior parapets 100 yards in length, surrounded by a 20-foot wide, 8-foot deep ditch, and equipped with three heavy guns, four Parrott rifles, and four six-pound guns. In contrast, Port Hudson utilized natural advantages with 60-80 foot bluffs above the Mississippi River. The Confederate forces at Port Hudson had eight months to prepare, building earthworks atop ravines and creating obstacles by cutting down trees. Port Hudson's defenders also dug rat holes inside their earthworks for protection from Union artillery. These different approaches led to different outcomes - Fort Hindman fell after a brief battle, while Port Hudson's natural and man-made defenses enabled a much longer resistance, allowing the Confederate forces to withstand a 48-day siege despite being heavily outnumbered.","context":["Located on the Arkansas River near the site of Arkansas Post, Fort Hindman served as an important Confederate defensive fortification during the Civil War. Captured by a combined force of Federal troops and the Union navy, the fort was destroyed in 1863, and the site was eventually claimed by the river.\nOn September 28, 1862, Major General Theophilus Holmes ordered the construction of fortifications along the Arkansas and White rivers. The construction of these fortifications was in direct response to Federal movements on the Mississippi River and followed a Union fleet attacking a Confederate post at St. Charles (Arkansas County), located on the White River. Located about twenty-five miles above the mouth of the Arkansas River, Arkansas Post was selected as the site of one of these forts. The location selected placed the fort in a horseshoe bend that afforded the garrison a view of approximately one mile both upstream and downstream.\nLieutenant John Dunnington of the Confederate navy was placed in charge of the construction of the fort along with two civilian engineers, a company of sappers (combat engineers), impressed slaves, and Confederate troops providing additional labor. Work progressed quickly, and the main fortification was completed by late November. It was named for Major General Thomas C. Hindman, commander of the District of Arkansas and former commander of the Department of the Trans-Mississippi.\nThe fort was a square, with exterior parapets 100 yards in length. Surrounding the fort was a ditch, twenty feet wide and eight feet deep. A firing step for infantry ran the length of the interior walls, and two casemates were constructed in the fort, each housing a single gun. Three heavy guns defended the fort: two nine-inch columbiads and one eight-inch. The guns previously served on the CSS Pontchartrain, and thirty-five Confederate sailors, along with Dunnington, were transferred to the fort to operate the weapons. Four ten-pound Parrott rifles and four six-pound guns were also placed in the fort, resting on artillery platforms. Inside the fort perimeter were a well, two magazines, and three buildings. Outside of the fort, a line of trenches ran to the west for about 720 yards before it terminated at Post Bayou. Additional rifle pits were located to the northeast. A hospital opened in the nearby town of Arkansas Post, and winter quarters began to be constructed several hundred yards to the north of the fort.\nIn December, the garrison at the fort was increased, bringing the total number of units to three brigades of mixed infantry, cavalry, and dismounted cavalry, with some artillery support, for a total of 5,000 men. The troops hailed from Arkansas, Texas, and Louisiana and were joined by a new commander, Brigadier General Thomas James Churchill. A failed Union attempt to take the fort in late November and early December emboldened the Confederates, who captured the Federal transport Blue Wing the last week of December. The ship, which was carrying munitions and coal, was brought to the post and unloaded. This action brought the fort back to the attention of Union commanders, and a force under the command of Major General John McClernand embarked on a mission to neutralize Fort Hindman.\nWith a combined force of troops and naval vessels, the Federals arrived at a plantation near the fort on January 9, 1863, and launched a bombardment from the ironclads and other ships in the fleet the next afternoon. On January 11, McClernand launched a land attack after the navy had silenced all of the guns in the fort. Late that afternoon, the Confederates surrendered.\nAlmost 5,000 men were captured and shipped to prison camps in the north. The Federal force destroyed as much of the fort as possible before departing the area. The area saw no fighting for the remainder of the war.\nThe remains of Fort Hindman continued to stand alongside the Arkansas River for several years, but the entire structure had been taken by changes in the course of the stream by 1880. Some of the trenches still exist, but little else remains of the fort.

Washington DC: Government Printing Office, 1889.\nHenderson State University\nLast Updated: 11/24/2020","In 1863, Louisiana's river road was on the front lines of the Civil War. Union forces had already captured New Orleans and Baton Rouge, and were aiming to remove the last Confederate stronghold at Vicksburg. Rebel forces needed to control a larger section of the river, so they dug in at Port Hudson, Louisiana, the first high ground north of Baton Rouge.\nMichael Frairing with the Louisiana State Parks says, \"There were bluffs that were 60 to 80 feet above the surface of the Mississippi River. This gave the rebel defenders a distinct advantage over any Union gunboats that might attempt to attack or pass Port Hudson.\"\nHolding Port Hudson gave the rebels 150 miles of river south of Vicksburg to move supplies from the west across the Mississippi to the east. The first time U.S. Admiral David Farragut tried to run seven Union gunboats past the Confederate defenses at Port Hudson, only two made it. That prompted a major ground assault by Union General Nathaniel Banks.\nFrairing says, \"He had an army of about 30,000 men. Now the rebels here at Port Hudson, they were trying to protect an area of about four square miles with only 6,800 rebel soldiers.\"\nBut the Confederate forces had eight months to prepare. They built earthworks atop ravines, and cut down trees and created obstacles to stall Union troops. Union forces move in from the north and the south. In the first attack, 17,000 federal soldiers charged the rebel stronghold.\nFrairing says, \"And the federal attacks were not well coordinated, they were poorly led, and the Confederates just literally mowed down those federal soldiers.\"\nWith Union soldiers completely surrounding Port Hudson, the siege began.\nThe battle at Port Hudson lasted 48 days. That's one day longer that the Civil War siege upriver at Vicksburg, making this Louisiana battle the longest siege in American history.\nFrairing says, \"The Confederates did not have any reinforcements. They had to fight with what men they had. Every day that went by the Confederate ranks were reduced by casualties, whether killed or wounded, also sick.\"\nThe rebel soldiers dug rat holes inside their earthworks to shield themselves from Union artillery. There were constant skirmishes. After a battle, rebel troops would scavenge for guns and ammo from fallen enemy soldiers.\nFrairing says, \"Towards the end of the siege the rebels were reduced to eating horses, mules, dogs and rats.\"\nJoining the Union forces were the 1st and 3rd Louisiana Native Guard, a force of 1,000 black soldiers who were part of the assault on the rebel defenses.\nFrairing says, \"This was the first time in American military history where black soldiers as part of the regular U.S. Army made an attack.\"\nNearly three weeks after the siege began, Union forces launched another major assault. Again, they suffered heavy casualties and had to retreat. About 5,000 Federal troops were killed or wounded. Another 4,000 fell to disease. Confederates suffered 700 casualties and a few hundred more died of disease.\nFrairing says, \"There have been bigger battles, there have been bloodier battles. But Port Hudson goes down in Civil War history as the bloodiest battle per thousand men engaged during the Civil War.\"\nAfter Confederate forces at Vicksburg surrendered, the rebel soldiers at Port Hudson also laid down their weapons. The Union had won control of the Mississippi River.\nA national cemetery just outside the old Confederate defenses holds the graves of 4,000 Union soldiers who died fighting in the region. The Confederate dead were not allowed there. The grave markers are a reminder of the bloody siege and the human sacrifice that occurred on a strategic bend in the river at Port Hudson.\nThere will be battle re-enactments this weekend at the Port Hudson State Historic site near St. Francisville marking the 150th anniversary. Confederate and Federal re-enacting units will be on site all weekend demonstrating camp life and staging drills, skirmishes and the battle.

{"question":"Can you compare the roles and approaches of immunotherapy in treating advanced stages of kidney cancer and melanoma?","answer":"In advanced kidney cancer, immunotherapy focuses on newer approaches like cryoimmunotherapy and tumor vaccines combined with cytokines to stimulate the immune system in specific ways. For melanoma, immunotherapy includes multiple established options like monoclonal antibodies (specifically Ipilimumab), anti-cancer vaccines, and cytokines such as interferon-alpha and interleukin-2. Both cancers utilize immunotherapy to boost the body's immune response against cancer cells, though melanoma has more FDA-approved immunotherapy options specifically targeting proteins like CTLA-4.","context":["The treatment of renal cell carcinoma will depend on\nthe stage and the patient's overall physical health. If there is uncertainty\nas to management, a second opinion is always reasonable and can provide\ninformation to the patient to help make a decision.\nSurgery is the main treatment for renal cell carcinoma because\nit has the highest chance of cure. On the other hand, surgery is typically\nperformed in lower stage disease with the expectation that all tumor can\nbe removed. The most commonly performed surgery is called a radical\nnephrectomy. Radical nephrectomy removes not only the kidney but\nalso often the adrenal gland and fatty tissue around the kidney. Sometimes\na regional lymphadenectomy or removal of adjacent lymph nodes is also\nperformed. A newer procedure called a partial\nnephrectomy is becoming much more common, particularly with small\ntumors, so that only a portion of the kidney is removed. The patient is\nthen left with additional kidney tissue so that if another tumor were\nto arise, more renal tissue would still be available to the patient. Occasionally,\ndoctors consider arterial embolization, as these tumors can sometimes\nbe very vascular. The blood supply can then be occluded to these tumors\nand this maneuver may facilitate nephrectomy in select circumstances.\nThe risks associated with surgery include bleeding, later incisional hernia,\nor damage to other organs such as the spleen, pancreas, vena cava, bowel,\npneumothorax (collapsed lung requiring a chest tube).\nChemotherapy uses anti-cancer drugs typically given into a vein\nor by mouth which enter the bloodstream and reach all areas of the body.\nThis type of treatment is typically given when there has been spread of\ncancer. Unfortunately, kidney cancer tends to be very resistant to chemotherapy.\nWilms' tumor in children, however, is generally sensitive to chemotherapy\nbut the adult renal cell carcinoma typically is not. Chemotherapeutic\ndrugs can 0 cancer cells but they also damage normal cells. The damage\nto the normal cells may produce side effects which include upset stomach,\nvomiting, loss of appetite, loss of hair, sores in the mouth or vagina\nand an increase in infection, bleeding and infertility.\nRadiation therapy is also used to kill cancer cells but typically\nthis form of treatment is used more commonly when there is spread of tumor\nto bone. Sometimes if is also used if there is spread of cancer to the\nbrain. It is not typically used for primary treatment of the original\ncancer in the kidney.\nRESULTS OF TREATMENT\nIn stage I to II the overall survival rate is between 70 and 100%. In\nstage III, when there is more widespread disease, the survival rate can\nvary between 40 and 80%. In stage IV where there is spread of tumor clearly\naway from the kidney, the overall five year survival rate is in the 15\nto 18% range. After treatment, the patient\nwill need to be followed carefully with x-rays and blood tests. If there\nare new symptoms, then the patient should report them to the doctor immediately.\nOF TREATMENT IN KIDNEY CANCER AND KIDNEY CANCER RESEARCH\nThere are many new forms of diagnostic tests\nand treatment for kidney cancer. One of the genes causing clear cell\nrenal cell carcinoma has been identified on chromosome 3. Ultimately\nthis may improve diagnosis although it is not available on a widespread\nbasis at this time. There are constant improvements in imaging techniques\nwhich help doctors diagnose not only the main tumor but also potential\nspread of cancer. Undoubtedly in the future there will be improved\nblood tests to help monitor patients.\nMany advances have occurred in the surgical management of renal cell carcinoma.\nSmaller tumors are being managed by preserving a portion of the kidney.\nLaparoscopic crysurgery is a new, less invasive form of treatment\nthat freezes and destroys small kidney tumors without more extensive\nopen surgery. Patients can be rapidly discharged from the hospital\nand recover rapidly. Larger tumors, including tumors that extend\ninto the vena cava and into the heart, are now potentially surgically\nremovable, whereas before they were thought to be inoperable.\nMultidisciplinary team surgical resection. Using a combination of cardiac surgeons, vascular surgeons and urologists, we are now often able to remove tumors extending all the way into the heart, with quite good results.\n- New forms of immunotherapy/vaccines are also\nbeing developed along with investigation of new chemotherapeutic\nagents. The goal of immunotherapy is to boost the body's immune\nsystem to fight cancer cells. Compounds such as Interleukin 2 and\ngamma Interferon have been used to stimulate the body's immune system\nto fight these cancer cells. More recently, a new approach includes\ntumor vaccines. This approach involves adding activated genes or\ncytokines which can stimulate the body's immune system. Adding a\ncytokine to these vaccines is a form of gene therapy which hopefully\nWill stimulate the body's immune system in a very specific way to\nfight the patient's tumor. Because of the specificity of this %\ntreatment approach, there is less toxicity than occurs with many\nforms of chemotherapy. In the, future bad genes that are discovered\nin cells changing to cancer may be effectively combated by adding\nnormal genes into tumor cells to reverse their cancerous behavior.\nThese are examples of multiple new processes that are being investigated\nfor the treatment of renal cell carcinoma.\nCryoimmunotherapy is a new development for advanced kidney cancer, pioneered by Johns Hopkins (Drs. Rodriguez and Fuchs), and represents a very exciting new modality in development for patients with advanced disease not amenable to traditional treatment.","Immunotherapy for melanoma\nCancer may develop when the immune system breaks down or is not functioning properly. Immunotherapy (also called biological therapy and biotherapy) uses the immune system to fight cancer cells. Immunotherapy with melanoma is specified in order to stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells.\nTypes of immunotherapy include:\n- Monoclonal antibodies are artificial proteins of the immune system. Antibodies needed to fight off the cancer cells of a certain type, so they are used in the treatment of melanoma.\n- Anti-cancer vaccines. This type of immunotherapy designed to induce an immune response in the body against some diseases.\n- Non-specific immunotherapy. These treatments stimulate the immune system to work better. This method increases the activity of the fight against cancer.\nThroughout the treatment the doctors provided by integration services Oncology, including therapeutic nutrition, natural medicine, pain relief, rehabilitation after treatment. These methods may help reduce side effects and improve the overall quality of life during immunotherapy.\nPossible side effects\nImmunotherapy can cause various side effects, which include:\n- ulcers in the mouth;\n- high blood pressure;\n- the accumulation of fluid, usually in the legs.\nPatients with breast cancer may experience fever, chills, pain, weakness, vomiting, headaches and rash. Side effects of immunotherapy usually becomes less severe after the first procedure.\nDrugs of immunotherapy in melanoma\nSome medications, such as imiquimod or BCG vaccine, can boost the natural immune response of the body against cancer melanoma and can be applied or injected directly into the tumor of melanoma. Alpha interferon, interleukin-2 (IL-2) or Ipilimumab is used to treat some cases of late stage melanoma, and stimulate the immune system to attack abnormal cells.\nIpilimumab is a form of cancer immunotherapy approved by the FDA for the treatment of metastatic melanoma. Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody which targets CTLA-4, a protein that helps regulate the immune system by suppressing the activity of T-cells. This agent is used to treat melanoma that has spread or cannot be cured surgically.\nIn clinical trials, Ipilimumab, has helped some patients with metastatic melanoma live longer. However, this form of immunotherapy can also lead to serious side effects associated with the intestines, liver, hormones that produce glands, eyes, nerves, skin and other organs. The most common side effects from this drug include fatigue, diarrhea, skin rash and itching.\nCytokines for melanoma\nCytokines are proteins in the body that boost the immune system in General. Artificial versions of cytokines, such as interferon-alpha and interleukin-2 (IL-2) are used for patients with melanoma. They are used in the form of intravenous vaccinations. Some patients or caregivers can learn to do the injections under the skin, without leaving home. Both drugs can be given along with chemotherapeutic drugs for stage IV melanoma.\nSide effects of cytokines may include flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills, aches, severe fatigue, drowsiness and a decrease in the number of red blood cells. Interleukin-2, especially at high doses, can lead to increased fluid in the body thatleads to swelling and malaise."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:e1a3f169-4a20-40ca-8e4e-2af683c97e39>","<urn:uuid:8f72ccc5-5d2c-4f9f-a6de-41c53e1c3d9b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Why do inductors exhibit negative inductance above their self-resonant frequency, and how does this affect current-compensated choke design?","answer":"Above the self-resonant frequency (SRF), inductors appear to have negative inductance because they behave like capacitors due to parasitic capacitance between turns. At this point, the capacitive and inductive reactances are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign. When measured with impedance meters, this results in a negative inductance reading since capacitance can be interpreted as negative inductance mathematically. For current-compensated chokes, this behavior must be carefully managed. These chokes use opposing windings where load currents create canceling magnetic fluxes, allowing use of high-permeability ferrites for higher inductance. However, the parasitic capacitance still affects their high-frequency performance, requiring careful material selection based on the intended frequency range. Different ferrite materials like NiZn or MnZn are chosen to optimize performance across specific frequency bands while maintaining the current compensation effect.","context":["Prior Products - no longer available\nSoftrock Lite 6.2\nAdventures in Electronics and Radio\nElecraft K2 and K3 Transceivers\nFrequency of an Inductor\nWhy does my LCR meter say the choke has \"negative inductance\"?\n23 August 2009.

Although short\nand correct, a more detailed discussion may be useful to those encountering for\nthe first time the self-resonant frequency of an inductor.\nInductors, like all non-theoretical electrical parts, are\nnot perfect. The schematic below shows a commonly used model of a real inductor,\nof the type you might buy from a parts supplier or make from wire and a core. In\naddition to the inductance L, the real part also has loss (modeled as a simple\nresistance, shown in the model as R) and parasitic capacitance, shown as C. (It\nis also possible, and desirable under some circumstances, to model the circuit\nwith parallel resistance. For simplicity, our discussion will consider the\nseries model only.)\nThis model has been criticized as being overly simplistic,\nwith a more detailed model being proposed at\nFor the purpose of this discussion, however, the\ntraditional three-component model suffices. And, although the model shows R, L\nand C as \"ideal\" or theoretical components with no imperfections, in fact\nin a real inductor R, L and C are anything but constant, perfect components. For\nexample, the skin effect causes the winding resistance to increase with\nincreasing frequency and, in an air core inductor, L will also change with\nfrequency as the distribution of current within the wires changes due to\nproximity effect. If wound on a magnetic core, then the permeability of the core\nwill also have a frequency dependent component, which means L is a function of\nfrequency. And, the core will have a loss that is also frequency dependent,\nwhich means another factor that changes R with frequency.\nClassical model of a real inductor, consisting of\ninductance L, series resistance R and parasitic capacitance C. These values\nare not constant with frequency in the general case.\nCapacitance and Self-Resonant Frequency\nThe classical description of C is that it represents the\nturn-to-turn distributed capacitance of the inductor (and turn-to-core, etc.).\nAt some frequency, the \"self-resonant frequency\" or SRF, this turn-to-turn\ncapacitance resonates with the inductance L and the inductor becomes a parallel\nresonant tuned circuit.\nThis traditional viewpoint\nhas been challenged and the inductor analyzed as a transmission line, with the\nSRF frequency being determined as the frequency corresponding to the wire used\nin L being a half-wave long. David Knight, G3YNH, makes a very persuasive\nargument for this viewpoint at\nhttp://www.g3ynh.info/zdocs/magnetics/appendix/self-res.html and I recommend\nit to any interested in the subject. In fact, all of Dr. Knight's web site is\nworth detailed consideration. I have made some measurements of air wound\ninductors confirming G3YNH's SRF approach, and I hope to do more work in this\nregard before reaching a conclusion. I believe, however, his analysis is worthy\nof careful consideration.\nFor the purpose of measuring and describing a typical\nstore bought inductor, it makes little difference whether C is the turn-to-turn\ncapacitance or whether it is just a fictitious capacitance of a value computed\nbased on the SRF.\nImpedance Meter Determines Inductance\nFirst, we start by noting that modern laboratory-grade RLC\nmeters do not directly measure inductance or capacitance but rather measure\ncomplex impedance, i.e., R+jX or Z and θ. (In some cases, admittance, the\ninverse of impedance, is measured, but the concept is the same.) From the\ncomplex impedance, the instrument can compute the inductance L and loss factor\nQ, or capacitance and dissipation factor or the like.\nIf the instrument measures impedance in the form of Z and\nphase angle θ, for example, and if the instrument is set to display L and Q,\nthen it computes L as:\nL = X/ω\nQ = |X|/R\nwhere ω is the angular frequency in radians/sec or ω=2πf\nwhere f is the frequency in Hz.\nThe table below, extracted from the instruction manual for\nan HP 4192A impedance meter provides the formulas used for this conversion. The\nseries and parallel symbols in the top column rows indicate whether the 4192A is\nmaking a series parameter (impedance) or parallel (admittance) measurement.\nWhen considered in the rectangular or Cartesian form,\nimpedance Z = R +jX where:\nR is the resistance in\nX is the reactance in ohms\nj is square root of -1.\nX can be positive or negative. By convention, positive X\nis considered inductive reactance and negative X is considered capacitive\nOur formula for computing inductance, however, has no\nrequirement that it is valid only for X > 0. Hence, a circuit with a measured\nimpedance of, say, 100 -j100 ohms at an angular frequency of 1 radian/sec can\nequally be interpreted as being a resistor of 100 ohms in series with an\n-100 Henries or a capacitance of 0.01 Farads. Which is displayed depends on\nwhether the \"show L\" or \"show C\" function is selected on the instrument control\nOf course, the radio parts catalog does not show negative\nvalue inductors, but mathematically, at the measured frequency, an inductor with\na value of -100H behaves identically with a capacitor of value 0.01F.\nThree Element RLC\nModel Impedance versus Frequency\nReturning to the three-element inductor model, at frequencies below the SRF, the\nmodel appears to be inductive; at frequencies above the SRF it appears to be\ncapacitive and at the SRF it is resistive, as the inductive and capacitive\nreactance are equal in magnitude but opposite in sign and thus cancel.\nimpedance Z of the model inductor can be shown to be (in R+jX form):\nLet's look at two real inductors and see how they behaves when measured with\nan HP 4192A impedance meter.\nThe two inductors are both 1mH nominal value, a\n07MFG-102J shielded RF choke and a\nMiller) 5800-102.

It rises sharply around 1500 KHz and then abruptly switches to a large\nnegative value and declines.\nThis is the classical signature of a resonant circuit.\nAs resonance is approached from the low frequency side, the parallel resonant\ncircuit apparent inductance increases. This can be seen from the equation with a\nsmall bit of manipulation. (In order to avoid cluttering up this analysis with\neven more algebra, I've made a number of simplifying assumptions in the\nfollowing discussion.) At resonance the capacitive and inductive reactance\nare equal, so ω2LC = 1. But suppose we are at a\nlower frequency ω' such that ω' = XL = 1.1 XC.\nAt ω' therefore ω'2 LC = 1.1. Substituting ω'2 LC =\n1.1 into the equation for Z, we find (approximately) that L' ≈ 10L where\nL' is the apparent inductance or measured inductance computed from the Z\nmeasurement. Likewise, if we let ω' = XL = 0.9 XC (above\nresonance) we find L' ≈ -L/10.\nAt resonance, the capacitive and inductive reactance are equal, so\nω2LC = 1 and Z reduces to:\nZ = R/ωC -j/ωC. For the high Q case, j/ωC is negligible\nand Z is resistive with a value of R/ωC. In essence, the resistance is\n\"magnified\" by 1/ωC. (This is the principle of the Q-meter, after all.)\nThus we expect to see the apparent or measured L increase\nnear resonance, then reach zero at resonance (only a resistive component is\nmeasured at resonance) and then switch to a high negative value just above\nresonance, dropping with increasing frequency.\nIn order to estimate the distributed capacitance, it's handier to measure the\nimpedance in terms of Z and the associated phase angle, theta. At resonance,\ntheta is zero degrees, and it's usually easier to measure phase accurately than\nlook for an impedance peak.\n(In fact, there are three definitions for resonance in a parallel LRC\ncircuit. Fortunately for high Q, the definitions are numerically close, so we\ncan choose the phase = 0 version of resonance.)\nThe Fastron 07MFG-102 inductor displays a self-resonant frequency of 1575\nAt 100 KHz, far away from resonance, the measured inductance\nIf, and it's a major if, the inductance at 1575 KHz\nremains the same as measured at 100 KHz, we may compute the distributed\nω2 = 1/LC or\nC = 1/(2π*1.575X106)2*0.9856*10-3\n= 10.4 pF\nThis is a plausible value.\nWhether L is still around 1mH at 1.5 MHz is open to\nserious question, of course, as ferrites are dispersive, i.e., the\npermeability varies with frequency. Some ferrite materials exhibit a relatively\nconstant permeability with frequency, but the particulars of the ferrite used in\nthe 07MFG-102J are unidentified.\nMeasured Data - Bourns\n5800-102 RF Choke\nThe Bourns 5800-102 RF choke exhibits a slightly lower SRF, at 1277 KHz. Based\non a 100 KHz measured inductance of 1.008mH, the computed distributed\ncapacitance is 15.4 pF. This figure, of course, is subject to the same caution\nas in the 07MFG-102J case.\nCan an RF\nChoke be used above the SRF?\nA logical follow on question to these measurements is \"how\ncan an RF choke be used above its SRF\"?\nto this question should follow from examining the impedance magnitude versus\nfrequency in the plot below.\nOver the measured frequency range 100 KHz to 10 MHz, the\n07MFG-102J maintains a useful impedance. Below the SRF, the impedance is\ninductive and above the SRF it is capacitive. For many purposes, it matters not\nwhether the impedance is inductive or capacitive and hence the RF choke may be\nused without regard for parallel resonance due to distributed capacitance.\nAbove the SRF, it can be considered to be an odd type of\ncapacitor—one that conducts DC, but with a capacitive reactance that is useful\nin the same way an inductor is used, e.g. to isolate RF but allow DC to pass.\nThere are limits, of course, and as the frequency\nincreases above 10 MHz, the 07MFG-102J's impedance will drop further, which may\nbe an issue in some applications.\nAnd, there are applications where the circuit needs an\ninductive impedance so that operation above a choke's SRF is unsatisfactory.\nWhere a broadband, inductive choke is needed, it is\npossible to series connect several inductors so that at least one appears\ninductive over the frequency range in question. In this regard, ferrite beads\ncan be quite useful to extend the frequency range upward. Careful selection of\nthe ferrite bead will be necessary, however, if it is to provide useful\nimpedance in the low MHz range. A multi-aperture core will be useful in this\nfrequency range, if it can be found in the proper core material.\nIt's also possible to temper the large impedance and phase\nexcursions seen in these examples with a parallel resistor to work as a \"Q\nspoiler\" i.e., to intentionally add loss. The plot below shows the\neffects of adding a 1K ohm parallel resistor across the Bourns 5800-102 RF\nchoke. The impedance now varies less than 2:1 over the frequency range 100 KHz -\n10 MHz and the phase excursions are also reduced. The price paid is a lower\nimpedance than possible with the RF choke alone, of course. The Q-spoiler does\nnot alter the SRF nor the capacitive nature of the impedance above the SRF, but\nthere are occasions when an RF choke with a relatively flat frequency\ncharacteristic is desired. In those cases, a Q-spoiling resistor can be\nIt goes without saying, of course, that\nthe reason one does simply use the 1K resistor by itself is that the DC pass\ncharacteristic of the RF choke is preserved.\nSimple Three-Component Model Compared Against Measured 100uH Standard Inductor\nReturning to the question to the adequacy of a simple\ninductor model, I measured a standard inductor, Bellaire Electronics model\n103A-21 and computed the \"apparent\" inductance using a simple three element\nmodel. This inductor is a clone of the Boonton 103-series \"working inductors\"\napparently made under US government contract for the Department of Defense. Its\nWorking frequency: 800 KHz - 2000 KHz\nDistributed Capacitance: 6pF (marked 6µµF, of course.)\nApproximate Q: 200\nThe test fixture I used to connect the 103A-21 inductor to\nthe HP 4192A adds another 0.80pF, so the total parallel capacitance is 6.8 pF.\nFor the nameplate inductance of 100μH and 6.8pF distributed capacitance the\nself-resonant frequency may be calculated as 6.10 MHz.\nThe simplest inductor model is illustrated below. The\nmajor flaw in this simple model is the series resistance which I have based upon\na Q of 200 at 1 MHz. The series resistance will be the least constant of these\nthree parameters and may well increase by a factor of 10 or so from 100 KHz to\n10 MHz. Skin effect resistance is proportional to the square root of the\nfrequency, so over this 100:1 frequency range skin effect alone will account for\na 10-fold change in conductor resistance. In addition, the other loss elements\nlumped into the series resistor, such as the loss in the coil former, are not\nconstant over this wide frequency range. Still, we see that a very simple model\nwith these flaws provides a more than acceptable view of the inductor's\nModel for Bellaire Electronics 103A-21 standard inductor\nThe image below shows that over the 100 KHz - 10 MHz range, this simple\nthree-element model fits reasonably well to the measured data.\nLooking in greater detail at the critical range around the\nself-resonant frequency (which we compute at 6.1 MHz), the three element model\nshows quite decent fit to the measured data. The main divergence is related to\nour simplistic fixed resistance loss.\nBy adjusting the series resistance to 50 Ohms, we can\nmake the simple model fit the measured data almost perfectly over the frequency\nrange 5000-7000 KHz. In fact what we need is a model in which R is a function of\nfrequency, but even the simple fixed R model works surprisingly well over a\nlimited frequency range when it comes to predicting the apparent inductance, as\nmeasured by an impedance-based instrument.","Coils wound on toroids have due to the closed magnetic circuit, a high inductance and thus a good attenuation effect. If they are connected into a mains network in order to block or suppress interference of any frequency the choice of inductor must be determined by the kind of interference that applies. This article discuss construction and its impact of toroidal inductors, current compensated chokes, common mode chokes and beads.\nWe have to deal with either common mode / asymmetrical interference or differential mode / symmetrical interference.\nIf we have a noise or interference source in a network that produces interference currents via short circuiting parasitic capacitance in, for example, the load, the two interference types may be illustrated with Figure 1.\nThe cure for this kind of interference current might be use of chokes combined with X- and Y- safety capacitors, i.e., capacitors intended for interference suppression in the mains. Asymmetrical interference is best rectified by a so called current compensated choke, where two counteracting windings cause the load current to create two opposing magnet fluxes. Those two fluxes cancel each other out. Any saturation risk is out of the question.\nThis method allows high permeability ferrites and subsequent high inductance. For asymmetric interference signals the inductance of the two windings co-operate and produce approximately 3.5 times higher inductance than a separate winding.\nNote that the opposing fluxes from the load current create certain magnetic stray fluxes around the coils. This is illustrated in following figure 3.\nWhen there is a symmetrical interference (Figure 4.) we can’t use a current compensated choke. The fluxes of the load and interference currents will co-operate inside the toroid. In order not to come near magnetic saturation ferrites, with low to medium high permeability have to be used.\nCurrent Compensated Chokes\nSaturation effects caused by high signal currents, or DC current super imposed on the signal, reduce the effectiveness of the choke. The use of standard inductors in the signal path adversely impairs the useful signal. Current compensation circumvents these disadvantages. In current compensation, the “useful return current” must be passed through the choke. In this way, the useful current does not contribute to the magnetization of the core. See Figures 2. and 5.\nCurrent-compensated chokes can be manufactured with different ferrite geometries; the best known are toroidal ring core and ribbed core. Different core materials enable their use in various frequency ranges. A very well known component, but one not designed as a common mode choke, is the snap ferrite or the split ferrite sleeve.\nThe effect of current-compensated chokes on coupled interference is, above all, used for data and signal lines. They are often the only option to avoid the interference suppression component affecting the useful signal.\nCurrent Compensated Choke Types\nThere is a wide range of current compensated choke types. Here is an overview of the most common types.\nSMD Common Mode Noise Suppressor\nThe SMD Common Mode Noise Suppressor is usually not based on a ring core, either in size 0805 or 1206. Only for this reason it is possible to achieve such a compact current-compensated component. However, as it is a closed ferrite material system, the stray field remains negligibly small. Typical applications for the SMD common mode noise suppressors are USB, Firewire or High Speed Data Lines.\nCurrent-Compensated SMD filter\nIn contrast to SMD common mode noise suppressors, the current-compensated SMD line filters include ring cores. As a result, stray fields can almost be excluded. The different geometries and, above all, the very flat package heights of the various types, offer potential solutions for every application. High current ratings, as used in low-voltage applications, are also available.\nDespite their compact construction, the current-compensated SMD line filters can also offers 4x current-compensated versions.\nNiZn Core Current-Compensated SMD Filter\nThe NiZn current-compensated SMD line filters offers high in common mode impedance with a smaller footprint than MnZn types. NiZn ferrite base material provides a wider working temperature range.\nAt the same time, the leakage inductance is lower so the signal is less affected. The NiZn core current-compensated SMD line filters can therefore also be used at high signal frequencies.\nMnZn Current-Compensated SMD Filter\nThe MnZn current-compensated SMD line filter (such as Würth Elektronik WE-SL1 series) all excels by virtue of its low space requirement, both in terms of package height as well as footprint.\nThe manganese-zinc basic material provides adequate balances attenuation values.\nMnZn Current-Compensated SMD Filter with Separated Construction\nThe MnZn current-compensated SMD line filters can be prepared also with separated construction and both sectional and bifilar winding technology.\nThe separated construction of the sectional winding allows both the attenuation of high frequency symmetrical frequency components, as well as the suppression of asymmetrical interference components. However, if the quality of the useful signal is too greatly affected, the original bifilar winding technology should be chosen.\nHigh Density MnZn Current-Compensated SMD filter with Separated Construction\nThe MnZn current-compensated SMD line filter with separated construction can be also made in high density version that represents an advancement of the MnZn current-compensated SMD line filters. Despite the halved package height, almost the same performance can be attained, at least for low inductance values. Additionally a 3x current-compensated version has been developed, which is mainly used for low voltages.\nHigh Frequency MnZn Current-Compensated SMD Filter\nA special high frequency design of manganese-zinc allows the frequency band in the single and double figure megahertz range to be covered.\nCurrent Compensated Choke for Mains Voltage Applications\nSpecial construction of the current-compensated chokes allow the reduction of undesirable parasitic effects. Careful selection of core/winding relationship allows a very high current for a comparable footprint.\nHowever, if conducting components or packaging parts are placed in the immediate vicinity, the required safety separation must be ensured on some types, as enameled wires are not considered to be insulated components. In most cases, the use of this design, however, unproblematic as insulated components, such as capacitors, provide the necessary separation.\nMulti-chamber Current-Compensated Power Line Chokes\nMultichamber current-compensated choke has roughly twice the leakage inductance relative to comparable toroidal chokes. The effect on symmetrical interference increases without having to use an additional inductor. Parasitic parallel capacitance is reduced as a result of the construction with a multi-chamber coil body.\nThe impedance profile is raised at higher frequencies. At the same time, resilience against burst and surge pulses is improved.\nA special variant of the toroidal inductor is the so called attenuation bead that becomes effective in the MHz range. It consists in its most simple form of a miniature toroid in low or high permeability ferrite or sometimes of iron powder. In alternative designs the “bead” becomes a tube or, depending on application, a double or multiaperture ferrite core. In all these variants the lead passes through the toroid. In designs where all space in the construction is consumed and we find afterwards that interference suppression measures are needed a small ferrite bead may be the solution.\nIt increases the inductance of the lead/wire in the RF range and functions as an energy absorber, for example, transients. A simple formula for estimating the induction factor AL of the bead is Equation  below.\nAL= µ x 0.4π/c » µ x 0.2 x h x ln(D/d) \nh is height, D is outer diameter, d is inner diameter of the toroid, The measures are expressed in mm.\nExample: µ = 750, h = 2.5 mm, D = 6.3mm, d=3.8 mm gives AL = 750 x 0.2 x 2.5 x ln(6.3/3.8) = 190 nH.\nFerrite beads also are manufactured as chips. Examples of ferrite chip characteristics of two different materials are stated in the following table 1.\nNote how the flux density B has been reduced considerably at 100 °C, though the Curie temperature TC is situated considerably higher. How the different materials may depend on frequency is shown in following diagram.\nNote how lower permeabilities improve the impedance at higher frequencies as well as how DC load, increasing the flux density B, lowers the impedance. In order to cover a broader frequency band it might be necessary to connect in series ferrite beads with different materials.\nFinally we should observe that ferrites have a certain conductance. In sensitive applications it might be necessary to use isolated/lacquered beads."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_inference"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:8926e9eb-1db8-43a3-8f18-76e0f1b8c683>","<urn:uuid:2a2cde69-a4a1-4292-a7fd-7540cb6b4c24>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Why is Puerto Montt considered an important Chilean port? Need facts about its location.","answer":"Puerto Montt is a significant Chilean port that provides access to multiple key regions: the lakes region, Chile's fjords, and the large island of Chiloé. While it serves as an industrial workhorse for Chile, it's also known for its gorgeous coastline and traditional seafood restaurants in the Angelmó market area, where they serve local specialties like fried reineta and caldillo de congrio.","context":["Visiting the southern hemisphere in December, January and February is a great way to get away from the colder temperatures (and snow) back home up in the United States. And while Patagonia generally has cool temperatures, and the coast is breezy and cool much of the year, it can get pretty warm in Santiago. Here are a few ways to cool off if the change proves to be a bit more than you expected.\nCerro San Cristobal, the large hill that overlooks much of Santiago, Chile, is many things to many people. It’s a spot for religious pilgrimage, visiting the 22-meter marble statue of Mary atop the hill, or the small chapel nearby. It’s a proving ground for cyclists and runners, who use the hill’s smooth asphalt to train. And it’s a spot for family outings and photo-ops, atop the hill at Plaza Tupahue, where several vendors sell mote con huesillo, a local (nonalcoholic) drink made of reconstituted peaches and wheat kernels.\nHow you get up the 300-meter hill is up to you. If you’ve got a bit of time and energy, maybe you’d like to walk. A little less time but more energy, maybe a bike rental is for you. Or if not, there are a couple of motorized options listed below.\nBringing your kids traveling is a great opportunity to spend some family time together. With schedules changed, the family in (usually) closer proximity, and favorite pastimes left at home, it’s the perfect time to explore the food and culture of a whole new place. And when that place is Santiago, Chile, there are many choices that are great for families. If you want to be nearly assured of a good day, make sure to pack in some kid-specific activities like those listed below.\nPhoto: Robert Couse-Baker\nOne of the joys of traveling is trying out local tastes and traditions. Chile has many main dishes and drinks both alcoholic and non-alcoholic that are part and parcel of summer. For example, the stewy potage of porotos granados, with corn, squash and beans is typical of summer, as those ingredients come in to season. Mote con huesillo, the sweet peach punch with wheat kernels and reconstituted, dried peaches, and cola de mono, a sweet café-con-leche concoction made with pisco are also popular at this time of year. But if you want to get a little more basic, head to the markets (or supermarket) and check out some of the fruit that comes into season as if to remind us that the long days of summer are just ahead.\nPhoto: Leandro's World Tour\nOne of the main reasons we travel is to try foods from other countries. Coincidentally, all that sight seeing, museum hopping, checking out parks, long walks, photography tours and all the rest can leave you hungry as well. The main meal in Chile is often eaten at lunchtime, and there’s no better place than the few blocks surrounding the Cal y Canto Metro/Estación Mapocho in Santiago to see what’s on people’s plates come noon (or two, the preferred lunchtime). If you’re feeling peckish, here are three markets, all within a few blocks of each other for you to try.\nPuerto Montt, one of the most important ports in Chile, has a gorgeous coastline, and great access to both the lakes region and journeys through the fjords of Chile as well as the large island of Chiloé. As a port town, it’s mainly a workhorse for Chile, and you can see this reflected in some of the industrial areas, and even in the food offerings. Food is cooked traditionally (and plentifully), especially in the market area of Angelmó, where a set of restaurants on stilts lays down giant plates of fried reineta (pomfret), steaming bowls of caldillo de congrio (conger eel soup), and other Chilean specialties. But what might surprise you is that Puerto Montt also has a restaurant for those looking for a more delicate touch, foodies in search of what’s cool and new and traditional all at the same time.\nPatagonia is an area extending down from about the Lakes Region in Chile (and Argentina) to the southernmost reaches of the continent. Most visits to Chilean Patagonia include a little bit of the Lakes Region (near Puerto Varas), and then a flight much further south to the area near Puerto Natales. From streaky sunrises to fiery sunsets, and all the hues of daytime blue from glaciers and lakes, it’s no surprise that the area packs a photographic punch. Here are some stunning views you can catch in Patagonia, though of course, there are many more spots to photograph and pick as your own favorite.\nChile, the long, skinny country that takes up much of the west coast of South America, is perfectly situated for wine. It’s the place of the rediscovery of the long-thought-lost Carmenere grape, and a country that bases much of its export economy on Chilean wine. Certainly no visit to Chile is complete without a vineyard visit, or at the very least, some wine tasting. But beer lovers need not fear, there is plenty of cerveza to go around.\nPhoto: Carlos Leiva\nEvery day traveling with kids is an adventure. But after a series of art and history museums, long walks in the hot sun and/or foreign foods, what every kid needs is an afternoon of free (or semi-structured) time in the park, where all you need is a ball, a blanket, or some imagination to wile away a few hours in the dappled shade of old trees. The city of Santiago has several parks to choose from, but perhaps none so varied and metro-accessible as Parque Quinta Normal, which is just east of downtown, and has its own metro stop."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"advanced_reasoning"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:cd730f85-7e2b-45f1-b6e7-46b59a050a37>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the manufacturing process of clay cookware and what benefits does it provide when cooking?","answer":"Clay cookware manufacturing involves detailed craftsmanship, as seen in traditional methods where potters use techniques like paddle-impressed decoration and special firing processes. For instance, some pottery is made by pounding clay cylinders, creating depressions, and using paddle and anvil techniques to shape the walls, followed by applying glazes or resins during firing. The finished clay vessels offer unique cooking benefits: their porous nature allows heat and moisture to circulate slowly around the food, making it more tender and juicy. Clay cooking requires less oil or fat because it naturally enhances flavors through even heating and steam recirculation. Additionally, the alkaline properties of clay help balance food acidity, resulting in more coherent and rounded flavors, while also helping retain vitamins and minerals during cooking.","context":["By Jeanette Ahn\nThis two-part vessel is a corn roaster sitting on top of a brazier (bray-zee-er). The roaster has a spherical body, rounded base, restricted neck, and simple angular rim. The brazier’s bottom is open so that it can be set directly over the coals, and one side was cut out to let oxygen enter. Both objects have a yellowish-brown glaze, which coats their rims, and a paddle-impressed decoration consisting of bands of vertical lines. To cook corn, a villager would build a fire and let it burn down to glowing coals, then place the brazier over the fire and the corn roaster on top and fill it with corn.\nThese objects are part of the Reith Collection in the UMMAA’s Asian Ethnology division. They were collected by Charlotte Reith, an experienced potter of 25 years, who traveled to Myanmar during the 1990s and 2000s to do research on contemporary pottery making. Reith donated her collection and associated records to the Museum in 2012. The Reith Collection consists of dozens of field notebooks and videotapes, thousands of photographic slides, and more than 200 ceramic vessels and pottery-making tools. (We featured another pot from the Reith Collection in our 200 Objects for 200 Days project; see it here.) See references below for Reith’s four articles about her travels in Myanmar.\nReith actually watched this corn roaster and brazier being made: she took notes and photographs as the potter Pi Kulh Thluai made the vessel from start to finish in Lente, a small village in the Chin Hills.\nReith describes the process in great detail:\n“Pi Kulh Thluai then began to make a pot in a way that I had never observed or even read about… Setting a clay cylinder on the floor in front of her, Pi Kulh Thluai used a flat cord-wrapped paddle to pound the top of the cylinder gently, spreading the clay out a little at the top. She wetted the end of the pounder and inserted it into the middle of the solid clay cylinder, making a depression. She then raised the pounder and struck the clay in the depression, repeating this about for times. Her next step was even more unusual. She inverted the pounder with the clay cylinder still attached, so that the pot was now upside-down, with the walls hanging down. She sat down on a low stool. While using her left hand to turn the pot, she paddled the wall of the pot with the paddle held in her right hand, elongating it. In this case the pounder acted as an anvil to beat against. She then re-inverted the pounder so that the pot rested on the floor… [and] paddled the rim of the clay pot so that it flared out slightly; she then began using a paddle and anvil to compress the pot’s walls, making it taller…. Rather than sitting and turning the pot on her lap as we had seen elsewhere, she stood up and walked around the pot part way and then backed around to the starting position, wielding the long rock anvil against the pot wall on the inside and at the same time applying the paddle from the outside. Pi Kulh Thluai moved these tools in unison against the pot wall as she moved around the pot, sometimes walking all the way around it. To accomplish this, she was bent at the waist in a back-breaking position.” (Reith 1999: 41–42).\nTo Reith’s amazement, even though the corn brazier was not completely dry, the potter could grab the pot without breaking it. Also atypical was the fact that the potter kept adding damp clay on to dryer walls of the pot until it was ready for firing, and the firing process itself, which took only nine minutes. While the pot was still hot, Pi Kulh Thluai applied a yellowish-brown resin (obtained from a local tree), which melted and burst into flame around the pot’s rim.\nThis particular corn roaster and brazier were never used, but an item like this would be an important part of a Lente villager’s household kitchen. In Myanmar, farming is the main occupation for both men and women, and corn is one of the main crops. In 1943, H. N. C. Stevenson, described roasted corn as being prepared in the same way as vai kan (roasted millet). The grain is soaked in water, then steamed, and the grains are spread on mats to dry in the sun. After that, the grain is roasted until it bursts (like puffed wheat). Stevenson describes the traditional grain-roasting pot, called a peibung, as being shaped like a beer-pot with a large hole on one side—a description that fits the Reith corn roaster.\nReith, Charlotte. 1997.

Since their invention about 12,000 years ago, clay pots have been used for good cooking and good eating across cultures and geographies. Clay vessels have unique properties that make them ideal for roasting, baking, steaming, and braising. The porousness of the material allows for heat and moisture to slowly circulate around the dish while it cooks. This makes the resulting food more tender, juicy, and delicious.\nThere are health benefits associated with clay cooking. Recipes do not require as much oil or fat because clay naturally draws out the rich flavors by heating evenly and recirculating steam. Some claim that clay cooking retains vitamins and minerals that otherwise would be lost in the process. Also, the alkaline in clay balances out the acidity in food, which makes the flavors more coherent and rounded.\nCooking and serving in clay cookware encourages a certain thoughtfulness in the kitchen. Gathering for a slow-cooked meal becomes a sought-often moment of respite. We offer a selection of clay cookware pieces, each with a unique story to tell. These made-to-last vessels are a way to connect to traditional cooking techniques from around the world and make your own memories.\nChamba (La Chamba, Colombia)\nChamba cookware is handmade by local artisans in La Chamba, Colombia, out of natural clay. Each piece is burnished with stones and fired on site. Chamba earthenware pieces are unglazed; their distinctive black color coming from the clay and how they are fired in the kiln. We use Chamba dishes in our Café because they retain the heat well from our oven to your table. The smooth black finish makes the vessels appear strikingly modern. However, the origins of the vessel’s design can be traced back 700 years to pre-Columbian archaeological sites.\nThe Chamba roaster and bean pots are designed for cooking meats, stews, and pulses. The lid-less options are the Chamba Oval Platter for roasting and baking, and the Chamba Comal for heating tortillas and roasting chilies.\nOaxacan Collection (San Marcos Tlapazola, Oaxaca, Mexico)\nWe are proud to offer a selection of clay earthenware from Oaxaca. These pieces were created in San Marcos Tlapazola in collaboration with Colectivo 1050º, a design guild devoted to maintaining and advancing Oaxacan craft tradition. There are over seventy pottery villages in Oaxaca, each with distinct workshops and artisans. Eric Mindling’s book Fire and Clay: The Art of Oaxacan Pottery is an essential introduction to the culture imbued in Oaxacan pottery.\nThe Elia Cooking Pot is suited for beans, soups, and braising meat. The Elia Rice Pot can be used for rice and other grains. The Clay Grill is a portable grill for meat and vegetables, as well as a mobile stovetop for cooking soup and warming tortillas. It is an intricately made and striking to watch in action.\nManufacture de Digoin (Burgundy, France)\nFounded in 1875, Manufacture de Digoin originated as a family ceramic business in the northern Loire valley and established itself crafting staples of the French kitchen. Digoin specializes in earthenware and stoneware made from local materials. Each piece of pottery is hand-shaped by artisans and made to stand the test of time.\nWe’re honored to be Manufacture de Digoin’s first collaboration with a U.S. company. Digoin’s selection of clay cookware includes unglazed and glazed pieces that serve a variety of functions. The Unglazed Roasting Pot works like a stove-top to roast potatoes, beets, and even chestnuts and coffee beans. The Unglazed Terracotta Roaster is ideal for baking bread (the clay will keep the insides soft and the make crust crispy) and roasting chicken – check out our roast chicken recipe. This type of roaster dates back to Roman times and is nicknamed the “four crétois,” which translates as “the Cretan oven” or “Mediterranean oven.”\nNagatani-en Pottery (Iga, Japan)\nWe source our donabes, traditional Japanese clay pots, from the Nagatani-en clayware house founded in 1832. Nagatani-en is the leading producer of Iga-yaki pottery, which is crafted from clay from the 4-million-year-old seabed of Lake Biwa. Iga-yaki donabes are handcrafted, each taking two weeks to complete. Donabe cooking has been traced by 10,000 years, yet the vessel remains a modern kitchen staple.\nThe Donabe Clay Smoker can be used for grilling vegetables and fish (here’s our getting started guide). Due to its thick clay body, the Donabe Rice Cooker steam-cooks rice even after it is removed from the heat source, making the rice extra fluffy. The Donabe Clay Steamer is an impressive cooking and serving vessel well-suited for fish, chicken, or vegetables."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:fc0ff686-b971-4e5a-bd93-5843532a1ac5>","<urn:uuid:8dc7024a-62e8-4f07-89a9-17f211c6bbf0>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the key difference between how unwanted reflections are handled in professional control rooms versus home studios when it comes to speaker placement and wall surfaces?","answer":"In professional control rooms, unwanted reflections are handled through careful planning of speaker placement and surfaces, particularly focusing on controlling reflections from the console face and ensuring bilateral symmetry. They use specific reflecting surfaces in the ceiling and walls adjacent to speakers, with careful attention to angles and materials. In home studios, the approach is more remedial, typically using acoustic absorption panels at reflection points - behind monitors, on side walls nearest the monitors, and on the ceiling above monitors. The reflection points in home studios can be found using a simple mirror technique, placing absorptive panels where monitor reflections appear.","context":["R-e/p: Tell us about redoing the control room for Village.\nGEORGE AUGSPURGER: From my standpoint, even before getting into the subtleties of those things that the client may like, there are a number of things you do in any control room.\nOne is that you try to get the thing as nearly as possible to be bilaterally symmetrical. You’re stuck with two channel and four channel stereo, which are both oriented left and right, and to get any kind of control in the center of the room you’ve got to have the left and right identical.\nSo the first thing to do is to make the left and the right halves of the room identical, at least acoustically, if you can manage that. And in this case, (Village studio B) that was easy. We shoved the center of the console over a foot or fourteen inches, and developed the whole room symmetrically from the mixer’s position.\nThen the next thing we try to do is to work with the location of the monitor speakers and the immediate surfaces surrounding the monitor speakers. We try to get a reasonable amount of diffusion in the front part of the room, and try to make use of desirable first order reflections and try to control the undesirable ones.\nThe desirable ones are the ones that help localize the image where you want it and help direct the sound toward the area of the console, where the people are hearing it.\nThe undesirable ones are, for example, a reflection off the right wall of the room from the left hand speaker, or something like that cutters up your image. One of the biggest problems is to avoid echoes that ricochet right off the face of the console. This thing is always sitting there, it’s a big reflective surface and it’s always a problem.\nR-e/p: Well, specifically what did you do for the Village’s reflections?\nGEORGE AUGSPURGER: We used, in this case, two major reflecting surfaces in the ceiling area, above the speakers. We used the side walls immediately adjacent to the speakers. We knew we were going to flush-mount the speakers in the space that was already there, and those immediate surfaces were all worked out, in an attempt to get the proper characteristics.\nR-e/p: Did you mean in terms of the angles and the surface material?\nGEORGE AUGSPURGER: Right. Those are valuable primarily as reflecting surfaces; there’s not very much absorption on those surfaces. There’s a reflector up there which was suspended so it could be adjusted after it was hung up, in case we wanted to make slight changes. Then, once you get to that stage, you start worrying about the rear speakers.\nAdmittedly they are not as important as the front ones, but you try to keep their orientation and the overall sound as close as you possibly can to the front speakers. You start worrying about unwanted reflections, primarily off the rear wall, where people like to stack up racks and tape machines and things like that.\nFortunately, in this case we did not have any tall things back there. And you start worrying about the effect of the normal room resonances down in the low frequency region, because once you get into the bass region, as you well know, every moderate to small room just becomes a big resonator with its own characteristics.\nWhat we try to do there is to control the ones that you can predict. You can never predict all of them but you try to control the ones you can predict in relation to the console location. In other words, at this point, you have to give up statistical acoustics. You can’t say, “Well, on the average, there are going to be so many modes in the room,” because the only ones you care about are the ones that are screwing you up right there at the console location.\nSo we try to break up the major floor-to-ceiling mode which usually is a problem. We use sloping surfaces and traps.","Chances are, unless your home studio was specifically designed for recording and mixing music, it’s a less than ideal listening environment. Professional studios are carefully planned out to eliminate naturally occurring acoustic issues in a way that residential rooms are not. A well designed one will have no parallel surfaces and ample acoustic treatment.\nTo get the most out of your home studio, adding acoustic treatment can minimize many of the major problems that misrepresent what recordings and mixes actually sound like.\nProblems to Consider in Your Studio\nStanding waves are produced when a wall’s dimension is equal to, or a multiple of, the wavelength of a particular frequency. They occur when sound waves bounce between parallel surfaces, such as between opposite walls and between the floor and ceiling.\nStanding waves are a form of interference. As reflected waves collide with the original sound source, they can either combine or cancel each other out. This is referred to as constructive and destructive interference, respectively. The result of constructive interference is an unnaturally loud frequency, while the opposite is true of destructive interference. This typically occurs in the low end with frequencies around 300 Hz and below–those with longer wavelengths.\nSuch interference can create an inaccurate representation of the low end material in a mix. If your room has a constructive standing wave at, say, 100 Hz, you may compensate by carving out that particular frequency in the mix. When played in a different environment, your mix may be too thin.\nEarly reflections are those sounds first reaching our ears after bouncing off of a single surface in our listening environment. Psychoacoustically, our brain quickly determines the level and directionality of a sound source.\nCombining with the direct sound leaving our speakers, early reflections can alter our perception of where a sound is placed in the stereo field and how loud it is.\nJust as with standing waves, early reflections at higher frequencies can move through cycles of constructive and destructive interference with the direct sound. The result is a phenomenon known as comb filtering–a frequency response with sharp peaks and dips resembling a fine-tooth comb.\nAcoustic Treatment Options\nEven though home studios are often problematic listening environments, a little bit of acoustic treatment from DIY acoustic panels can make a drastic difference.\nWhile it’s nearly impossible to treat every acoustic issue without building a pro studio from the ground up, working on standing waves and early reflections is a fantastic start. Most importantly, it can be done on a budget, as well. The following are the three most common types of acoustic treatment used to combat the issues mentioned above.\nAcoustic absorption is used to tame the mids and highs in a given environment. You’ll want to use absorption to treat the early reflection points in your room: behind your monitors; on each side wall nearest the monitors; and on the ceiling above your monitors.\nFinding the early reflection points in a room can be as simple as running a mirror along the wall and placing an absorptive panel where a monitor is reflected in the mirror. Again, these points will be somewhere on the back wall behind your monitors, on each side wall nearest the listening position, and on the ceiling above your listening position.\nMany companies produce absorption commercially, but building them yourself is a much more cost-effective alternative if you have the tools and time.\n1″ x 4″ lumber and R13 denim insulation is easy to work with and leaves you with effective 4″-thick absorption! If your handy, check out our guide to building your own acoustic panels.\nPlaced in the corners of rooms, bass traps are used to control the low end response of a space. In small rooms especially, unwanted buildup of low end material can be a huge problem.\nIdeally, floor-to-ceiling bass trapping straddling each corner of the studio at a 45-degree angle is ideal. If you are looking for more guidance on building these out on a budget check out our guide to DIY bass traps for your home studio.\nIf you don’t have the space or resources to fill each corner entirely, don’t hesitate to straddle each corner with a panel like the ones mentioned previously in a size that suits your environment.\nWhile bass traps and absorption are used to absorb frequencies, acoustic diffusion is designed to evenly scatter frequencies throughout a space.\nIn most cases, we don’t want an entirely dead mixing environment. Diffusion, placed on the back wall of a home studio, takes sound waves and scatters them throughout the space.\nWhile we haven’t lost any acoustic energy as we have with absorption, the scattered sound makes it much harder for our ours to determine where reflections are coming from, and how loud they are.\nDiffusion essentially de-concentrates sound waves in the listening environment. Diffusers are commonly made of a hard, reflective material like wood, and may be of the “skyline,” “triangular,” or “spherical” variety.\nFor further information on the basics of acoustic treatment, please enjoy this interview with renowned educator and engineer, Bobby Owsinski!"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"illustrative_examples"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:5ee2b96d-9345-4f38-a495-5a1341638c0c>","<urn:uuid:849b2582-0ac3-4934-adca-8269290b6b9d>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Looking to remove some trees - what's proper felling technique and why should I be careful about choosing an arborist?","answer":"Proper felling requires three specific cuts: two cuts creating a notch (one-third of tree diameter) on the fall side, and a back cut on the opposite side 5cm above notch bottom, leaving 15cm of hingewood for control. This technique prevents trunk jumping and allows controlled falling. When choosing an arborist, be cautious because improper tree care can take years to correct. Verify their ISA certification, insurance coverage, and membership in professional organizations like ISA or TCIA. Request references, check their previous work, and avoid accepting low bids without examining credentials. Remember that proper tree care is a long-lasting investment that affects property value.","context":["How to cut down a tree\nWhen a tree just has to come down, make sure you and your equipment are up to the task\nOkay, you’ve run through the checklist and decided you can handle the cut. Now you need to arm yourself with the proper equipment and the know-how to use it. If your only cutting challenge was to take down the odd short, small tree (say 15 cm in diameter or less), then an old-fashioned bowsaw would do the job nicely. But since trees are often larger and felling is just the first step, most folks invest in the speed and ease of a chainsaw to cut logs and branches into shorter lengths, either for fuel or just to carry away.\nProfessional arborists are mandated by law to wear CSA-approved boots, chainsaw pants, hard hats, ear protection, eye protection, and heavy gloves on the job. What makes sense for you as a casual cutter? According to Ted Whitworth, field services manager with the Farm Safety Association, “you’ll certainly need ear and eye protection, and heavy gloves to prevent cuts and scrapes.” And since a third of all chainsaw injuries are leg-related, some form of lower-limb protection is strongly recommended. “Chainsaw chaps are generally cooler and lighter than the pants used by the pros, yet they still offer protection from saw chain injuries to the front of your legs,” explains Whitworth. Chaps cost about $100, so it makes sense for two or three cottages to get together and buy a pair between them. Chaps with calf protection for the back of your legs are best.\nAny saw you use should be equipped with a chain brake – a feature that halts the travel of the saw chain if the machine bucks upward unpredictably. This bucking, called kickback, happens in an instant and accounts for nearly a half of all chainsaw injuries. Although manufacturers now regularly include chain brakes on new machines, older saws don’t always have them. For that reason, inspect carefully for a brake before you rent a chainsaw, or if you’re considering purchasing a used one.\nThe top half of the tip of any chainsaw bar is the primary kickback danger zone because the chain is travelling nearly straight down at this point. Since restriction of the chain’s travel in this area is the major cause of kickback, the best way to avoid it is by preventing any contact between the chainsaw’s tip and the wood. A dull chain is also more likely to kick back than a sharp one because it’s less able to slice through wood, and more likely to ride on top of it. Feeling tired? Stop sawing. Fatigue increases the chance you’ll make mistakes leading to kickback.\nBringing it down\nProper felling technique involves three saw cuts that work together to create a hinging action that influences the direction of a tree’s fall. At the same time, they prevent the butt from jumping up or twisting wildly as the trunk hits the earth. The first two cuts, made about 0.3 metres from the ground on the side the tree will naturally fall, create a notch into the trunk about one-third the tree’s diameter. The third cut — the back cut — is horizontal, entering the side opposite the notch, 5 cm above its bottom face, and penetrating inward to within about 15 cm of the notch’s point. It’s important that the back cut doesn’t intersect with the first two: The uncut wood fibres across the centre of the trunk — about 15 per cent of the thickness of the tree — create a hinge that keeps it under some control as you move back and away from the stump yelling Timber! Cutting through the hingewood is a dangerous mistake made by amateur fellers, and can allow the tree to fall in an unpredictable direction or to buck into the air as it hits the ground.\nIf you call in a pro\nIf you have to call in an arborist, know that you’re buying more than expertise. You’re buying insurance, too. At least you should be. “Up to 30% of what we charge customers goes straight for liability protection,” explains Steven Mann of Bartlett Tree Experts. Every tree business is required by law to carry two kinds of coverage: a minimum of $1 million general liability insurance to protect property, plus Worker’s Compensation insurance for every employee on site. “If you hire a so-called pro to cut a tree on your property and an accident happens, you may be named in a lawsuit if the arborist wasn’t properly insured, even if the accident wasn’t your fault,” says Mann. “Ask to see valid insurance certificates that specifically mention cutting trees before agreeing to any kind of work.” The only time Worker’s Compensation coverage isn’t required is when the owners of the tree-cutting business (not employees) are doing the actual work. Rates for removing trees run about $1,200 to $1,600 per day of labour for a two-person crew. And when it comes time to sign the cheque, don’t get conned into paying PST. Tree removal is a service only, so GST is all you need to fork over to the government.\nJump to a section\n- Page 1 : Making the cut, a cottager's checklist »\n- Page 2 : Safety tips, bringing it down, & calling in pros","Why Hire An Arborist?\nAn arborist is a specialist in the care of individual trees. Arborists are knowledgeable about the needs of trees, and are trained and equipped to provide proper care. Hiring an arborist is a decision that should not be taken lightly. Proper tree care is an investment which can lead to substantial returns. Well-cared-for trees are attractive and can add considerable value to your property. Poorly maintained trees can be a significant liability. Pruning or removing trees, especially large trees, can be dangerous work. Tree work should only be done by those trained and equipped to work safely in trees.\nSelecting the Right Arborist for the Job\nThere are a variety of things to consider when selecting an arborist which include:\n- Membership in professional organizations such as the International Society of Arboriculture (ISA), the Kansas Arborist Association (KAA) and the Tree Care Industry Association (TCIA) demonstrates a willingness on the part of the arborist to stay up-to-date on the latest techniques and information.\n- Check in the phone directory yellow pages for those arborists who advertise as ISA Certified Arborists or display the official logo of the ISA Certified Arborist. Certified arborists are experienced professionals who have passed an extensive examination covering all aspects of tree care.\n- Ask for proof of insurance and then phone the insurance company if you are not satisfied. A reputable arborist will have personal and property damage insurance as well as workers compensation insurance. Many homeowners have had to pay out large amounts of money for damages caused by an uninsured individual claiming to be a tree expert. You could be held responsible for damages and injuries that occur as a result of the job.\n- Some governmental agencies require contractors to apply for permits and/or to apply for a license before they are able to work. Be sure they comply with any local, state, provincial or national law that governs their work.\n- Ask for references to find out where the company has done work similar to the work you are requesting. Don't hesitate to check references or visit other worksites where the company or individual has done tree work. Remember, tree care is a substantial, long-lasting investment; you would not buy a car without a test drive!\n- Be wary of individuals who go door-to-door and offer bargains for performing tree work. Most reputable companies are too occupied to solicit work in this manner. Improper tree care can take many years to correct itself and in some cases never corrects itself. Are you willing to take that risk with your valuable investment?\n- Good arborists will only perform accepted practices. For example, practices such as topping a tree, removing an excessive amount of live wood, using climbing spikes on trees which are not being removed, and removing or disfiguring living trees without just cause, are unnecessary.\n- Don't always accept the low bid. You should examine the credentials and the written specification of the firms who submitted bids and determine the best combination of price, work to be done, skill and professionalism to protect your substantial investment.\nWhat is a Certified Arborist?\nAn arborist by definition is an individual who is trained in the art and science of planting, caring for and maintaining individual trees. ISA Arborist Certification is a non-governmental, voluntary process by which individuals can document their base of knowledge. It operates without mandate of law and is an internal, self-regulating device administered by the International Society of Arboriculture. Certification provides a measurable assessment of an individual's knowledge and competence required to provide proper tree care.\n- Certification is not a measure of standards of practice. Certification can attest to the tree knowledge of an individual, but cannot guarantee or ensure quality performance.\n- Certified arborists are individuals who have achieved a level of knowledge in the art and science of tree care through at least three years experience and who have passed a comprehensive examination developed by some of the nation's leading experts on tree care. Certified arborists must also continue their education to maintain their certification. Therefore, they should be up-to-date on the latest techniques in arboriculture.What are the Benefits of Trees?\n- Most trees and shrubs in cities or communities are planted to provide beauty or shade. These are two excellent reasons for their use. Woody plants also serve many other purposes, and it often is helpful to consider these other functions when selecting a tree or shrub for the landscape. The benefits of trees can be grouped into the following catagories:\n- Communal Benefits. Trees bring natural elements and wildlife habitats into urban surroundings; all of which incerease the quality of life for residents of the community\n- Environmental Benefits. Trees alter the environment in which we live by moderating climate, improving air quality, conserving water, and harboring wildlife.\n- Economic Benefits. Property values of landscapted homes are 5-20% higher than those of non-landscaped homes.\nTree Hazard Checklist?\nConsider these questions:\n- Are there large dead branches in the tree?\n- Are there detached branches hanging in the tree?\n- Does the tree have cavities or rotten wood along the trunk or in major branches?\n- Are mushrooms present at the base of the tree?\n- Are there cracks or splits in the trunk or where branches are attached?\n- Have any branches fallen from the tree?\n- Has the trunk developed a strong lean?\n- Have the roots been broken off, injured, or damaged by lowering the soil level, installing pavement, repairing sidewalks, or digging trenches?\n- Has the site recently been changed by construction, raising the soil level, or installing lawns?\n- Has the tree been topped or otherwise heavily pruned?\n- Dead or Dying tree?\nWhy Topping Hurts Trees\nTopping is perhaps the most harmful tree pruning practice known. Topping is the indiscriminate cutting of tree branches to stubs or lateral branches that are not large enough to assume the terminal role. The most common reason given for topping is to reduce the size of a tree. Home owners often feel that their trees have become too large for their property. In fact, topping will make a tree more hazardous in the long term.\n- Topping stresses trees\n- Topping causes decay\n- Topping creates hazards\n- Topping makes trees ugly"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_expressive"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:014cfaa8-1893-48e9-ac80-69eaffe35a23>","<urn:uuid:efb04c10-394d-46a7-99cf-5bedc3cd932b>"],"error":null}
{"question":"Hello! I'm interested in different voting systems. Could you explain how Australia's Single Transferable Vote works in the Senate and how Iceland applied it in their Constitutional Assembly election?","answer":"The Single Transferable Vote (STV) system works differently in these contexts. In Australia's Senate, it's used as a proportional representation system where if candidates don't win enough first-place votes to get a seat, weaker candidates are eliminated and their votes transferred to others based on second and third choices. The system also reallocates 'surplus' votes of winning candidates to ensure proportional results. This allows parties like the Greens to consistently get about 10% of Senate seats, matching their vote share. In Iceland's 2010 Constitutional Assembly election, STV was used to elect 25 members, with voters ranking up to 25 candidates. The quota (minimum votes needed for election) was calculated by dividing total voters by 26 (number of seats plus one). This resulted in candidates potentially being elected with strong support from a small group even if rejected by the majority, while candidates ranked second or third by most voters could be excluded if few ranked them first.","context":["This article on election of persons is based on an actual state of affairs. The purpose is to highlight characteristics of the single transferable vote, which have not been dealt with in voting theory. The uninitiated needs to know the following background facts before reading on.\nAn amendment of the Icelandic constitution is brought about in the following way: After the parliament has adopted an amendment it is dissolved at once and new elections are held. As soon as the new parliament has confirmed the amendment it comes into force.\nAs a consequence of the financial turmoil in Iceland since 2008 an interest for new procedure for bringing about amendments to the constitution emerged. In 2010 an act was passed on for electing a body for presenting to the parliament a proposition for a new constitution. This body was to be composed of 25 members who were to be elected by single transferable vote, a procedure without precedence in Iceland.\nTo become a candidate was relatively easy and the number was astonishingly high, 522 in all. Voters were to elect – and rank – up to 25 candidates.\nThe election of persons on 27 November was a thought promoter. On election day I was present at the largest polling-station in Reykjavik as supervisor. There a Scottish gentleman, who had been invited by the Ministry of Justice in connection with the elections, contacted me. He had been in Iceland on an earlier occasion, i.e. in September, invited by the parliament, then in connection with the handling of the proposed act. He had, as he told me, rewritten the Act for the parliament.\nThe Scotchman told me the following: This method is in use in Scotland, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and Canada – the British world, he interposed – as well as in Cambridge in Massachusetts, New England. The number of persons to be elected could very well be ten to twelve, seventy being the highest number so far since the method was first applied. Then the voter was to elect – and rank – all the candidates, e.g. 1, 2, etc. all the way up to 69, 70. For the election of Members to the body that shall propose amendments to Iceland´s constitution each voter shall elect – and rank – only 25 candidates.\nHere this method will be evaluated with reference to the lessons of the November elections.\nBut first we would like to introduce a tentative example: One person is to be elected. There are 21 voters. To determine the quota. i.e the number of votes a candidate must have to be elected, a divisor must be set. The divisor equals the number of candidates to be elected plus the number 1. The number of voters, i.e. 21, is then divided by this number, i.e. 21/2 = 10.5.\nThe quota is found by eliminating the decimal and adding 1. Consequently the quota is 11.\nThere are 5 candidates: A, B, C, D and E. Eleven voters rank them as follows:\nwhile 10 voters rank them:\nThe number of votes spent on A equal the quota. The 11 voters who place him at top put B right below him. The ones who place B at top put A at the bottom. With this voting method it does not change anything.\nThis example is presented to compare single transferable vote with sequential choice in Democracy with Sequential Choice and Fund Voting. In sequential choice B would come out first: He receives 10x4 points for the top position, and 11x3 for position 2, i.e. 73 points in all. A receives 11x4 points for position 1 but none for the bottom position.\nNow let us examine what the outcome of such an evaluation by the voters, i.e. wishing to counteract the election of specific candidates, would have been if the method applied at the election of the Constitution Assembly last November had been used. In our example 25 are to be elected, i.e the divisor is 25+1. Let us also assume the following: The number of voters is 100,000. The quota, i.e. the number of votes needed for a candidate to be elected is 3,847. A is placed at the top by 3,900 voters so he is safely in. That would also have been the case even if no other voters had placed him among the 25 ranked. That could also have been the fate of B, who was put at top by 3,850 voters, even if no other voter had included him in their selection. Therefore it is conceivable that 25 candidates are elected, each backed by only a small number but rejected by a vast majority. On the other hand there is a possibility that candidates, who are placed number two or three by most voters, have no chance of being elected because so few of them are placed first in the list.\nOf the 25 who were elected for the Constitution Assembly 22 reside in the capital area, 2 in the principal town of Northern Iceland, but only 1 elsewhere. This was the outcome but it is to be presumed that no voter actually wanted things to turn out that way. It is a fact that there is no co-ordination in single transferable vote, it is a coincidence what the final combination will be like. The same is even true of an election of only two persons. That I shall now demonstrate by a near-authentic example.\nAt a given school the teachers are to elect two teachers for the School Board. The school has premises at two locations, in Ladies' Street – with subjects taught mostly by women – and in Gents' Street with subjects taught mostly by men. Everybody agrees that both places shall be represented – as well as both sexes. In an unbound election of persons or in single transferable vote where every voter places teachers of both sexes and from both locations at top it is not at all sure that the result will match the opinion held by all; it can easily happen that two men will be elected from Gents' Street or two women from Ladies' Street. By applying sequential choice of pairs this can be avoided. A list of all possible combinations will be established and each pair given an identification. The voters rank the pairs and the points will be calculated according to the rules for sequential choice.\nThis is quite easy when only two shall be elected and there are only two attributes to be taken into consideration. When 25 shall be elected and there is a number of attributes to be taken into consideration, sequential choice is not so easy to apply. The discussion of sequential choice for electing board members in Democracy with Sequential Choice and Fund Voting presents an approach that is without the detriments which are so characteristic of the single transferable vote, as we have seen.\nMorgunblaðið, 2 February 2011 19 [translated from the Icelandic with minor amendments]","Ideas that work to increase voter turnout\nNot every country is plagued by rules that limit voters’ participation in elections, as is common in the United States.\nIn the past five years, restrictions on voting and voter registration purges have limited the number of Americans eligible to cast ballots.\nIn addition, the U.S. is the only major democracy that still allows politicians to draw their own district lines, an often-criticized conflict of interest in which public officials essentially pick their voters, rather than the voters picking their officials. That computer-aided gerrymandering of electoral districts reduces the number of districts with competitive races, contributing to low voter turnout.\nPerhaps the fundamental problem, though, is that the system yields results the people don’t actually want. Twice in the last two decades, U.S. voters chose a president, George W. Bush and Donald Trump, who got fewer votes than his rival, Al Gore and Hillary Clinton.\nAll these problems are avoidable and don’t happen in countries that have different voting laws. Perhaps the best example is Australia, a country which is culturally, demographically and socioeconomically similar to the U.S. In my book “Rethinking U.S. Election Law,” written while I lived and studied their system Down Under, I outline many of the ways Australia has solved voting quandaries that persist in the U.S.\nMandatory voting, made easy\nAustralia’s most strikingly different law requires voting. All Australians must register to vote and actually cast a ballot. Not voting means a small fine (AU$20, or about US$14) will be imposed.\nAustralians don’t have to actually vote for a candidate: They can leave it blank, write in “none of the above” or even draw a picture – but they do have to turn in a ballot. As a result, Australia enjoys voter registration and turnout rates over 90%.\nVoting is easier in Australia than in the U.S.. All voters can cast their ballots by mail, vote in person ahead of Election Day or show up to the polls on Election Day itself – which is always on a Saturday, when most people are off from work.\nA different way of counting\nAustralia’s vote-counting rules are also different in important ways.\nFor its House elections, Australia uses what is called “preferential voting,” a form of ranked-choice voting.\nVoters are allowed to rank their candidates in order of preference – 1st, 2nd, 3rd and so on. If a candidate’s first-choice votes add up to a majority of the overall ballots cast, that candidate wins, just like in any other system.\nIf no one wins a majority of the votes cast, the candidate with the fewest first-choice votes is eliminated and their supporters’ votes are redistributed according to these voters’ second choices. This process of eliminating candidates and redistributing those candidates’ supporters continues until one candidate has a majority.\nThis system eliminates what is at times called the “spoiler” problem in U.S. elections, where too many similar candidates split the majority’s vote, allowing a less-preferred candidate to win with a minority of the votes cast. For instance, in 2000, people could have voted for Ralph Nader while also showing that they would have preferred either of the other two candidates for president, Al Gore or George W. Bush.\nEven with ranked-choice voting, any system where a single representative is elected for each district is vulnerable to gerrymandering. The lines can be drawn to give one party more seats than its mathematical vote share warrants.\nTo reduce that problem, Australia’s election districts are drawn by the Australian Electoral Commission, a politically independent commission of nonpartisan technical experts.\nIt’s well respected for being nonpartisan, with a good track record of keeping politics out of the redistricting process.\nBut even the Australian Electoral Commission isn’t perfect. As I detail in my book, like-minded people naturally cluster together in communities. That creates what some scholars have called “unintentional gerrymandering.” In the U.S., for example, Democratic voters overconcentrated in urban areas are unavoidably consolidated into districts with large Democratic supermajorities. That partially explains why, until recently, Republicans controlled the Virginia state legislature for years, even as Democrats won all the statewide and presidential elections.\nOne way to fix the problem of gerrymandering – whether intentional or otherwise – is to move away from the concept of “winner-take-all” elections, in which 51% of the votes yields 100% of the power. In that system, significant minority voting blocs end up with no representation, leading to frustration and alienation.\nFor legislative elections, one potential solution could be proportional representation, in which a party earning 30% of the vote receives approximately 30% of the seats available. Rather than “winner take all,” this is “majority takes most, and minorities take their fair share.”\nProportional representation systems don’t have single-member districts, like having one congressperson per congressional district. Rather, representatives are elected either at-large or in multi-member districts. With districting eliminated, gerrymandering becomes impossible. Australia uses this system for its Senate, using a different form of ranked-choice voting called the single transferable vote.\nLike the single-winner ranked-choice voting used in Australia’s House, if no candidate wins enough first-place votes to get a seat, weaker candidates are eliminated and their votes transferred to others based on second and third choices. But single transferable vote systems also reallocate what might be called “surplus” votes of winning candidates – extra votes beyond what candidates need to actually win – to ensure a more proportionate result.\nProportional representation allows third parties to thrive, giving voters more choices. Australia offers a natural experiment between methods: For the last half-century, Australian voters nationwide have chosen single-member House representatives and used proportional representation to elect its Senate.\nThe result is that the Green Party consistently gets about 10% of the national vote, but zero seats in the House. However, in the Senate it gets about 10% of the seats, giving it a voice in the legislative debate. The difference is the move from winner-take-all in the House to proportional representation in the Senate. In addition, major parties vie to get second-choice support from Green Party backers, so the Greens’ concerns have real influence over national policies.\nAll these ideas – voting by mail, early voting, Saturday voting, ranked-choice voting, an independent redistricting commission and proportional representation – make Australia’s democracy more inclusive and representative than in the U.S.\nSteven Mulroy is a law professor in Constitutional Law, Criminal Law and Election Law at the University of Memphis.

Cutting-edge bioarchaeological research on skeletons from the Vedrovice cemetery in the Czech Republic is providing illuminating answers. Paul Pettitt and Marek Zvelebil report.\nThe man oozed status. He died in the 53rd century BC, in his early 30s. Although his age at death was fairly typical for his people, he died violently. Someone had delivered a crushing blow to his skull. Perhaps he had suffered pains ever since the wound was received, as an attempt had been made to trepan his skull at the point of the wound – a remarkably rare example of early surgery. But it seems that his injuries troubled him until the day he died, as he was buried on his left side, his hands placed close to his temples as if to relieve the pain.\nAs an experienced elder of the community he had achieved a high status. His grave, in the so-called Vedrovice cemetery in Central Europe, contained a jug and a bowl that were probably his eating and drinking vessels in life, an adze made of a stone imported from a source as distant as the Bohemian Massif or Western Carpathians or the Balkans, a flint blade from the Krakow Jura, a spondylus shell necklace, marble beads, four perforated deer teeth, and two grinding stones.\nA large amount of red ochre was found around his upper body and under his skull, red being, perhaps, the colour of transformation and passage from one life to another. He wore pendants and a bracelet made from spondylus shells that originated in the Mediterranean. Born at or near Vedrovice, he was a local man and remained in the area until his death. Throughout his life he had a varied diet of wild and domestic plants and animals, but, more than his fellow villagers, he had enjoyed regular access to meat.\nVedrovice and the spread of LBK\nThe man, known as ‘Burial 15/75’, belonged to the Early Neolithic, the period in which agriculture – with its origins in the Fertile Crescent of the Near East – was replacing the old traditions of hunting and gathering across Europe. Specifically, he belonged to the Linear Pottery Culture or LBK, a loose agglomeration of agricultural hamlets focussed on longhouses and bound by a common world view and cultural tradition. His grave at Vedrovice lies within the earliest-known LBK cemetery in the Czech Republic.\nThe LBK tradition, characterised by pottery decorated with linear bands, originated out of the Balkan Neolithic. How domesticated life spread to Vedrovice is one of the major questions of our research and that of fellow prehistorians. Certainly, within a few centuries of its appearance at Vedrovice, the LBK culture and traditions would spread right across Central Europe and as far west as the Paris Basin and The Netherlands.\nThis spread of agriculture in Europe – literally a domestication of the continent – was a revolutionary development in human history. It opened up a whole range of new possibilities for people who were otherwise solely reliant upon gathering and hunting of wild resources. Now, plants and animals could be brought under clear control, and support larger population sizes that could be gathered together in permanent communities. New relationships between people and their resources opened up new areas of the landscape for exploitation. New traditions were introduced, in ceramics, chipped and polished stone tools, but perhaps most impressive was the development of the LBK longhouse – the largest structure Central Europe would see until the Iron Age.\nThis article is an extract from the full article published in World Archaeology Issue 32.

{"question":"Which types of epidural injections are available for back pain treatment?","answer":"There are 3 types of epidural injections: 1) Intra-laminar epidurals, where steroid medication is placed under the bone overlying the spinal canal, 2) Transforaminal epidurals, where the needle is placed closer to the nerve root compression area, and 3) Caudal epidurals, where cortisone is injected through the buttock region and flows up from the bottom of the spinal canal.","context":["Patients have benefited from epidural injections since they were invented back in the 1950s. They can provide excellent pain relief for conditions such as sciatica or radiculopathy from herniated discs, along with symptoms from spinal stenosis compressing nerves.\nEpidural injections work exceptionally well which is why they have remained in steady use over the past 60 years. The success overall of epidural injections has exceeded 75% consistently in research studies. The absolute best results with epidural injections are obtained when the patient has other treatment options as well including chiropractic treatment, spinal decompression therapy, physical therapy, acupuncture and massage. If these treatments are used in combination, success rates may be well over 95% in pain relief and avoiding surgery.\nEpidural injections are a pain relieving procedure. They’re not intended to fix any problem, but are designed to mask a patient’s pain. They can allow individuals to participate better in their physical therapy, play with their kids, get back to work, and reduce the need for narcotic medications for pain control.\nThey work well in both the neck, the thoracic spine, and the lumbar spine. They’re not meant as a treatment for simply neck pain or back pain itself. They are truly meant for pain that radiates out into the arms and legs from a pinched nerve. When a nerve is pinched from a herniated disc for instance, that in and of itself does not cause pain. What that does is spark up inflammation, which can then cause the radiating pain. It is the heavy anti-inflammatory nature of the steroid medication that is administered which relieves the pain by bathing the nerve roots with the cortisone.\nEpidural injections are administered in an outpatient setting. Patients may receive IV sedation, but it is not absolutely necessary. They may just need some local numbing medicine where the needle is being placed into the skin. Currently almost all epidural injections involve steroid medication. In the future, most likely we will end up seeing some nonsteroidal medications and probably some stem cell injection materials as well.\nThere are 3 different types of epidural injections. These are intra-laminar epidural injections, which were the first type invented and involve placing the steroid medication just under the bone overlying the spinal canal. These work well but about a decade ago a new type of epidural was invented.\nThis option places the needle much closer to the area of nerve root compression and this is called a transforaminal epidural steroid injection. The foramen is where the nerve root leaves the spine and this injection goes out this area so it is called “transforaminal”. This is very common in the lumbar spine but not so common in the cervical spine. Up around the neck there is a potential for very serious competitions so most pain management doctors do not offer this kind of epidural injection there.\nThe third type of epidural injection is called a caudal epidural. A pain management doctor places the cortisone through the buttock region through an area called the sacral ala. The steroid medication is then injected along with some numbing medicine and it flows from the bottom of the spinal canal up and can reach a few levels for pain relief. This type of injection works better when a patient has multiple nerve roots compressed such as in spinal stenosis.\nOverall, the complication rates from epidural steroid injections are very low. The good to excellent results hover between 75 to 90%. This is equivalent to surgical outcomes at the one-year point. A large study was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association showing that at the one-year point results were equivalent but the patients who had epidurals were able to avoid the risks of surgery.\nPrior to undergoing spine surgery, individuals should look to see if epidural injections could help possibly avoid undergoing the knife."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"factoid"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:33b51c3b-4b92-49fa-9554-96e9071b4011>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What role do students play in improving public facilities, and what safety measures must they follow?","answer":"Students with learning difficulties from Derwen College contribute to public facilities by running the station's café and creating art projects like the African-themed toilet mural at Gobowen station. When working in public spaces, they must follow security protocols including protecting mobile devices, using strong passwords, maintaining up-to-date security protection, and being cautious with public WiFi. They should also avoid using public computers for sensitive information and be aware of physical security threats in public areas.","context":["Travellers using the facilities at a Shropshire train station could be forgiven for thinking they’ve taken a wrong turn, after its toilet was transformed to resemble an African savannah, reports Samantha King.\nStation toilets generally don’t have the best reputation, but thanks to students at Derwen College, the toilet at Gobowen train station has had a dramatic makeover – and won an award in the process.\nVisitors can spend a penny on the African plains, surrounded by giraffes, zebras, elephants, an orangutan and a lion – all in mural form, of course.\nThe quirky project came about as part of celebrations for Gobowen station’s 20th anniversary, which included the redecoration of the station’s office and waiting room.\nWhen it came to the toilet, however, Severn Dee Travel, which runs the station on behalf of travel company Arriva Trains, decided to draft in students from the neighbouring college to do something a little bit different.\nThe college provides residential FE for students with learning difficulties and disabilities, and has run the station’s café for the past four years, allowing students to practice real-life skills to prepare them for the world of work.\nCreative arts teacher Jane Carrington oversaw the project and guided students with the mural. Explaining the process, she said: “There was just one group of four students working on the mural. We spent four weeks designing it in the classroom, and then for two hours a week over 10 weeks, we were actually in the station painting.”\nThe somewhat unusual African savannah theme was suggested by a student, who was inspired by Jane’s time as an arts teacher in Botswana.\nJane said: “We were even going to plumb music into the loo as well, like an African choir – so you’re totally transported on this loo with a view. We wanted to buy a toilet seat with lions on it, and we talked about painting the floor – but we never got that far. Severn Dee were thrilled with any idea we’d come up with, it was just whether legally or health and safety-wise we could do it, really.”\nThe project, aptly named the ‘Loo with a View’, clearly impressed, scooping second place for the ‘community art project’ category in the annual Community Rail Awards. The station’s café was also recognised in the awards, taking first place in the ‘involving diverse groups’ section.\nThe Community Rail Awards, which began in 2005, aim to recognise the unsung heroes of the community rail world, and have their work and achievements recognised and rewarded. Awards on offer include everything from ‘best floral displays’ and ‘small projects award’ to ‘most enhanced station buildings’.\nPassengers have been quick to praise the new facilities at Gobowen station, with people who weren’t even travelling going out of their way to take a peek at the impressive mural.\nMartin Evans, finance director at Severn Dee Travel, said: “The toilet was basic. It was immaculately clean and well decorated, but we thought we’d do something different and see how we could improve it for our passengers.\n“We thought it would be a good idea if we could involve the students from Derwen, and now passengers that use the loo think it’s very impressive.”","Everyone's working remotely these days, yet security risks remain. Here are 10 ways you can combat online security threats.\nShare this article\nThere can’t be many businesses today that don’t use remote working to some extent throughout the working day. Even those without a culture or need to offer remote working will have employees or directors taking work home, or working from hotel suites, conference venues and public transport at times.\nThis more casual form of remote working, one that may not be accounted for when analysing how business IT networks are used, is often missed in cyber security policies and procedures. However, it is one important factor that can put organisations at risk of cyber attacks and data breaches.\nRemote working, whether a formalised arrangement between a business and an employee, or an ad hoc ‘needs must’ requirement to get work done, can leave your business IT network, systems and devices vulnerable.\nThe first step for managing security and remote workers is to understand where your business is at risk. This should be followed with an awareness raising campaign within the organisation so that all employees understand how their actions may compromise security and what steps they must take to protect company networks and systems.\nCyber security policies need to include the specific risks associated with remote working, with procedures and guidance in place for working away from the office. This will also need to explain what actions need to take place if a remote worker believes they have exposed the company to a cyber attack, and any disciplinary measures that may be taken.\nThe following top tips provide an excellent starting point:\n1. Keep mobile devices and laptops safe\nLost and stolen mobile devices and laptops are easy pickings for cyber criminals if insufficient security measures are in place. The first line of defence is to look after these business assets: keep them with you and in sight at all times, and never leave them in hotel safes, cars etc.\nNext up is securing the devices themselves with good password hygiene and encryption on laptops. Finally, installing mobile device management apps such as AirWatch and MaaS360 give employees a chance of securing and recovering lost mobiles or tablets.\nRemember: it's not just cyber crime that can disrupt your IT\n2. Excellent password hygiene\nStrong passwords will not only protect your devices and systems being accessed if a mobile or laptop is lost or stolen, they also protect businesses from hackers. Good password hygiene includes using long passwords with multi-characters, two-step authentication processes, and unique passwords for different systems and logins.\n3. Ensure up-to-date security protection is in place\nAny devices that are owned by the organisation should be properly protected with antivirus, web filtering, firewalls, device encryption and other preventative software, but so too should your employees’ own devices if they are using them for remote working.\nThis can be a difficult area to negotiate as your employee may feel this impinges on the personal use of their device: Your cyber security policies will need to address issues like these, either restricting staff from using their own devices for certain business critical activities, providing secure company owned devices, or making your cyber security protection mandatory.\n4. Use of public wifi\nPublic wifi can be vulnerable to malicious attack, presenting issues for those employees who may need to work from a hotel or conference. While it is good advice to only connect to trusted networks this is not always feasible.\nTherefore, your remote working / cyber security policy should stipulate that employees should not use public wifi for any sensitive, business critical activities. It is advisable to draw up some guidelines that explain what systems and activities staff can and cannot access when using public wifi.\n'Quick question Dave: where's all our money gone?\n5. Email encryption and best practice\nEmail is perhaps the most used digital technology by staff members who are away from the office, and one that can open a backdoor to cyber criminals. Encryption and robust management of corporate email is a must.\nThe installation of applications such as Mimecast is a no brainer, but raising awareness of the vulnerabilities of email will also help embed best practice in your organisation. This can include training in spotting cyber threats like phishing emails, and also policies on what information should not be communicated in an email – for example logins and passwords.\n6. Using public computers\nWhile the majority of people will have their own laptop or mobile device that they use for remote working, occasionally someone may need to use a public computer such as in a business suite in an airport.\nEmployees should be aware of the security implications of this and adhere to the following guidance: keep screens private (position them away from other people), don’t use public computers for any sensitive information, use ‘private browsing’ where possible, never use ‘remember me’ or ‘save information’, and clear your browsing history and delete any downloads before closing the browser.\n7. Using devices when out and about\nEmployees should also be aware of physical threats when using devices when in public places like cafes, hotels, airports etc. Just as you would hide your PIN when using an ATM, employees should be discreet when keying in passwords and logging into systems.\nThey should also be aware of the risk of snooping and eavesdropping, not just online, but also from other people in the vicinity. Can someone see and potentially grab a discreet photo of company sensitive information while they work in a public space?\n8. Removable devices\nUSB sticks and other removable devices can be a source of malware and should be checked first. Many conferences hand out USB sticks that may be infected, often unbeknown to the organisers. Also don’t allow anyone to plug in a USB device into your computer, for example to share information in a meeting. Always get your IT department to security check removable devices.\n9. Monitoring and policy enforcement\nTwenty four-seven network monitoring and security will help your organisation identify threats and monitor users on your networks. Remote workers and their mobile devices can be monitored using this solution to protect your organisation’s network.\n10. Negligence and accidental risks in the home\nEven when your employees are working from home using your secure VPN, VDI or remote desktop, there can be other risks that need to be considered. Children and pets can be a surprising threat.\nCats have a habit of jumping on computer keyboards and inquisitive minds might press a few keys when a laptop is unattended. These kinds of risks should be addressed in your remote working / security policies to ensure that your staff take every feasible step to protect your systems at all times."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:998f25ca-c23a-4b3a-ad36-697f35984771>","<urn:uuid:02598588-2ea6-4379-b2e0-6b47df581446>"],"error":null}
{"question":"As someone who works at a waste treatment facility, what are the environmental impacts of medical waste and pharmaceuticals in water systems?","answer":"Medical waste and pharmaceuticals have significant environmental impacts on water systems. Antibiotics and medications in septic systems can destroy beneficial bacteria needed for proper operation. Wastewater treatment plants cannot effectively remove many pharmaceutical compounds, which end up discharged into surface and ground water. Studies have shown that pharmaceuticals like diclofenac, a common anti-inflammatory drug, persist in the aquatic environment and are frequently found in wastewater effluents, surface waters, groundwaters, and even drinking water. These compounds can be toxic to aquatic organisms - for example, diclofenac has been shown to cause tissue damage in fish at concentrations as low as 1 μg/l, affecting their liver, kidneys and intestines.","context":["Proper Disposal of Medical Sharps & Prescription Medication\nWhat are sharps?\nSharps include hypodermic needles, pen needles, intravenous needles, lancets and other devices used to penetrate the skin to deliver medications or to obtain a blood specimen.\nThe dangers of needles in the trash\nAccording to the US Environmental Protection Agency, an estimated 8 million people use more than 3 billion needles, syringes and lancets at home every year. Some sharps users throw their used needles in the trash or flush them down the toilet. Used sharps left loose among other waste can hurt sanitation workers during collection rounds, at sorting and recycling facilities and at landfills. They can also become lodged in equipment, forcing workers to remove them by hand. Children, adults and even pets are also at risk for needle-stick injuries when sharps are disposed of improperly at home or in public settings. You can help prevent injury, infection and pollution by following these simple steps:\n- DO put sharps in an approved sharps container. Containers can be obtained through select pharmacies, trash collection providers and online companies. Fees vary, depending on the size of the container. Check with your pharmacist, garbage service or local municipality to see if they offer a mail-back program or other disposal service. As an alternative, place sharps in an empty coffee can or laundry detergent bottle. When the container is ¾ full, tape the lid down securely with duct or packing tape. Label the container with “MEDICAL WASTE –SHARPS” and place in trash receptacle.\n- DON’T put sharps containers in your recycling, garbage (unless packaged as described above) or green waste cans.\n- DON’T flush sharps down the toilet. They may end up in our beaches and riverbanks.\n- DON’T put sharps in bleach bottles, soda cans or bottles, juice bottles, glass containers or milk cartons.\n- DON’T bring sharps to medical facilities, laboratories, pharmacies, or to your doctor’s office.\nProper Drug Disposal\nImproper disposal of medications is a safety and environmental concern. Antibiotics and other medications in a septic system can destroy beneficial bacteria necessary for the system to operate. Wastewater treatment plants are not designed to remove or process many compounds found in medications that end up being discharged into our surface and ground water. This includes prescription drugs, over-the-counter medications, veterinary drugs, cosmetics and vitamins. Proper disposal of medications also helps to protect our community against prescription abuse, addiction, and accidental or intentional overdose.\n- DO call your city or county government’s household trash and recycling service and ask if a drug take-back program is available in your community. Kalamazoo County’s “RED MED BOX” program provides multiple locations where you can easily and properly dispose of unused medications including chemotherapy medications and controlled substances. Visit www.redmedbox.com for more information and locations. The Great Lakes Clean Water Organization’s “Yellow Jug” program also provides free disposal of certain medications at participating pharmacies. Visit www.greatlakescleanwater.org for more information.\nIf a drug take-back or collection program is not available:\n- Take your medications out of their original containers. For solid medications such as pills or capsules, add a small amount of water to dissolve them first.\n- Mix drugs with an undesirable substance such as cat litter or used coffee grounds. Put the mixture into a disposable container with a lid, such as an empty margarine tub or into a sealable bag.\n- Conceal or remove any personal information, including RX number, on the empty containers by covering it with black permanent marker or duct tape, or by scratching it off.\n- Place the sealed container with the mixture, and the empty drug containers, in the trash.\n- DON’T flush medications down the toilet or drain unless the label or accompanying patient information specifically instructs you to do so.\n- DON’T give unused medications to another person.\n- DON’T place in trash (unless processed as described above)\n- DON’T bring unwanted or expired medications to medical facilities, pharmacies or to your doctor’s office.","Impacts of the human pharmaceutical diclofenac in the aquatic environment\nMehinto, Alvine Coralie\nThesis or dissertation\nUniversity of Exeter\nReason for embargo\nThe data from two chapters are being used for publications.\nAn increasing number of pharmaceuticals have been found in the aquatic environment and the issue has become a human and environmental health concern. Many pharmaceuticals are not fully degraded in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) and are continuously released in the aquatic environment resulting in concentrations in the low µg/l range in the receiving waters. Diclofenac is a widely used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and is persistent in the aquatic environment. This pharmaceutical has been frequently reported in wastewater effluents, surface waters, groundwaters and even drinking water. NSAIDs are known to inhibit the cyclooxygenase activity, an enzyme present in many species of the animal kingdom responsible for the synthesis of prostanoids, and chronic exposure to environmental diclofenac may have detrimental effects on metabolism of non-target organisms including microbes and fish. In this thesis, microbiology, genomics and metabolomics approaches were used to investigate the effects of diclofenac on aquatic microbes and fish. In the first study of the thesis (chapter 3), the biodegradation of selected NSAIDs was investigated, together with their potential toxicity to aquatic microbes. Aerobic biodegradation experiments were conducted using activated sludge and wastewater effluents as microbial inocula and diclofenac, ketoprofen or naproxen as sole carbon source (1-10 mg/l) in order to isolate and identify the bacterial degraders. Changes in the bacterial populations were monitored by optical density and PCR-DGGE. The analytical techniques solid phase extraction (SPE) and ultraperformance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UPLC-TOF-MS) were optimised to quantify the pharmaceuticals in environmental samples. High recovery rates were obtained with 94% for diclofenac; 92% for ketoprofen and 85% for naproxen and with detection capabilities down to 3-7 ng/l. Results from the biodegradation experiments showed that ketoprofen and naproxen were eliminated at up to 99 and 55% respectively over a 40 days period. Consistently with previous studies, diclofenac showed no significant degradation. In all the enrichments, a significant decrease in the bacterial abundance was observed as a consequence of NSAIDs exposure and attempts to isolate the bacterial degrading populations were unsuccessful. Given the apparent micro-toxicity of these NSAIDs, the standardised test Microtox@ was carried out with Vibrio fischeri. The EC50 (15 min) estimated ranged from 13.5 mg/l + 2.3 for diclofenac to 42.1 mg/l + 3.9 for naproxen. Further toxicological tests were performed with diclofenac on bacterial strains isolated from activated sludge. Growth inhibitory effects were observed from 50-70 mg/l for Micrococcus luteus, Zoogloea ramigera and Comamonas denitrificans. Pseudomonas putida seemed more tolerant to diclofenac exposure and toxic effects were observed from 90 mg/l. These studies showed that diclofenac was the most toxic NSAID but toxicological effects in bacteria only occurred at concentrations at least 1,000 times higher than those found in the environment. However, chronic exposure to lower concentrations may cause similar interferences and affect the degradation potential of naturally occurring microbial populations. The second study (chapter 4) investigated the biological effects of sub-chronic exposure to waterborne diclofenac (0.5, 1, 5 and 25 µg/l) in female juvenile rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss. After 21-day exposure, mRNA expression levels of cytochrome p450 1a1 (cyp1a1), cyclooxygenase (cox) 1 and 2, and p53 were investigated in the liver, kidney and gills using RT-PCR and QPCR. These genes were selected as they are likely targets for diclofenac in mammals. Histopathological investigations were carried out in the small intestine, liver and kidney because diclofenac has been reported to induce toxicity responses in these tissues. Fish bile was also analysed by SPE and UPLC-TOF-MS to evaluate the bioconcentration potential of diclofenac and look for evidences of diclofenac metabolism. Results showed a significant reduction of both cox1 and cox2 expression in the liver, gills and kidney from 1 μg diclofenac/l. In contrast diclofenac induced an increase in mRNA levels for cyp1a1 in the liver and gills but a significant reduction of cyp1a1 expression in the kidney from 1 µg/l. There were no clear effects of diclofenac on the mRNA levels of p53. Diclofenac exposure caused tissue damages at exposure concentrations as low as 1 µg/l. Histopathological injuries included inflammation, hyperplasia and fusion of the villi in the small intestine and tubule necrosis in the kidney. There were no obvious changes in the liver of diclofenac-exposed fish. The analysis of bile revealed a bioconcentration potential between 509 + 27 and 657 + 25. A reactive metabolite of diclofenac was also detected at the highest exposure concentration which may be responsible for the severe injuries found in those fish. Sub-chronic exposure to environmental concentrations of diclofenac altered gene expression and it is possible that long term exposure to environmental diclofenac lead to significant impacts on fish health. In the final part of this thesis (chapters 5 and 6) effects on the metabolite composition of biofluids were analysed in diclofenac-exposed fish. This work entailed developing and validating appropriate methodologies to analyse fish bile and blood plasma. Methanol extraction and UPLC-TOF-MS were optimised to analyse the plasma metabolome but the methodologies were not suitable to detect low abundance molecules such as eicosanoids due to the interferences (ion suppression) in the samples matrix. Multivariate data analysis failed to detect the endogenous metabolites of the plasma affected by the chemical exposure. The only discriminating metabolite was found after analysis of the plasma samples from control vs. 25 µg/l treatment groups and identified as the exogenous compound diclofenac. To analyse the bile, the developed SPE methodology was carried out in order to separate the metabolites between a free steroids (fatty acids, eicosanoids, etc.) fraction and a conjugated steroids (bile salts) fraction. Due to high levels of taurocholic acid masking other metabolites in the conjugated fraction, some bile samples were hydrolysed to deconjugate these metabolites. The non-hydrolysed and hydrolysed bile fractions were analysed by UPLC-TOF-MS in positive and negative ionization. Multivariate data analysis using principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) revealed significant perturbations in the bile metabolite profile of diclofenac-exposed rainbow from the lowest exposure concentration (0.5 µg/l). Over 50 metabolites were elevated or reduced as a result of the 21-day exposure, suggesting that diclofenac affected several metabolic pathways. One metabolite was identified as a lipooxygenase product. This suggests that the inhibition of prostanoids synthesis can cause a shift in the arachidonic cascade and increase the synthesis of other eicosanoids. Most of the other discriminative metabolites remain unidentified and FT-MS analysis will be performed to obtain a structural identity. The metabolomics study further highlights the concern of environmental diclofenac in non-target organisms and the need to investigate the metabolic pathways affected.\nTyler, Charles R.\nPhD in Biological Sciences"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f77f2630-3125-45bd-9910-4a30fe28271b>","<urn:uuid:4341502c-bfba-44dc-b7a8-bbaef3ca3fe4>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What are the technical requirements for creating light trails in Photoshop, and what ethical considerations must be taken into account when editing documentary photographs?","answer":"Creating light trails in Photoshop requires specific technical steps: layering multiple images together, applying black layer masks, using the lighten blending mode, and painting with a white brush to reveal light trails. For boat light trails specifically, photos should be exposed at 30 seconds and stacked in order of light trail movement. Regarding ethical considerations, photo editing must follow strict guidelines: images must be used truthfully without misrepresenting situations, manipulation should not distort reality, high technical standards must be maintained, and the dignity of subjects must be respected. Additionally, if digital manipulation is used, it should only be for creative effect and not in a way that misleadingly distorts the reality of the situation depicted.","context":["You’ve just finished a photo shoot. But when you take a look at your photos, the light just isn’t right. Is it dull and boring? Don’t worry! You can create your own lighting effects in Adobe Photoshop.\nThis article will show you how to add cool Photoshop lighting effects to your images.\nHow to Stack Light Sources Together\nThis is not, strictly speaking, creating your own lighting effects in Photoshop. But layering different images together to create a longer stream of light is still an efficient tool.\nLayering also allows you to add several light flows into one image. This intensifies the light flow, which is useful when photographing light motion trails.\nThis technique is often used for car light trails. Today we’re going to look at how it can be applied to boat light trails.\nBoats won’t give you super fast speed lighting effects, like a car would. That means you’ll need to stack several images together. That way the light will flow continuously through the photo.\nCar light trails make for great stock images, if you’re wondering why you should learn this.\nHow to Choose the Location for Your Photos\nYou’ll need to choose a location where you know there will be a regular flow of boats. A popular location for that might be somewhere like Venice, but anywhere with boat traffic will work.\nCompose your photo, and begin taking your photos. You will need to lock your shutter to take photos continuously. That means using an external shutter release cable. And one that allows you to lock the shutter until you’re finished.\nAim to expose at 30 seconds per photo, and adjust your other setting accordingly. Now keep taking photos until you feel you have enough light trails to work with.\nImport the Images to Photoshop\nThe chances are you’ll have many photos, and some that have no light trail, or a light trail you don’t wish to use.\nGo through the images you have, and decide which ones you want to turn into light trails. One continuous light trail from a boat is likely to mean around 4 images, it might be more or maybe it’s less.\nNow you have these images, go ahead and import them into Photoshop.\nHow to Layer Your Images\nThe lighting effects that you’re going to produce requires some paintbrush work.\nLet’s look at how you layer the images to produce the final result.\n- Layer the images on top of each other. Aim to do this in the order that the light trail moves away from the camera.\n- Apply the black layer mask to your layer. This will hide it from view. Do this for all your layers, and you should be left with the background image.\n- Now you’re ready to reveal the light trails. The aim is to only paint in the light trail. In order to do this change the blending mode to lighten. Now only light areas of the image will be painted in.\n- You have used a black layer mask, so make sure you have a white paint brush to add in the lighting effects.\n- Now paint across the layer to reveal the light trail.\n- Repeat this on each layer, until you have one complete light trail through your image.\n- You can also add more than one boat light trail. As long as you have the images to do so, you can then repeat steps 1-6.\nHow to Add Lighting Effects to Your Image\nAnother way to add light trails to your photos is to simply create them using Photoshop. There are a number of approaches to do this.\nOne of the best is to use the paintbrush tool. Follow these steps to create your Photoshop light painting!\nCreate Your Light Path\n- Choose an image you feel will work well with added light streaks. This might be a portrait, or an architecture photo where you wish to frame the subject using this technique.\n- Once you have your image, import it into Photoshop.\n- Now create a blank layer, this is where you’ll create your streak of light.\n- Now select the pen tool. Create an interesting line using this tool, the anchor points can be used to manipulate the curvature of the line. To do this hold down the mouse and drag the anchor in your desired direction.\n- Once you are satisfied with your line it’s time to save it. To do this click the path tab, it’s next to layers and channels. Double click your path, and name it “light painting“.\nPaint the Path With a Brush\n- The next step is to get your brush ready. There are several preset brushes you can use. For this guide you can use preset 100. Now in the brush tip shape menu adjust the spacing of the brush. To do this use the slider at the bottom of the tab, and set it to 2%.\n- The brush is almost ready, but now you’ll want to select the shape dynamic. In this menu make sure pen pressure is selected.\n- Now you’re ready to paint, so return to the path tab and select your path. To the right of the path tab you’ll see a menu tab, and you’ll want to select this. Within this menu you’ll see an option to “stroke path”.\n- Now a new tab will appear. In this tab make sure you have the brush selected, and you select “simulate pen pressure”.\n- Your simulated light stroke is ready, but to make it look like light you’ll need to give it some glow. To do this select the layers menu.\nCustomise Your Lighting Effects\n- In the menu at the bottom of the screen you’ll see an fx tab, select this.\n- In the fx tab you’ll find the two options you need, outer and inner glow. Select the inner glow option.\n- You’ll see a square colour block, and you’ll want to change this to your desired colour. Do this either with the dropper tool, or by simply selecting a colour with the colour picker.\n- Now before closing the tab select the outer glow option, and repeat step 3.\nAdd More Streaks to Create Drama\n- Now to add more interest lets add some more streaks. Return to the path tab, and now you need to manipulate the path.\n- Press control on a PC or command on the Mac, and hover your mouse over the path. You’ll see the pointer has turned white, and not you can select an manipulate your anchor points.\n- Adjust the line slightly, avoid big adjustments. You’ll want the line to keep more or less the same direction. But perhaps finishing and ending at slightly different points.\n- Now your line is ready once again select the menu tab to the right of the path menu, and stroke the path.\n- Repeat steps 2-4 until you are happy with the light line you have painted.\nHow to Selectively Brighten Your Image\nUse Luminosity Masks\nAnother way to influence the lighting in your photos is to use luminosity masks. You can selectively target areas of your photo, and then either lighten or darken them.\nLuminosity masks are an excellent tool to work with, and you can see how they’re made by watching this video.\nAlternatively you can download the easy panel, where creation of these luminosity masks is done for you through an action.\nOnce you have your luminosity masks you can select them by switching to the channels tool. You’ll have various masks you can apply from light to dark.\n- Should you wish to only effect an area that’s bright select one of the light luminosity mask.\n- You’ll see the area is selected, and now only this area will be effected when you paint over it with a brush.\n- With a black layer mask, you can now use a white paint brush to reveal your selected effect only in the area you want to change.\nUse the Gradient Tool\nThere are images without a huge variety of bright and dark areas. But you’ll still want to selectively effect parts of your image.\nThis is where you can use the gradient tool to simulate a graduated filter. Apply this to a layer you have created. Click on your image, and drag a line from the area you don’t want affected, through the area you want to change.\nIf you start at the bottom of your photo, and drag the line up the graduated filter will be applied across the whole image, with the top being most effected.\nWhat Effects Can You Apply\nThere are any number of effects you can apply through Photoshop, and different ways they can be achieved.\n- Curves – These can be used to darken, lighten, or add more contrast to your photo. Go to Layers>New adjustment layers>Curves. Once you open this you’ll see a histogram, with a diagonal line running through it. You can manipulate this line by dragging it. Dragging the line up will brighten your photo. Dragging the line down will darken your photo, and giving the line an S-curve will add contrast. You can then selectively add these light effects to your photo.\n- Solid colour – In addition to brightening and darkening your image, you can also add the illusion of sun flare. This isn’t just about brightening the image, but also adding warmth to the area as well. To do this you’ll need to add a solid colour layer. So proceed to New fill layer>solid colours. You can then choose the colour. Use the colour picker to choose a warm colour, something that’s yellow or orange in hue. This layer will blank out your photo, so you’ll need to use a gradient tool to choose where you want the effect to be used. It’s also a good idea to adjust the fill of this layer, subtle effects are better here so adjust down to 10 or 20%.\nHow to Add Light Rays to Your Photos\nAdding light rays to your photo for more dramatic lighting effects is also something you can use Photoshop for.\nNormally you’d need some mist or smoke to achieve these kind of rays, which would mean waking up early in the morning.\nWith this tutorial you can add them at your leisure with post processing.\nPreparing Your Brush\n- Select the brush tool on the left hand menu.\n- Now on the right, select brush. This menu will allow you to manipulate the brush.\n- The first step is to select the shape dynamic tool. Then the increase the size jitter to around 50%.\n- Now move to the next option down, scattering. You’ll want to increase scattering to around 500%. When you do this you’ll notice the brush stroke at the bottom is becoming pixelated.\n- Finally come back to the brush tip shape. Here you’ll need to increase the spacing to around 100%, and finally increase the hardness to 100% as well.\n- The last step is to decrease the size of your brush, to perhaps 30 pixels.\nPainting Onto Your Image\n- Create a new layer, and make sure the foreground is set to white.\n- Now use your brush to pain some streaks coming out from the central point you want your rays to emerge from.\n- Once you have finished you’ll have a series of dots that spread out from a central area.\nCreating Your Light Rays\n- To do this you’ll need to utilise the filter options. Go to Filters>Blur>Radial Blur. Select radial blur, and a new menu will appear.\n- Once in this menu make sure you have the zoom effect selected, and increase this to 100%.\n- Now drag the square to select where within your image the zoom effect will be centered. This will take a little trial and error.\n- To intensify the effect of the rays you can duplicate the layer.\nThere are many ways to adjust your image in Photoshop. From creating your own to using Photoshop’s Lighting Effects filter (in Photoshop CS6 and Photoshop CC).\nIn this Photoshop tutorial, we’ve shown you several different approaches to creating lighting effects, so now you can start experimenting.\nDo you have a preferred method of adjusting your lighting in Photoshop?\nLeave your thoughts, and any images you wish to share in the comments section of this article.","In our use of images, we adhere to the following principles:\n1.

{"question":"cicd benefits","answer":"CI/CD benefits include reduced development time, fewer manual integrations, decreased administrative resources, significant cost savings in development, increased productivity and speed. It enables faster software releases that are reliable and of high quality through test automation and continuous service provision. Without CI/CD, software releases require long periods for manual deployments and testing, while a single mistake can restart the entire process.","context":["Agile is widely used in development environments, however, DevOps is required if continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) is to be adopted. In older times many teams may be unaware that much of the process from development coding to testing and ultimately production may be automated.\nAccording to AWS documentation, DevOps is a combination of cultural concepts, processes, and technologies that increase an organization’s ability to develop rapid applications and services: updating and improving products at a quicker rate than conventional management approaches. Implementing a CI/CD pipeline in the development environment eliminates confusion, and developers can maintain speedy delivery of fixes and updates during the software lifecycle, which was previously significantly slower due to the lack of automation.\nCI/CD is the Backbone of the DevOps Concept\nAgile is a concept that allows development and testing iterations in the software development process. Unlike the Waterfall approach, development and testing operations are carried out concurrently under this methodology. This procedure improves communication among clients, developers, managers, and testers.\nDevOps Methodology added automation to the SDLC process with the help of cloud computing and DevOps tools. Developers can use CI/CD to distribute software updates more quickly and lower the number of errors in design and specifications when presenting new modifications to stakeholders. Automation with CI/CD accelerates the process and can considerably shorten software development time.\nSo What is CI/CD?\nContinuous Integration and Continuous Delivery shortly CI/CD is the process of automating the SDLC process. Commonly referred to as the CI/CD pipeline it is a series of procedures that must be followed in order to deploy new software releases.\nIt gets the generated codes, deploys to development and test environments, and makes it easy to find and fix bugs in similar production environments that assist you in properly deploying a new version of the product. CI refers to continuous integration while CD is continuous delivery.\nContinuous integration is a software development technique in which code changes are integrated into a shared repository, then build and test phases are triggered and performed automatically. The primary aims of continuous integration are to find and resolve flaws quicker, improve software quality, and reduce the time it takes to verify and deploy new software updates.\nContinuous delivery is a technique that automates the creation, testing, and deployment of code changes. It stands for one step beyond continuous integration by deploying all code changes beyond the build step to a test or production environment. When continuous delivery is effectively implemented, developers will always have a deployment-ready build artifact that has passed a standardized test process.\nContinuous Delivery vs Continuous Deployment\nIf someone says CI/CD, they usually mean continuous delivery rather than continuous deployment. As it is explained in the previous section, Continuous Delivery is the technique of automatically pushing code updates into the “dev” and “test” (staging) environments so that the dev team can examine the product increment and QA testers can make their tests.\nContinuous Deployment is when code updates go beyond Continuous Delivery and are automatically deployed to the production environment on a regular basis. The presence of a manual approval process to move to production distinguishes continuous delivery from continuous deployment. Continuous deployment automates production and eliminates the need for explicit approval.\nHow to Implement CI/CD Pipeline\nMost development teams now use the DevOps approach, but there is no single way to execute CI/CD because most teams tailor the software automation to their specific needs and interests. The secret to effective CI/CD is to use the appropriate automation tools and methods. Developers must identify how to coordinate changes and select methods that work with the environment.\nTeams should implement CI/CD into the SDLC process through a combination of version control, build, test, orchestration, and configuration management tools.\nCI starts with centralized repositories, where the development team works on code using version control systems such as Git. A version control system (VCS) keeps track of every change and makes it easy to return when anything goes wrong. It also supports configuration as code, allowing teams to handle testing, infrastructure, and other components as versioned artifacts.\nCI build tools package files into deployable components. After passing unit test checks, CD tools deliver artifacts to the operations team for further testing and preparation.\nThe term “environment” refers to a deployment infrastructure such as “prod” (production), staging, or “dev” (development) for the deployable components. CI/CD pipeline builds, tests, and deploys code in contexts ranging from where developers write code to where operations teams make apps publicly available.\nAny CI/CD workflow relies heavily on testing. Automation facilitates effective CI/CD adoption. Tests must be done as quickly as feasible so that feedback reaches the developer as soon as possible. This enables the discovery of bugs at an early stage. The final result is a bug-free and more accurate application. All of this will be feasible only with test suite automation.\nIf all tests pass so the code components are regarded as ready for deployment in a production environment. It is transmitted to human stakeholders, authorized, and then deployed in a continuous delivery pipeline.\nSoftware configuration management is the work of tracking and regulating changes in software in software engineering, and it is part of the wider cross-disciplinary topic of configuration management. Configuration management is frequently used in conjunction with version control and CI/CD pipelines.\nBenefits of CI/CD\nIn an organization that doesn’t use DevOps methodology, the release of software requires a long time for manual deployments and testing, while a mistake that can stop the process can bring everything back to the beginning. In such an environment, due to the effort and time required to get code ready for release, changes are only delivered every few months or so.\nBut with DevOps, Continuous Integration and Delivery (CI/CD) pipelines automate the build, test, and deploy process and produce several advantages. When done effectively it may reduce development time, manual integrations, and administrative resources. Implementing CI/CD can save thousands of dollars in development costs. Here are the other benefits of CI/CD:\nProductivity and Speed\nWhat are the Best CI/CD Tools?\nDepending on your goals and, of course, your budget, CI/CD solutions are available in both free and paid models. You can develop your custom automation scripts, but using the correct tools is a lot more effective approach to dealing with automation. Jenkins, GitlabCI, Bamboo, TravisCI, CircleCI, and AWS CodePipeline are some of the most popular CI/CD tools.\nCI/CD tools are essential for organizing and automating the pipeline’s many steps, from starting the process after a commit to managing the build, triggering automated tests, publishing artifacts, and aggregating and relaying feedback. Once you’ve decided on a tool, it needs to be set up to work with your version control system.\nWithout DevOps tools, the deployment process is complex.

{"question":"What are the key differences between PPE challenges faced by female firefighters versus cancer prevention measures for all firefighters?","answer":"Female firefighters face issues with PPE sizing since about 80% experience problems with improperly fitting gear, which was designed for men's proportions rather than women's measurements. In contrast, all firefighters face PPE challenges related to cancer prevention, where even properly fitted gear doesn't offer total protection against carcinogens. While female firefighters need specialized sizing systems for their gear, all firefighters must follow specific PPE protocols including wearing SCBA through all fire stages, proper cleaning after fires, and keeping gear out of living areas to minimize cancer risks.","context":["Why Women in the Fire Service Need Better-Fitting Gear\nHave you ever tried on clothes only to find out you are no longer the size you thought you were? On a recent trip to Europe I was in a men’s clothing store looking to purchase a new suit. What I thought was my size—a large—turned out to be a supersized XXL in the European system. Yikes! Now take that experience and think of it the other way around. Imagine having to wear a coat or trousers two to three sizes larger than you need. That is similar to what many women in the fire service have had to face for decades when it comes to their personal protection equipment (PPE).\nAccording to the 2020 US Fire Department Profile report, there are nearly 90,000 female firefighters in the United States—that’s 9 percent of all firefighters in the US. Of that number, 17,200 were career and 72,400 were volunteer. Over the last 10 years the number of female firefighters has increased. Yet many women firefighters, especially in the volunteer fire service, end up being issued used gear that was designed for men.\nFinding the proper fit is about more than just sizing down. Most of the time, a women’s size is not just a smaller men’s size. Proportions are different and they need—and deserve—the right-fitting gear.\nWhy improper fits are more than just an inconvenience\nStudies dating back more than a decade have shown that as many as 80 percent of female firefighters experience issues with improperly fitting PPE.\nImproperly fitting gear—such as firefighter gloves, firefighter boots, bunker pants, and bunker coats—isn’t just a nuisance for women in the fire service, but it can also lead to injuries. Bunker pants that are too long or bulky, for instance, can lead to trips, falls, and an inability to move efficiently. Bunker coats that are too long can lead to injuries while using an axe or power equipment or advancing a hoseline. Four percent of firefighter injuries happen to women, according to the Fire Department Profile. This figure isn’t all due to poor-fitting gear, but that can certainly be a contributing factor.\nIn an interview published by NFPA Journal® in 2021, Dr. Meredith McQuerry, a Florida State University professor and expert in clothing comfort physiology, said female firefighters have a 33 percent higher risk of on-duty injury than their male counterparts. “Ill-fitting PPE is certainly playing a role in that greater risk of injury and even risk of fatality,” McQuerry told the magazine. “They’re not able to move as easily or as quickly as they need to. That puts them at greater risk.”\nWhat does the future of female firefighter PPE look like?\nSome very interesting research has been done by McQuerry that will help drive solutions to the problem of improperly fitting gear for female firefighters.\nWith support from the Fire Protection Research Foundation, the research affiliate of NFPA®, McQuerry and other researchers were able to recently create the first-ever database of female firefighter anthropometrics—a fancy way of describing a person’s physical measurements. With that data, which included measurements from nearly 200 female firefighters, McQuerry and her team hope to ultimately propose a sizing system for female firefighter PPE. That system could then be shared with and considered by manufacturers as well as the technical committees responsible for updating NFPA 1970, Standard on Protective Ensembles for Structural and Proximity Firefighting, Work Apparel and Open-Circuit Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) for Emergency Services, and Personal Alert Safety Systems (PASS).\n“Our ultimate goal is to propose female sizing systems for structural and wildland PPE, to share those with the fire service [and] to share those with manufacturers and standards bodies to create, hopefully, in tandem, real change for women in the fire service,” McQuerry said during a recent webinar hosted by NFPA. You can watch the full hour-and-a-half presentation in the “Archives” section of the NFPA Webinars webpage.","A job search firm, Career Cast, lists the occupation of firefighting as one of the Most Dangerous Jobs of 2015. Beyond the obvious risks of smoke inhalation and burns, what makes firefighting so dangerous? A 2008 study showed that 61.7% of firefighters received on-the-job injuries of fractures, sprains, or muscle injuries. Other injuries included wounds, fire or heat burns, chemical burns, respiratory problems, skin exposure, and heart attacks or strokes. While those types of physical injuries will heal over time, firefighters breathe in smoke on nearly every call. Smoke is filled with dangerous carcinogens that settle into the firefighter’s lungs and other organs, quietly setting the stage for cancer to take root. The short answer to whether firefighters are at risk of cancer is YES.\nStudies on Firefighters and Cancer\nA 2006 meta-analysis of 32 studies on Cancer Risk Among Firefighters proved that firefighting poses a strong risk of many types of cancer. The most prevalent types of cancer are Multiple myeloma, Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, prostate cancer, and testicular cancer.\nThe National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NOSH) has done the most comprehensive research on firefighters and cancer. The findings show that the long-term health of firefighters is seriously at risk.\nOther studies show similar results. Firefighters in Nordic countries, aged 30-40, were studied in 2014 and found to have a greater chance of prostate and skin cancers. Another study looked at male firefighters in Massachusetts from 1987-2003 and found greater odds of firefighters developing brain and colon cancer.\nSusan Shaw, executive director of the Marine & Environmental Research Institute and professor of environmental health sciences at the State University of New York in Albany, says that the long someone works as a firefighter, the greater the chance that they will develop some type of cancer. Shaw wondered why deaths due to cancer among the firefighting population were lower in the 1950’s than they are today and why rates have been climbing since then.\nCancer Linked to Toxins Caused by Flame Retardant Materials\nIf you compare the types of materials that were used in manufacturing during the 1950’s, you’ll find that they were made of wood, cloth, metal, and glass. Today’s furnishings and clothing are made of synthetic materials including plastic and foam. Chemically produced, or synthetic fibers, are joined together to make different types of fibers. When synthetics burn, they create a toxic haze, and firefighters breathe in carcinogens at the site of every fire call.\nTimothy Rebbeck, professor at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and the Harvard School of Public Health offers up an answer. He explains that every substance changes its chemical structure when it burns. As manufacturers increase the numbers of synthetic goods, fires become more toxic. Fire experts state that synthetic materials produce hundreds of time more smoke than natural materials. They also state that flame retardants double the amount of smoke and increase toxic gasses at 10 times the rate of organic materials. When a home catches fire, the lovely new sofa and matching drapes create a cancerous fog for fireman who try to save your home.\nHow Firefighters Protect Against Cancer\nMost firefighters willingly wear personal protective equipment (PPE), but equipment doesn’t offer total protection against cancer. During a fire call, the firefighter’s skin absorbs toxic chemicals that leak through the protective gear. Over time, the chemicals create health risks soon after the fire and can surface as cancer later on. Even for firefighters who “suit up” tightly, toxic vapors seep in and around the helmet and face-piece, as well as helmet ear covers, hoods, and coat and glove wristlets. Washing gear after a call can help, but harmful carcinogens can remain, even after washing.\nThe Firefighter Cancer Support Network and other advocates developed a helpful list with specific suggestions for using and caring for PPE, to decrease known exposures.\nThe list follows:\n1. Wear SCBA through all stages of the fire, including overhaul.\n2. Remove as much of the bulk contamination as possible while still at the fire scene by performing gross contamination.\n3. Wipe soot from your head, neck, jaw, throat, underarms and hands using wet wipes immediately after the fire.\n4. Change and wash station, work and other clothing right after returning to the station or leaving the fire-ground.\n5. Shower after the fire.\n6. Ensure that all gear is properly cleaned right after the fire.\n7. Do not transport or take contaminated clothing home or store in a vehicle.\n8. Keep all gear out of living and sleeping areas.\nThe Firefighter Cancer Support Network also recommends that firefighters always wear gear properly. This means wearing the hood, deploying the ear flaps, extending the collar fully, and securely fastening and overlapping all areas where gear joins together.\nDealing with Grief Over Firefighter Cancer and Death\nMost firefighters understand the risks of their occupations, but it doesn’t make the pain of learning about a cancer diagnosis any less painful. A firefighter who receives a diagnosis of cancer experiences shock and grief. None of that is easy, especially when it means long periods of radiation, chemotherapy, and possibly surgery. The sadness and grief is compounded by learning that their cancer may have had a better prognosis if they’d gotten screened sooner. Knowing this has motivated some firefighters and their families to lobby for earlier cancer screenings.\nGrief over any cancer diagnosis is a painstaking process. With the prevalence of cancer around the firehouse, firefighters grieve along with their peer firefighters, as one after another of then fight the cancer battle. Some of them will lose the battle. There will be families to console and funerals to attend. Over time, the high numbers of cancer victims and survivors take an emotional toll on even the toughest of firefighting stock of men and women.\nGetting Help Dealing with Cancer Diagnoses\nIt helps to understand feelings surrounding cancer by learning the different phases that occur when there is any serious illness. There is the phase before the diagnosis, the acute phase, the chronic phase, and recovery or death. Because of the prevalence of cancer among firefighters, many of them will have anticipatory grief—a normal kind of mourning that occurs when death or a serious illness is looming. Anticipatory grief causes depression, sadness, extreme concern, and mentally and emotionally preparing for serious illness or death.\nDealing with depression or strong emotional feelings when a firefighter goes on call is risky. Their thinking gets muddled and they are not as sharp or quick to react. Working in this state of mind creates an on-the-job safety hazard for the firefighter and peers, where thinking on their feet is the norm.\nAs important as it is for firefighters to take precautions to take care of their protective gear after a fire call, it’s equally important for them to take care of their health. That means talking about their fears about cancer and other duty-related hazards that cause emotional stress and depression. Firefighters don’t have to deal with these feelings alone. Frontline Responder Services can help.\nThe best place to start is by finding a qualified therapist that you feel you can trust. Frontline offers local resources to help you in your search for a therapist. Frontline performs a search by therapist location, specialization, gender, and age group treated. If we search by location, your results will include the therapists near you and will display their credentials, location, and the issues they treat. Some types of therapists that may list in our directory include:\n• Licensed Clinical Social Workers (LCSWs): LCSWs have had supervised clinical experience and often have backgrounds in sociology or social work. They may work as individual psychotherapists or in community and group settings.\n• Licensed Addiction Counselors (LACs): LACs are not typically referred to as therapists, but they may practice alongside therapists. A LAC will have, at minimum, a bachelor’s degree and one year of training in addiction counseling.\n• Licensed Marriage and Family Therapists (LMFTs): LMFTs focus primarily on marriage and family therapy. A LMFT will have a master’s degree and typically must complete an internship before practicing.\nThe studies are clear. All firefighters are at risk of getting cancer, in one form or another. Getting therapy for dealing with the cancer is just like putting on protective gear before racing to a call. It helps firefighters to know that the feelings they have are normal and have predictable phases and stages. Getting the right therapy in the right time is like making sure every exposed part of the body is covered.\nMark W Lamplugh Jr\nMark Lamplugh is a fourth-generation firefighter and former captain with the Lower Chichester (PA) Fire Company.

{"question":"What are the primary regulatory challenges for food companies in international markets excluding supply chain technology?","answer":"The primary regulatory challenges for food companies in international markets include food safety compliance across different countries (covering product quality, ingredients, labeling, and packaging requirements), anti-bribery and corruption laws (with 93% of compliance professionals expecting these risks to stay the same or worsen), environmental regulations (regarding emissions, waste disposal, water use, and GMOs), employment laws (varying by country and covering wages, working conditions, and employee rights), trade regulations (affecting imports/exports and tariffs), and advertising laws (governing product marketing). Compliance failures in these areas can result in significant penalties, as exemplified by Mondelez's $13 million FCPA violation settlement, and can damage company reputation.","context":["Third-Parties Pose Serious Corruption Risk\nSeeking to grow the company and develop new markets, Mondelez International Inc. (then Kraft Foods) took over confectioner Cadbury in February 2010. Less than a year later, a whistleblower contacted the SEC, alleging a consultant for Cadbury subsidiary Cadbury India bribed government officials and possibly top state politicians to obtain licenses and approvals for expansion of a chocolate factory in Baddi, Himachal Pradesh.\nA seven-year battle ensued, and in January of 2017, the SEC charged Mondelez with violating the FCPA’s books and records and internal controls provisions. Mondelez agreed to pay $13 million in penalties.\nRegulatory agencies around the world are holding organizations accountable for the illicit actions of the third parties they engage with. Professionals surveyed for the eighth annual Anti-Bribery and Corruption (ABC) Benchmarking Report, a study conducted jointly by Kroll and the Ethisphere Institute, put third-party violations of anti-bribery and corruption laws at the top of the list of perceived compliance risks.\nWhat’s more, an overwhelming majority of compliance professionals (93 percent) believe their ABC risks will stay the same or worsen in 2018. Heightened enforcement of existing regulations is their key concern, followed by new regulations.\nOne urgent challenge is the regulatory mandate for companies to understand the beneficial ownership structure of third-party partners or acquisition targets — an area that has become increasingly opaque. Third-party issues are the driving force behind 90 percent of the bribery and enforcement actions brought forward in recent years.\nBut where obtaining corporate ownership records used to be a straightforward exercise, now there might be layers upon layers of shell companies and holding companies obscuring the identity of whomever is calling the shots.\n“In reality there could be a nefarious individual who’s controlling the day-to-day activities or who has established and funded the organization for personal gains or influences,” said John Arvanitis, an associate managing director in Kroll’s compliance practice. “This is probably one of the biggest conundrums that compliance professionals face today throughout the world.”\nArvanitis said face time with third parties is advantageous for risk and compliance managers.\n“Everyone has a sixth sense,” he said. “If you sit across the table and have a conversation with somebody, you can flush out the type of information that would lead you to believe that an individual is ethical and wants to do business in the same manner as your organization.”\n“In reality there could be a nefarious individual who’s controlling the day-to-day activities or who has established and funded the organization for personal gains or influences.” — John Arvanitis, associate managing director, compliance practice, Kroll\nWhen it’s warranted, inviting your third party to bring along members of their supply chain can further illuminate how they do business, he added.\nThe difficulty in broadly applying that strategy becomes clear when you consider at least 45 percent of survey respondents work with more than 1,000 third parties in the course of a year. Some engage with far more. It’s likely this is why less than 25 percent of respondents felt highly confident in their program’s ability to address beneficial ownership risks.\nBuilding Strong Programs\nAt least 58 percent of respondents uncovered legal, ethical or compliance issues with a third party after initial due diligence, which is why ongoing monitoring, including a regular refresh of underlying third-party data, emerged in the findings as a key strategy for maintaining the effectiveness of anti-bribery and corruption programs and for keeping up with potential ownership changes.\nThe ABC Benchmarking Report found that 75 percent of respondents monitor some or all of their third parties. Fifty-six percent of respondents whose organizations conduct monitoring choose to refresh third-party data.\nOn an encouraging note, 36 percent of respondents indicated their organization dedicated more resources to ABC issues in 2017 than in 2016. In addition, 92 percent of all survey respondents said their leadership team is highly engaged or somewhat engaged in their ABC efforts.\nMultinational companies must elevate their level of focus on anti-bribery and anti-corruption efforts, especially when operating in locations that could be prone to questionable behaviors. Measures to weave into an ABC program include:\n- Developing an anti-corruption policy tailored to the organizations strategic goals as well as integrity and ethical goals.\n- Assessing and monitoring the level of corruption risk in each country the company does business in.\n- Communicating ethical standards and anti-bribery and corruption policies internally and with all third parties.\n- Thoroughly verifying the track record of third-party providers, local agents, distributors or intermediaries.\n- Training the local management and employees on anti-corruption policies.\n- Having a plan in place to monitor that the policies are being properly followed, including third-party contracts.\n- Regularly refreshing data collected on third-party providers, local agents, distributors or intermediaries.\nThere’s no such thing as an out-of-the-box solution for ABC programs, said Arvanitis. But there are underlying elements that matter.\n“What makes up an effective compliance program are quality people who are hardworking, who are ethical, who make a commitment and are dedicated to the compliance mission,” he said. Strong people and processes, combined with technological solutions, form the basis for a successful program.\nHaving a direct and impactful code of conduct that addresses the organization’s commitment to anti-bribery and corruption is imperative, he added, together with clear anti-corruption policies, a robust due diligence and third-party management program, as well as “a tone-from-the-top message that’s consistently provided and executed by the C-suite members,” said Arvanitis.\nDownload the full report. &","Before we dive deep into the PESTEL analysis, let’s get the business overview of Nestle. Nestlé S.A. is a Swiss multinational food and beverage company considered one of the largest in the world. Here is a brief overview of their business:\nFoundation and History: Nestlé was founded in 1866 by Henri Nestlé in Vevey, Switzerland.

{"question":"How to create textured walls sustainably?","answer":"Textured walls can be created using tissue paper techniques including faux leather effects, rustic textures, pattern stamping, and decoupage. For environmental sustainability, these should be implemented using materials with low VOCs, water-based adhesives instead of solvent-based ones, and natural cleaning products like vinegar, baking soda, or lemon juice for maintenance. The process involves applying tissue paper to walls with satin latex paint as a base, and can include techniques like crinkling, layering, and stamping. To maintain environmental responsibility, consider using locally sourced materials to reduce transportation energy costs and CO2 emissions.","context":["Faux painting techniques using tissue paper provide decorative ways to enliven ordinary walls and hide existing blemishes. Tissue-paper techniques can replicate other surfaces, such as leather and stone, or can transform your walls to look like an Old-World European home that is richly textured, rustic and warm. Tissue paper is versatile; it can be directly applied to your walls or layered, stamped and painted to look like a beautiful collage, creating a dramatic effect.\nFaux leather walls can turn a monotonous room into a handsomely textured, warm and inviting environment. Leather conveys a natural charm that is particularly desirable in the home. This effect is achieved by simply crinkling up tissue paper, opening it up and flattening it and then applying it directly onto your walls. The texture of the tissue paper replicates the look and feel of leather with lines, veins and creases. It is essential to apply the tissue paper to a wet wall, one wall at a time, and preferably with a base of satin latex paint, which functions as a glue. Overlapping and layering the edges of the tissue creates a blended and cohesive application. Deep sienna or mahogany brown will create a rich leather color for your application paint, and a top coat mixed in a ratio of two-thirds paint and one-third glaze will add a reflective sheen.\nRustic walls add character, history and texture to any room. This effect is created by crinkling a large piece of tissue paper in your hand and keeping it crinkled without flattening it. This is similar to sponge painting, but the crumpled-up tissue paper will be your primary tool for application, creating a more dramatic texture. Dabbing and pouncing the crumpled tissue paper onto your wet painted walls will create an effect that will be uneven, with small lines and imperfections that imitate Old-World walls. Use a soft bristle brush to gently smooth and blend the texture until it looks the way you imagined. Adding a third or even a fourth color of paint will add contrast and depth to this subtle blending and layering process.\nTheme Pattern Stamping\nPattern stamping is a beautiful way to transform an ordinary room into a space that incorporates more character. For example, stamping a pattern of leaves, bamboo or twigs onto your walls can rejuvenate a room, giving it a natural feeling. Once you have settled on your favorite theme and pattern, your tissue paper will become your canvas for as many stamps as you like. You stamp the tissue paper directly, and then apply the stamped tissue paper directly to your walls. For this technique, choose a lighter satin base paint for your application coat and a darker ink for your stamping so your pattern doesn't become diluted.\nDecoupage can enhance a traditional wall, an old coffee table or any surface that acrylic latex glue or paint can bond to. Think of this process like creating a collage in which you apply and layer your collection of different colored tissue papers. You can choose to crinkle the tissue, tear it into pieces or apply it flat; the layering and overlapping of the different colors and patterns creates the desired effect. You can finish it with a clear coat of acrylic glaze or add a smidgen of paint to your glaze to create an overall blended color.\n- Photodisc/Photodisc/Getty Images","Reduce. Reuse. Recycle. Respect.\nThe World Floor Covering Association (WFCA) teamed up with The Learning Channel’s Designing Spaces to produce a segment on green, environmentally friendly floors. It’s a great introduction to the concept of green flooring and to some of the choices available to eco-friendly homeowners.\nFor many of us, awareness of our individual impact on the life of our planet is just coming into focus. Recent initiatives by local utility companies, local builders and local and national governmental agencies have served to heighten awareness of every human being’s impact on the global environment. “Greening” our homes is a wonderful investment. The impact can be felt immediately within our own families and what’s good for us is good for our planet and future generations.\nGoing green, according to the U.S. Green Building Council, means looking at these factors when building or remodeling our homes:\n- Energy savings\n- Water efficiency\n- CO2 emissions reduction\n- Improved indoor environmental quality\n- Stewardship of resources and sensitivity to their impacts.\nSaving energy may mean choosing a natural flooring that requires little energy to produce; buying locally so that transportation energy is minimal; choosing flooring with no or low VOC (Volatile Organic Compounds) emissions because they can contribute to health problems; or choosing flooring that is made from renewable resources.\nEvery little step counts. And rest assured there are many flooring choices that will contribute to the notion of leaving our planet just as beautiful as it was when we arrived, so that our children and our children’s children can enjoy it as much as we did.\nWorld Floor Covering Association and “Designing Spaces” Provide Tips on Creating Eco-Friendly Living Spaces\nEver wonder what makes a product “green”?\nGet all of the answers you need and more by tuning into The Learning Channel’s Designing Spaces cable program which features the World Floor Covering Association (WFCA) in a segment on green, environmentally friendly floors. You'll get an overview of every kind of eco-friendly flooring on the market from carpets made of corn sugar to bamboo area rugs. And, you can learn about what makes a product environmentally friendly as well as the carbon “footprint” a product leaves from the time and place it is sourced to final installation.\nClearly, going green goes beyond just choosing a green flooring type. Cleaning products, transportation and materials used for manufacturing and installation must be considered.\nGreen Tips for Adhesives:\n- Choose products with low to no VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds)\n- Avoid formaldehyde\n- Look for Carpet and Rug Institutes (CRI) Green Label® or Green Label Plus® certification\nGreen Tips for Cleaners:\n- Choose products with natural and biodegradable ingredients\n- Consider homemade cleaners using things from the pantry: vinegar, baking soda, salt, lemon juice, rubbing alcohol, ammonia, or olive oil\nGreen Tips for the Whole House:\n- Keep caulked areas caulked (caulking prevents the loss of heat or cold air)\n- If you are installing a new floor, make sure that space between the flooring and the door is just right (too much space means you’re heating or cooling the entire outdoors while too little space means you can’t close the door)\n- Consider that space heaters are energy hogs and can generate more than two pounds of greenhouse gas per hour (use them too much and they might make your hardwood floors contract)\n- Choose low or no VOC products whenever you can\n- Insulation is not just for the attic anymore, it can be added between floors for additional savings\n- Choose a retailer that shares your commitment to the environment and knows about all the latest advances in green products\nGreen flooring falls into at least one of these categories:\n- Sustainable (wood flooring)\n- Eco-friendly (bamboo area rugs)\n- Contains recycled content (rubber flooring)\n- Recyclable (vinyl flooring)\n- Leaves a small carbon footprint (wool carpeting)\n- Has low VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds) (stone) It’s a matter of degree.\nWool, wood, fast growing bamboo, eucalyptus and cork are considered renewable resources because they can be re-grown and sustainably harvested.\nRecycled wood flooring is made from salvaged boards from old buildings slated for demolition or trees salvaged from lake bottoms that have been re-milled into a product suitable for your home.\nRecycled plastics from water and soda bottles can be added to the five billion pounds of carpet that is replaced annually and made into new carpet with all the attributes of virgin carpet.\nSalvaged or Reusable Materials\nOld stone floors can be salvaged and reused in a new setting.\nOther Green Factors\nSave transportation energy costs and reduce CO2 emissions by choosing products made or grown within 500 miles.\nVOCs are human-made chemicals that are used and produced in the manufacture of paints, industrial solvents, paint thinners and adhesives, among many other things.

{"question":"Can you please explain what happens physiologically during a traumatic brain injury and how it affects brain networks?","answer":"During a traumatic brain injury, a bump, blow, or jolt to the head disrupts normal brain function. At the cellular level, there is microscopic damage throughout the brain that initiates a cascade of biochemical events. The injury particularly affects the connection between gray and white brain matter due to their different densities - the softer, lighter gray matter moves more than the dense, heavy white matter during impact. This causes shearing of axons (nerve fibers) that connect these regions, leading to communication breakdown between brain cells. Over time, these torn axons deteriorate until they can no longer transmit information between gray and white matter. The damage can persist and alter brain structure and function long-term, affecting multiple brain networks and potentially leading to cognitive deficits, motor problems, and increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's.","context":["Do Reprogrammed Brain Cells Hold the Key to Healing Damaged Networks After Traumatic Brain Injury?\nDoris Lam | 21-LW-014\nTraumatic brain injury (TBI) has become the signature wound for military personnel. Moreover, there are many sources of TBI including improvised explosive devices, combat, motor-vehicle accidents, and more. The predominant number (82%) of documented TBI cases in military personnel are of the mild form, allowing individuals to return to active duty following a period of recovery. TBI, however, is not a single-injury event; tissue damage persists and can alter brain structure and function long term (i.e., months to years), even after military personnel have been deemed recovered and returned to duty. Still, treatment options for TBI remain scarce and are limited to rehabilitation and pharmaceutical interventions to adapt to the TBI-induced disability (e.g., cognitive and motor deficits). Thus, there is still a large need for technological advancement to better understand changes in brain function following TBI. There is also a large need for screening of potential therapeutics that will provide the bioresilience needed to treat active-duty personnel, repair TBI-induced disability, and prevent late-onset TBI-induced neurodegenerative diseases.\nCell-based therapies, stem-cell transplantation, and, more recently, in vivo astrocyte reprogramming are attractive therapeutic approaches for treating TBI-related pathophysiology. Initial studies demonstrate the potential for neuroprotection and tissue repair at the site of injury/disease in preclinical models of neurodegenerative diseases and stroke and promoting some degree of functional recovery in cognitive and motor behavior in in vivo models. However, the lack of clinical translation of cell-based therapies for neurological disease may be due to inadequate understanding of whether these treatments resolve circuit abnormalities (from a collection of networks) leading to functional improvement, or simply replace cells. Further investigation is needed to understand whether these new neurons (from reprogrammed astrocytes) can form neuronal networks that have the potential to repair brain activity, back to pre-injury levels of activity, that are left damaged or dysfunctional following TBI.\nOur project has used a novel experimental conceptual framework that combines methodologies, including in vitro technologies (e.g., 2D multi-electrode arrays [MEAs]), (Doris Lam et al. 2022), computational tools (e.g., graph-based models) and complementary cellular assays (Doris Lam et al. 2022), to assess the functional state of neurons from reprogrammed astrocytes under a healthy and reactive state and the development and maturation of their networks. The results of our project demonstrate we can chemically reprogram astrocytes into neurons, track the transformation and development of these cells for a prolonged period of time (i.e., two months), and reliably record neural-network activity over the course of days, weeks, or months. Further, we have developed complementary computational tools to identify the functional phenotype of the neurons (e.g., excitatory and inhibitory neurons), which is important in understanding healthy and pathological brain activity.\nThe significance of our findings evaluates whether a novel therapeutic approach (e.g., astrocyte reprogramming) is capable of repairing TBI-induced changes in brain activity, addressing the critical need to protect and treat active-duty personnel who are at high risk of TBI. Astrocyte reprogramming is a therapeutic approach and potential solution to treating TBI that has gained attention in recent years in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, with the goal of replacing the loss of neurons by reprogramming astrocytes into neurons. This is an attractive approach for TBI; however, the lack of clinical translation for this therapy may be due to inadequate understanding of whether brain-activity abnormalities are repaired. Here we address whether reprogrammed astrocytes can form neural-network activity and if reprogramming is specific. That is, does chemical reprogramming equally affect healthy and TBI-induced reactive astrocytes or is it more selective in reprogramming reactive astrocytes? Having demonstrated the efficacy and selectivity of chemical reprogramming of astrocytes, future studies will need to examine whether these reprogrammed cells can restore circuit structure and brain activity, allowing military personnel to return to active duty following TBI with no further risk, or does the approach alter circuit structure to restore activity. The latter, a temporary compensation mechanism, may require further monitoring of injured military personnel to see whether they are at risk of long-term neurological and psychological consequences. Our long-term goal is to use this novel experimental conceptual framework (i.e., human-relevant MEA platform and computational tools) to meet future national-security challenges, screening for novel and existing drug candidates (e.g., neuroregenerative drugs) for brain-related diseases and injury. LLNL has ongoing efforts and strong capabilities in high-performance computing (HPC) and machine-learning tools to speed up drug discovery for cancer and neurotoxicants, and actively participates in the Accelerating Therapeutic Opportunities for Medicine (ATOM) consortium. Future efforts will identify drug candidates using HPC and machine-learning tools during the early drug-discovery phase (e.g., to predict safety, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy) and down select promising candidates that can be screened on our human-relevant brain MPS, with the goal of accelerating the \"bench-to-bedside\" drug-discovery process for TBI, which aligns with both DOE and NNSA missions.\nPublications, Presentations, and Patents\nLam, D. et al. 2021. \"Do Reprogrammed Brain Cells Hold the Key to Healing Damaged Networks after Traumatic Brain Injury?\" Journal of Neurotrauma 38, no. 14: A70 (2021).\nLam, D. et al. 2021. \"Functional Assessment of a Novel 3D Human Brain-on-a-Chip System.\" Presentation, NASA Human Research Program Investigators' Workshop.

It’s important to identify traumatic brain injury symptoms as soon as possible to avoid worsening the condition.\nDefinition of Traumatic Brain Injury:\nA traumatic brain injury is caused by a bump, blow or jolt to the head. This trauma or head injury disrupts the brain’s normal ability to function. Not all blows or jolts to the head result in a traumatic brain injury.\nThe severity of a brain injury can be “mild,” which could be a brief change in mental status. Or a brain injury could be “severe,” which could be an extended period of unconsciousness or amnesia. Most traumatic brain injuries are concussions.\nWhat is a Concussion? Is it a Traumatic Brain Injury?\nA concussion is defined by the United States Center for Disease Control. They say a concussion is a type of traumatic brain injury, caused by a bump, blow, or jolt to the head. Concussions can change the way your brain normally functions. They can occur from a motor vehicle accident or a fall. Or they can even be sustained when a force causes the head and brain to move quickly back and forth without the head itself experiencing trauma.\nTraumatic brain injuries can cause a wide range of functional short-term or long-term changes. These traumatic brain injury symptoms could be changes that affect thinking, sensation, language, and sometimes emotions.\nTraumatic Brain Injury Symptoms can Affect The Following Brain Functions:\n- Thinking: which is described as memory and reasoning. Sometimes it’s short term memory or long term memory. Reasoning can be a lack of judgment.\n- Sensation: which is a change, or a loss of touch, taste, hearing, smell, or vision.\n- Language: which is a change in the ability to understand language; or a loss of expression or difficulty in communicating.\n- Emotions: which can be newly acquired depression, anxiety, aggression, acting out, social inappropriateness, or personality changes.\n- Other Risks: some brain injuries cause epilepsy, increase the risk for Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, or other brain disorders that develop years later.\nMultiple Mild Traumatic Brain Injuries Over Time can Cause Cumulative Cognitive Losses\nWe’ve all heard about professional boxers, hockey players, and football players having long-term brain damage from repeated head trauma. Multiple mild traumatic brain injuries that occur over an extended period of time can cause cumulative neurological and cognitive losses. – Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Sports-related recurrent brain injuries—United States. MMWR 1997;46(10):224–227.\nMild traumatic brain injuries are a result of microscopic damage throughout the brain that initiates a cascade of biochemical events that leads to the subsequent formation of Alzheimer’s-like plaques. – World Alzheimer Congress 2000. American Journal of Epidemiology.\nHere’s the Bottom Line: Any Concussion is an Injury to the Brain\nAny concussion is an injury to the brain. Some brain injuries are very minor. Others are quite severe. We also know that repetitive concussions lead to severe loss of brain function over time.\nLeading Causes of Traumatic Brain Injuries:\n- Falls (35.2%)\n- Motor vehicle traffic accidents (17.3%)\n- Struck by/against events (16.5%)\n- Assaults (10%)\nFalls are the Leading Cause of Traumatic Brain Injuries\nFalls cause 35.2% of aLl traumatic brain injuries. They also cause half (50%) of the brain injuries among children age 0 to 14 years old. Falls cause a whopping 61% of all the brain injuries in adults 65+ years old.\nMotor Vehicle Crashes or Auto Accidents are the 2nd Leading Cause of Traumatic Brain Injuries\nCar crashes are the second leading cause of brain injuries at 17.3%. Automobile accidents cause the largest percentage of brain-injury-related deaths at 31.8%. – Faul M, Xu L, Wald MM, Coronado VG. Traumatic brain injury in the United States: emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and deaths. Atlanta (GA): Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control; 2010\nPhysical Trauma is Not the Only Cause of Brain Injuries:\nTrauma, falls, car accidents, contact sports, and acceleration/deceleration are the most common physical causes of brain injuries.\nChemical Exposure Causes Brain Injuries:\nAfter trauma, the second largest cause of brain injuries is chemical exposures. This includes things like carbon monoxide poisoning and dangerous neurotoxins such as lead, solvents, and insecticides.\nLack of Oxygen Causes Brain Injuries:\nLack of oxygen is the next largest cause of brain injuries. They range from birth injuries, which is commonly known as cerebral palsy. Cerebral palsy, (CP,) is caused by medical mistakes. It is not a disease, virus, or birth defect. Cerebral palsy is usually quite preventable.\nProper monitoring of an infant in the womb can show stress or lack of oxygen. If the doctors act quickly, the child will be fine. But any delay in recognizing the stress of the child will cause permanent brain injury.\nStrokes Cause Brain Injuries:\nStroke is next on the list of brain injuries causes. When blood flow is blocked to the brain, causing a lack of oxygen, some brain cells will die. Or an internal brain bleed can quickly damage brain cells.\nOpen-Head Injuries Affect the Brain:\nOpen head injuries are next on the list for causes of brain injuries. When the skull is penetrated or fractured from violence, such as a gunshot wound, or fragments from an explosion or a high-speed motor vehicle crash, it will cause serious brain injuries.\nClosed-Head Mild Traumatic Brain Injuries:\nClosed-head injuries are when the trauma does not fracture the skull, but the brain is damaged by a sudden shaking or movement of the brain within the skull. If a person’s head and brain experience a sudden shake or jolt, they will have, what is commonly called, an “Axonal Shearing Injury.”\nAxonal shearing injuries occur when the axons, very small nerves connecting the white and gray brain matter, are stretched and damaged.\nDensity of Gray Versus White Brain Matter\nYour brain is made up of two types of brain cells: gray and white matter. The center of your brain is “white brain matter.” White brain matter is dense and heavy, while the surrounding gray brain matter is much softer and lighter.\nWhite and gray matter are connected by axons, which are billions of microscopic nerve fibers. Axons transfer information from the gray brain matter to the white brain matter, and vice versa.\nWhat are Axons and What do they do?\nAxons are the long, slender highways of brain nerve cells. Axons are key in sending signals within, to and from the brain. They transmit the impulse from one nerve cell to the and next from gray to white brain cells.\nHow Sudden Acceleration or Deceleration Causes Brain Injuries:\nTo understand how brain injuries occur from sudden acceleration or deceleration, let’s think about Newton’s laws of physics. One of Newton’s laws says that “objects in motion will stay in motion, and objects at rest will stay at rest until another force acts upon them.” Since our brains are soft and made of two different tissues, white matter and gray matter, when our head is hit, the skull moves as a direct result of the force. But the brain remains still and unmoved until the force causes the brain to move and catch up with the skull.\nThe Differences in the Mass of Gray and White Matter Causes them to Move at Different Speeds:\nMore importantly, the gray matter, which is softer and lighter, moves and stretches more than the dense, heavy white brain matter. So, the connections between the gray and white matter tears since the gray moves more than the white. The tearing between the two types of brain cells is called shearing.\nThe difference in the mass, or weight and density of the gray and white matter, causes shearing of the axonal nerve connections. Remember, axons are the micro, small nerve fibers that connect the two parts of the brain. The axons help the gray and white matter communicate with each other.\nStretching of the Axons Causes them to Deteriorate Until they Can’t Communicate between Gray and White Matter Anymore\nWhen the axons are stretched or sheared, they suffer micro tears. Over time, the tears to the axon cells don’t heal. Rather, they begin to deteriorate and breakdown until the axons are no longer able to communication information between gray and white brain cells connected by that specific axon.\nScientists used to be puzzled by the fact that brains could be injured in places other than the outer edges of the brain close to the skull. But, now we understand that the different densities of the gray and white brain tissue cause them to move more or less than the other. Because of the differences in their inertial characteristics, gray matter moves more than white matter.\nTherefore, there can be damage where the gray and white matter connects by one part moving more than the other. This is why we find damaged brain cells in areas where the gray and white meet instead of only the outer edges of the brain.\nMild, Moderate, and Serious Traumatic Brain Injuries\n75% of brain injuries are classified as “mild” brain injuries. However, the definition is not very comforting if you are the one with the “mild brain injury.”\nMany emergency department doctors call a concussion a “mild” brain injury because concussions are usually not life-threatening. Even though a concussion is not usually a life-ending injury, it can have a life-altering effect.\nWhat to do Immediately After a Traumatic Brain Injury\n- Get to an Emergency Room immediately. Traumatic brain injury symptoms get worse over the first 24 hours. This is because traumatic brain injury symptoms are often a cascade of events that take some time to manifest.\n- If a Person Goes to the ER and they are Sent Home, but Seem to be Getting Worse, Return to the Same ER immediately. This allows the same ER assess the changes. Don’t wait for a doctor’s appointment days later.\nYou may recall when Natasha Richardson, who fell and hit her head while skiing with her family in Canada. She initially said she felt fine and didn’t show any signs of injury. The ski resort followed emergency protocol and escorted Richardson back to her hotel and recommend she see a doctor. But she refused.\nAlthough no one is quite sure whether or not she lost consciousness, an hour later she started feeling poorly and developed a headache. Her condition worsened. Within 48 hours of her fall, she died of an epidural hematoma (internal bleeding.)\nShe did not realize she was bleeding internally in her skull, which was putting pressure on her brain. The pressure became so great, that it caused her to die. So, even a simple blow to the head without loss of consciousness can lead to death.\nCommon Traumatic Brain Injury Symptoms & Signs:\n- Head Pain\n- Nausea Near the Time of Trauma\n- Any Loss of Consciousness\n- Lightheadedness or Dizziness\n- Blurred Vision or Tired Eyes\n- Ringing in the Ears\n- Bad Taste in Mouth\n- Fatigue or Lethargy\n- Change in Sleep Patterns\n- Behavioral or Mood Changes\n- Trouble with Memory, Concentration, Attention, or Thinking\nModerate or Severe Traumatic Brain Injury Symptoms:\n- A Headache that gets Worse or Doesn’t Go Away\n- Repeated Vomiting or Nausea\n- Convulsions or Seizures\n- Inability to Awaken from Sleep\n- Dilation of One or Both Pupils of the Eyes\n- Slurred Speech\n- Weakness or Numbness in the Extremities\n- Loss of Coordination\n- Increased Confusion, Restlessness, or Agitation\nTraumatic Brain Injury Symptoms in Mental Disturbances:\n- Attention Problems\n- Memory Problems\n- Speed of Information Processing\n- Speech or Language Problems\n- Mental Organization\n- Task Efficiency\n- Executive Functions\nPhysical Signs of Traumatic Brain Injury Symptoms:\n- Sleep Disturbance\n- Lack of Energy\n- Ringing in the Ears\n- Blurred Vision\nBehavioral Changes in Traumatic Brain Injury Symptoms:\n- Angry Outbursts\n- Rapidly Changeable Mood\n- Poor Social Judgment\nObjective Proof of Brain Injuries With Radiological and Electronic Testing:\nWhen the right tests are performed, doctors can see microstructural brain damage. The American College of Radiology suggests that when attempting to diagnose a brain injury, doctors should be aware of the sensitivity of each type of test and use the most appropriate test based on the circumstances of each person. The following types of radiological testing, in order from least sensitive to most sensitive, can reveal brain injuries:\n1. Not Very Sensitive for Brain Injury Detection: X-Ray\nThis is an easy, fast way to look at our bones. X-Ray is the least effective way to show a closed head brain injury. But, X-Ray is the best test if there is a broken bone, obvious skull fracture, or bullet-type wound.\nX-Ray clearly shows broken bones, which can be a strong indicator of a brain injury. It is excellent at showing the bone structures. However, X-Ray is terrible at showing the soft tissues in our bodies, especially the soft tissue in our brains.\n2. A Little Sensitive for Brain Injury Detection: CT or CAT Scans\nThe next, more sensitive test is a CT, or CAT, Scan. Which stands for Computed Tomography. A CT scan is done using a rotating X-Ray machine that combines X-Ray images with a computer to create three-dimensional representations of structures in our head.\nCT scans are typically used to detect infarction, tumors calcifications, hemorrhages, and bone trauma in the head. CT scans show bones very well and show some soft tissue. But it is not a very sensitive test that reveals brain damage. If the CT scan shows signs of a brain injury, then other, more sensitive tests will show the brain injury more clearly.\n3. Moderately Sensitive for Brain Injury Detection: MRI Testing\nThe next, more sensitive radiological test is the MRI. Which stands for Magnetic Resonance Imaging. This is a more sophisticated test to show brain damage. Unfortunately, MRI cannot pick up mild brain injuries very well. But, it’s excellent at showing moderate damage.\nWe can see the brain’s anatomy in very good detail. But, in many brain injury cases, the damage is so small that it won’t be seen on an MRI. One great advantage to MRI is there is no radiation. Which means there are no harmful effects to the human body. MRI is an excellent way to see our anatomy, but it isn’t sensitive enough to show mild brain injuries.\n4. Very Sensitive for Brain Injury Detection: DTI or Diffusion Tensor Imaging\nThis test is done with the MRI machine. It shows the consistency or disruption of the flow of the brain’s white matter tracts. DTI’s measure the restrictions or disruptions of water diffusion in our brains.\nBrain axons are situated in parallel bundles and their myelin covering (sheath) causes water to flow next to the axons in uninterrupted, relatively straight, lines. So in a healthy brain, the water patterns are long and curved like spaghetti strands.\nBut if a person has a brain injury, like a coup contra coup from a whiplash type injury, then the myelin coverings, or axon sheaths, will be broken, torn or disrupted. DTI’s can reveal this because the water tracks will be interrupted by the shearing injury. Instead of long spaghetti-like strands, it will appear like broken, small pieces of spaghetti.\nImaging and interpretation of water diffusion have improved with the development of diffusion tensor imaging. Diffusion tensor imaging allows direct examination of the axon fibers through the flow of water molecules.\nTherefore, if there is microstructure tissue damage in the brain, we can see it. Diffusion tensor imaging provides excellent details of the white brain matter tracks and we can tell by any disruption if there is damage or injury to the brain.\n5. Extremely Sensitive for Brain injury Detection: Susceptibility Weighted Imaging (SWI)\nSusceptibility Weighted Imaging uses the MRI to show differences in brain matter from one small area to the next. By making tissue comparisons in very small areas, slight differences can be easily seen with SWI.\nSignals from substances with different susceptibilities than their neighboring tissues (such as venous blood or hemorrhage) will look different than the brain cells next to it. The computer can detect these differences and reveal them to us quite easily.\nSWI shows small areas of the brain that have signs of trauma because residue from iron deposits and calcium will be left where the brain injury is."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"with premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"concise_direct"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:40f408de-bc59-44cc-b47e-337d44b5a599>","<urn:uuid:92bddb09-32e5-4a65-8f6a-7221b07ec606>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What's the key difference between harvesting cucumbers and tomatoes for best flavor?","answer":"Cucumbers should be harvested when the tip begins to slightly lighten its green color to a yellow tone, while tomatoes should be left on the plant until fully reddened. For cucumbers, it's recommended to harvest them every other day to avoid overripe fruit, whereas with tomatoes, waiting until they are completely red guarantees the most tasty and juicy result.","context":["Tips for Harvesting Common Allotment Vegetables\nOn Thursday, I posted 6 General Tips for Harvesting. For me, harvesting can be a neglected allotment skill, and the tips were designed to help make sure I reminded myself to take care when picking crops.\nHarvesting produce when at its peak is also dependent on the type of veg. French beans need picking young and tender, for example, whilst tomatoes are best left to ripen on the plant as long as possible.\nHere are some tips I’ve picked up for harvesting individual crops. I’ve followed these tips on the allotment to make sure I eat as much of my veg when flavour is at the very finest.\nFor me, the perfect beetroot is the size of a tennis ball. Beets will sit in the ground and wait patiently to be picked, but don’t let them get too big or they will become woody.\nAlthough sprouts remain perfectly palatable when full size, it’s the little ones that are the real treats. Start harvesting from the bottom, and pull off the dead, yellowy leaves as you go.\nWatch out for the very top of the carrot poking through the soil. I harvest when they’re 3-4mm above the surface. Don’t leave them too late as they’ll split.\nCavolo Nero and Kale\nPick the leaves just above where the stem meets the plant when they are a deep green colour. About 10cm – 13cm is perfect for a kale leaf, whilst cavolo nero can be a bit longer.\nHarvest regularly to allow for new shoots to come through, but try to vary the plants you pick from so they all get ample time to recover.\nChard and Perpetual Spinach\nChard is a very robust plant and responds well to regular harvesting. Again, cut the leaves off where the stem meets the main plant. 15cm is a nice size for a chard leaf.\nCheck courgette plants every day – turn your back for a minute and you’ll end up with marrows! Courgettes are ready when about 15cm long, although the cigar sized ones are very tasty indeed…\nI like to pick cucumbers when they are about half the length of the ones you find in the shops. These will be delicious, but also allow other cues on the plant to grow on.\nIt is a fine line between a tender and a tough French bean. Try to harvest before the seeds in the pods become distinct, as this is when the bean will be at its sweetest.

Looks like fun right?\nA desirable looking cucumber seed can be planted underground, in raised beds or flower pots.\nTo make your harvest worthwhile, it is important to read the seed packaging label carefully to choose the right cucumber type according to your space and cooking needs.\nBefore we talk about the harvesting of cucumbers, let’s share some tips on the planting and caring of the cucumber plant.\nRelated: How To Harvest Onions And Garlic\nTIPS FOR PLANTING THE CUCUMBER\nOnce you find the perfect cucumber variety that suits you, you can plant it. No matter what kind of cucumber you want to grow, the planting process is the same:\n1. Prepare your garden space by removing all weeds, loosening the soil with a tiller or shovel, and adding a fertiliser (if you desire).\n2. Check the soil temperature using a soil thermometer. This is because if the temperature is too high, the seed will not germinate. A temperature of about 60 to 70 degrees is good for planting the cucumber.\n3. Plant the seeds 6 inches apart and 1 inch deep. Cover them with soil.\n4. Use soil that is rich in organic matter, fertile and well-drained. The plant does not require nitrogen-rich soil.\n5. Much water is required in abundance to keep the soil moist.This plant must be watered frequently. The goal is that its roots will not dry out, but should not be soaked in water. Cucumbers do not strive well in soils like this.\nCucumbers are susceptible to fungal and pest problems. Some fungal problems can be avoided by using grids; but others, such as powdery mildew, powdery mildew, and fruit rot, may require some type of intervention. When the first symptoms of the fungus are detected, you can use a ready-to-use fungicide to prevent the fungus from causing further damage to the plant.\nFor common pests like cucumber beetles, aphids, and powerful insecticide powder that can be applied up to three days before harvesting cucumbers.\nHARVESTING THE CUCUMBER\nHarvesting the cucumber is the fun part of growing cucumbers. After finishing the hard work, it is time to sit back and enjoy your harvest.\nThe cucumber can be harvested 60-70 days after planting. Although, this time depends largely on the type of cucumber planted, the purpose and growing conditions.\nTo harvest the cucumber, use sharp pruning shears to cut the cucumber stems open. Since the vines and cucumber stems are very fragile, do not pull the fruit as this may damage the plant. Cucumbers ripen quickly, which is why you should pick them every other day to avoid overripe.\nIf you plant your cucumber properly, your cucumber will occupy as many areas as there is space for it.\nWhether you grow a small number of cucumber plants for pickling or a large number of varieties for slicing, this fruitful crop will produce fresh fruit to satisfy your hunger throughout the season.\nYou should know that it is harvest time when the tip of the cucumber fruit begins to slightly lighten its green color to a yellow tone.\nRelated: How To Harvest Tomatoes At Home\nIn this article, I discussed how to harvest cucumber seeds.

{"question":"How do the traditional dyeing methods compare between felt-making in Kyrgyzstan and batik-making in Java?","answer":"In Kyrgyzstan, felt artisans traditionally used natural dyeing and natural-colored wool of various tones. In contrast, traditional Javanese batik used specific natural ingredients for colors: blue from Indigo plant leaves mixed with molasses sugar and lime, brown (soga) from Soga tree bark, and dark red (mengkuda) from Morinda Citrifolia leaves. The Javanese process was more complex, with multiple dye baths required - for darker colors, cloth would be submerged up to 8-10 times a day.","context":["What is Felt ?\nFelt has been defined as \" a textile structure composed entirely of fibres physically interlocked and consolidated by the use of mechanical work, chemical action and moisture without the use of weaving, knitting, stitching, thermal bonding or adesives. Wool fibers are feltd by the application of heat, moisture and friction. Felt is formed from a web of animal hair or wool which is consoldiated by moisture, heat and mechanical action.\nAlmost all Kyrgyz crafts have their roots in the nomadic lifestyle. Nomadic life left its imprint on Kyrgyz dwellings, clothes, and household utensils. Even with the eventual end to the nomadic healthy lifestyle, Kyrgyz applied arts still have not lost their significance and have been cherished and passed down from one generation to the next.\nFelt articles are the most popular and widespread in Kyrgyzstan. Felt serves as the main material in constructing yurts (Kyrgyz portable tent). The yurt cover and many interior items are made of felt, such as carpets, bags, and slippers.\"\nFrequently, artisans used natural dyeing and natural-colored wool of various tones to make their goods. These color combinations look very organic in modern dwelling and public interiors.\nThe felt-making for yurts is traditionally done within each family, using wool from their own sheep. Felts for the walls and roof of the yurt is plain, without decoration, but felts for the floor of the yurt are often decorated. The finished felts are effective and good-looking, but making them is hard work. The raw wool is taken from the sheep, is then cleaned and thoroughly picked over to remove any impurities or unevenness. The unspun wool is then arranged thickly on top of a straw mat, known as a «chiy mat» (a mat which also has practical use as a divider and for storage in the yurt).\nAt this point, the thickness of the wool is about 20cm or so. Now the process of felt-making begins in earnest with the beating and hammering of the wool, pressing and compacting the raw wool into the resulting felt. This beating is done utilizing all available means - sticks, the forearms of the makers, rolling, tightening with ropes, kicking. Small amounts of very hot water are added to help with the adhesion, and the whole process has to be carried out in hot conditions - outside in the summer months.\nCentral Asian silks\nFrom ancient times, silk has been a highly treasured material. In ancient China and Japan, silk clothes were the privilege for the aristocracy. Traditional silk fabrics were produced in Bukhara, Samarkand, Kokand, Margilan, Namangan, and other cities of Uzbekistan. Only the rich could afford clothes made of silk fabrics such as \"kanoviz,\" \"shoi,\" \"khan atlas\" and silk blends like \"bekasab,\" \"banoras,\" \"adras.\"\nVisit sewingmachinesguide.com for information on Sewing, Sewing Machines, Accessories for sewing, Reviews and more.\nAs the legend goes, long ago the Governor of Margilan (a famous silk producing center today) ordered his people to create an unique product, which could not be found anywhere else. Many masters fled for fear of falling into disgrace with the Governor. One master, while sitting on the lake shore thinking about his family's future and the fate of his colleagues, suddenly noticed upon the water's surface the reflection of a cloud in the sky in which the different colors of a rainbow were poured into the sunset. The image inspired him to create the same effect with silk threads.Later he presented to the Governor a wonderful fabric with an iridescent pattern. The Governor and his family, especially his whimsical daughter, were delighted by the beauty of the silk. When he learned of the master's inspiration, the Governor named the mater \"Abrband.\" \"Abr\" in Persian means cloud and \"band\" means wicker-work. Even today, all masters working in this style are called \"abrbands,\" and this type of silk production is called \"abrbandi.\"\n\"Shyrdaks\" are traditional felt rugs made by sewing patterns of contrasting felt together using patterns often inspired from nature such as mountains, animal horns and birds. They are used by the Nomadic tribes and shepherds in Tien Shan (heavenly) Mountains in Kyrgyzstan to decorate their yurtas (round tents made of white felt) and houses. Shyrdaks are sold to be given as presents to brides or their wedding. Now it has become valuable income earning source for the artisan since the export bagan. The felt can be natural colours or dyed in contrasting colours using local plants.","Although the art form of batik is very intricate, the tools that are used are still very simple. The canting, believed to be a purely Javanese invention, is a small thin wall spouted copper container (sometimes called a wax pen) that is connected to a short bamboo handle. Normally it is approximately 11 cm. in length. The copper container is filled with melted wax and the artisan then uses the canting to draw the design on the cloth.\nCanting have different sizes of spouts (numbered to correspond to the size) to achieve varied design effects. The spout can vary from 1 mm in diameter for very fine detailed work to wider spouts used to fill in large design areas. Dots and parallel lines may be drawn with canting that have up to 9 spouts. Sometimes a wad of cotton is fastened over the mouth of the canting or attached to a stick that acts as a brush to fill in very large areas.\nWajan and Stove\nThe wajan is the container that holds the melted wax. It’s hot wax pot. Normally it is made of iron or earthenware. The wajan is placed on a small brick charcoal stove or a spirit burner called an ‘anglo’. The wax is kept in a melted state while the artisan is applying the wax to batik fabric.\nDifferent kinds and qualities of wax are used in batik. Common waxes used for batik consist of a mixture of beeswax, used for its malleability, and paraffin, used for its friability. Resins can be added to increase adhesiveness and animal fats create greater liquidity.\nThe best waxes are from the Indonesian islands of Timor, Sumbawa and Sumatra; three types of petroleum-based paraffin (white, yellow and black) are used. The amounts mixed are measured in grams and vary according to the design. Wax recipes can be very closely guarded secrets. Varying colors of wax make it possible to disguise different parts of the pattern through the various dying stages. Larger areas of the pattern are filled in with wax that is cheaper quality and the higher quality wax is used on the more intricately detailed sections of the design.\nThe wax must be kept at the proper temperature. A wax that is too cool will clog the spout of the canting. A wax that is too hot will flow too quickly and be uncontrollable. The artisan will often blow into the spout of the canting before applying wax to the cloth in order to clear the canting of any obstructions.\nCreating batik is a very time consuming craft. To meet growing demands and make the fabric more affordable to the masses, in the mid-19th century the . cap. (copper stamp – pronounced chop) was developed. This invention enabled a higher volume of batik production compared to the traditional method which entailed the tedious application of wax by hand with a canting.\nEach tjap is a copper block that makes up a design unit. tjap are made of 1.5 cm wide copper stripes that are bent into the shape of the design. Smaller pieces of wire are used for the dots. When complete, the pattern of copper strips is attached to the handle.\nThe tjap must be precisely made. This is especially true if the pattern is to be stamped on both sides of the fabric. It is imperative that both sides of the cap are identical so that pattern will be consistent.\nSometimes tjap are welded between two grids like pieces of copper that will make a base for the top and theApplying wax with cap bottom. The block is cut in half at the center so the pattern on each half is identical. tjap vary in size and shape depending on the pattern they are needed for. It is seldom that a cap will exceed 24 cm in diameter, as this would make the handling too difficult.\nMen usually handle the application of wax using cap. A piece of batik fabric that involves a complicated design could require as many as ten sets of cap. The usage of cap, as opposed to canting, to apply the wax has reduced the amount of time to make a cloth.\nToday, batik quality is defined by tjap and tulis, the second meaning hand-drawn designs which use a canting and stamp, or kombinasi, a combination of the two techniques.\nTraditional colors for Central Javanese batik were made from natural ingredients and consisted primarily of beige, blue, brown and black.\nThe oldest color that was used in traditional batik making was blue. The color was made from the leaves of the Indigo plant. The leaves were mixed with molasses sugar and lime and left to stand overnight. Sometimes sap from the Tinggi tree was added to act as a fixing agent. Lighter blue was achieved by leaving the cloth in the dye bath for short periods of time. For darker colors, the cloth would be left in the dye bath for days and may have been submerged up to 8 – 10 times a day.\nIn traditional batik, the second color applied was a brown color called soga. The color could range from light yellow to a dark brown. The dye came from the bark of the Soga tree. Another color that was traditionally used was a dark red color called mengkuda. This dye was created from the leaves of the Morinda Citrifolia.\nThe final hue depended on how long the cloth was soaked in the dye bath and how often it was dipped. Skilled artisans can create many variations of these traditional colors. Aside from blue, green would be achieved by mixing blue with yellow; purple was obtained by mixing blue and red. The soga brown color mixed with indigo would produce a dark blue-black color.\nBatik -which has been a culture in Majapahit- could be found at Mojokerto and Tulungagung. Mojokerto was a region related to Majapahit. At Tulungagung, we could find many heritages and stories. Once upon a time, it happen the fight between Majapahit and the ruler of Tulungagung, Adipati Karanglewas. He was murdered at that fight. As a result, the region was occupied by Majapahit and it brought batik culture in this region. Nowadays, batik regions in Mojokaerto are Kwali, Mojosari, Betero, Sidomulyo and Jombang. In the end of 19th centuries, there were some batik makers using the material weaved white clothe and for the batik drugs, it made of soga jambal, bengkudu, nila tom, tinggi, etc. Foreign drug had just been known after the World War I. It was sold by China trader at Mojokerto. Stamp batik and foreign drug were known at the same time. Stamp was produced in Bangil and Mojokerto. Batik entrepreneur could buy it in Porong Sidoarjo market. It was known as a crowded market –before world economy crises- whose many batik productions came from Keducangkring and Jetis Sidoarjo. When the economy crises had occurred, Mojokerto batik entrepreneur couldn’t run their business. It took place until the occupation of Japan in Indonesia. The batik trade recovered after the revolution. At that time, Mojokerto had become a colony region. The specific feature of Mojokerto batik (kalangbret) is almost similar to Yogyakarta batik – white background, light brown, and dark blue design- Although batik has been known since Majapahit, its development has just begun spreading quickly at Yogyakarta and Surakarta. It could be found by considering its design.\nWhen bitter fight occurred between Dutch and Diponegoro troops, Kyai Mojo withdrew most of his troops. They ran a way to the East, Majan -It has been a status as Merdikan village, special district and its village headman is a kyai (Islamic teacher or Islamic leader) whose title is given hereditary. This kind of Majan batik production is a heritage of Diponegoro period.\nBabaran color of Majan and Simo batik are unique. Its light red comes from bengkudu and the other ones come from tom. Many of batik entrepreneurs came from Solo. They arrived in Tulungagung in the end of 19th centuries. While the batik center, it was in Sembung. Now, some of them lived there.\nIn addition, there were also many batik regions called Trenggalek and other regions in Kediri – in which batik nature is household craft and its babaran is handwritten batik- Ponorogo, whose batik art has a close relation with Islamic spreading and the last kingdoms. It has been said there was Majapahit descendent in Batorokatong region, called Raden Katong (Raden Patah’s young brother) who spread Islam in Ponorogo. His current heritage is a mosque, located in East Patihan area.\nThe next development, there was an Islamic Boarding in Ponorogo, Tegal sari, which has been managed by Kyai Hasan Basri. Many people had known him as Kyai Agung Tegal Sari. He had become a son in law of Solo king. In this place, people learned not only Islamic religion but also constitution, war science and literature. One of the most outstanding pupils from Tegal Sari, Raden Ronggowarsito, had a great concern in literature. Batik art had just known in palace area in that time. However, not long afterward, it became down to earth in Tegalsari because Kyai Hasan Basri and his wife (the princess of Solo) followed by her companions, had moved on and lived there. They taught it to the youth. The educated youth would devote themselves in society, especially in the field of administration and religion.\nThe old batik area that we can find until today are in Kauman region such as East Kepatihan, Ronowijoyo, Mangunkusuman, Kertosari Setono, Cokromenggolo, Kadipaten, Nologaten, Bangunsari, Cekok, Banyudono dan Ngunut. Many years ago, drugs used in batik process were self domestic product made of various trees: Tom tree, Bengkudu tree, and Tinggi Wooden. For white material, it was also self domestic product made of Gendong weaving. Bam import white material had just been known in Indonesia approximately in the end of 19th centuries.\nStamp batik production has just been known after Word War I presented by Chinese, kwee seng in Banyumas. In the beginning of 20th centuries, batik was a leading product in Ponorogo especially on its nila color that was difficult to become discolored. This was the reason why many entrepreneurs from Banyumas and Solo provided a lot of jobs to batik entrepreneur in Ponorogo. The popularity of stamp batik had led to the present of rough batik called blue unbleached plain cloth. Then, stamp batik had become a leading product in Indonesia.\nIt has a close relation with Majapahit Kingdom development and Islamic spreading in java. In many cases, most of batik development occurred in Mataram period, Solo and Yogyakarta Kingdom. Therefore, it has been known since the period of Majapahit Kingdom and it keep on improving for the next kings.\nMeanwhile, in the end of 18th centuries or in the beginning of 19th centuries, batik has been dominated by Indonesian people, especially by Javanese. In the beginning of 20th centuries, they produced handwritten batik while stamp batik had just been known in 1920. Related to Islamic spreading, most of the batik shopping center was located in Islamic regions and it was used to struggle against the Dutch economy.\nBatik art is a painting art on the material. It had a function to be a costume worn by the princes in the past. For the first time, it has just been produced in the palace area and it was worn by the prince, his family and his companions. Then, it was brought and processed outside because many of the companions lived out of the palace area. Not long afterward, it was imitated by the closest people and then it became a livelihood for many housewives to spend their leisure time. Finally, batik was not only worn by prince and his family but also for common people, both man and woman. Furthermore, the batik material is made by weaving. For the dye material, it came from Indonesian natural plants such as: Bengkudu tree, tinggi, soga and nila. The soda material made of ash soda while its salt made of mud."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:f12d4372-0cc8-4d3b-b7ea-f77ee8e28128>","<urn:uuid:c9a56181-2ed7-4ccd-9c4e-24237806a135>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How do traditional classroom behavioral issues compare to online classroom incivility, and what are the recommended solutions for each?","answer":"Traditional classroom behavioral issues often involve direct disruptions like inappropriate dress, time management problems, and visible confrontations. Solutions include using timeouts effectively, managing teacher anger appropriately, and implementing clear classroom management plans. In the online environment, incivility manifests differently, including flaming messages, hostile communications, demanding special treatment, making offensive remarks, and sending inappropriate emails. Common causes include students feeling anonymous behind computers and viewing education as service-based.

Just because the form of classroom interactions has changed doesn’t mean that the potential for acts of incivility has lessened. In some ways, it can become more difficult to remain civil and develop effective working relationships online due to the lack of face-to-face exchanges, which allow students to clarify their communication. Students and instructors have a responsibility to recognize what constitutes incivility and take proactive steps to prevent it, and one of the most effective methods students can use is to develop their virtual emotional intelligence.\nIncivility in the Online Class\nDr. P.M. Forni, author of Choosing Civility: The Twenty-five Rules of Considerate Conduct and professor at Johns Hopkins University, shared a definition of civility in Ethical Action and Relational Competence – Why Manners and Civility are Good: “civility is linked to the Latin word civitas, which means city and community. Thus, civility implies a larger social concern. When we are civil we are members in good standing of a community, we are good neighbors and good citizens.” The online classroom is a community of students who are working towards common academic goals – collaborative participation in discussions and completion of their classwork. To be civil in class is to maintain respect for other students with all exchanges, along with appropriate behavior, so that meaningful collaboration can occur. The converse then becomes true – any form of inappropriate behavior constitutes incivility.\nWithin the Journal of Adult Education (2010, p.4), the article Understanding Incivility in Online Teaching provides a specific list of behaviors and acts that represent the most common forms of incivility within online classes:\n• Challenging authority\n• Demanding special treatment\n• An “I paid for this mentality”\n• Making offensive remarks\n• Missing deadlines\n• Reluctance in answering questions or participating in online discussion\n• Challenging the instructor’s credibility\n• Taunting or belittling others\n• Challenging the instructor’s knowledge\n• Making physical threats to the instructor\n• Engaging in academic dishonesty (cheating and/or plagiarism)\n• Making harassing, hostile, or vulgar comments\n• Sending the instructor inappropriate emails\nFrom my teaching perspective, I do not consider all of these items to be a form of inappropriate or uncivil behavior. For example, missing a deadline or failing to participate in the class discussion may indicate a lack of proper time management or self-motivation. Behaviors that are unacceptable are those that interrupt the class and are clearly addressed by the Student Code of Conduct. Some of these inappropriate behaviors could be classified within one main category, called flaming messages or “hostile and aggressive communicative behaviors.” This can occur in class through discussion board posts and email, when students are overly aggressive in their response to others. It is up to the instructors to assess the situation and develop a plan of action.\nHow Instructors View Incivility\nInstructors often consider incivility as disruptive behavior when those actions interfere with the learning process or become a threat to another student. Offensive posts are those that include “hate speech; racially, sexually, or gender-biased offensive language; or offensive speech regarding religious views” (Mechenbier & Prescott, 2009). The most common reasons why incivility occurs in the online classroom includes the following:\n• Students are not “visible” in online courses as they are in the classroom and are therefore emboldened, believing they can be anonymous behind the computer.\n• Students may have had little experience with civil behavior online.\n• Students view education as service-based, and as “consumers” they expect entitlement.\n• Students fear being powerless, challenged, or feel threatened by new ideas, causing them to act defensively through incivility (Mechenbier & Prescott, 2009).\nThe primary proactive approach that instructors often take is to provide guidelines and expectations of appropriate classroom behavior within the course syllabus, which is considered to be a contract between the instructor and students. For example, I include Rules of Netiquette or appropriate online behavior within the syllabus to establish parameters for posting and sending messages. I also include information about the Student Code of Conduct at my institution, which further outlines acceptable behaviors and establishes the school’s policy for handling misconduct or inappropriate behavior. Just as important as stating the policies, is enforcement of the rules, which means I am actively monitoring discussions and responding quickly to any inappropriate behaviors. In addition to providing guidelines, I also emphasize the need for managing emotions as a means of dealing with and preventing disruptive behaviors.\nA Need for Virtual Emotional Intelligence\nIn my post, Why Emotional Intelligence is Needed More Than Ever, I addressed college students in general. However, online students are also in need of emotional intelligence. At the beginning of that post I talked about digital communication. From my experience, online students learn that communication in an academic setting is different than using the abbreviated forms of communication that are present in text messaging because they need to clearly communicate their thoughts in a way that can be easily read and interpreted. Class posts also determine how relationships are developed because they carry a tone that students recognize perceptually as they read them. Students read and interpret messages, filtering the intent and tone through electronic means. This requires what I refer to as a need for virtual emotional intelligence.\nIn his article, The Other Side of Civility, Dr. P.M. Forni talks about emotions from the perspective of being kind to others and demonstrating empathy, as a means of strengthening our relationship skills. Forni believes that “good manners prove crucial when it comes to establishing and maintaining connection and rapport.” During class discussions I’ve observed the lasting effects that incivility can have and more importantly, the relationship between students. After students have engaged in flaming posts between each other their relationship becomes damaged, often irreparably.\nAuthor Edward Hallowell talks about positive emotions being good for our health and our thinking skills. Hallowell states that a person who manages their emotions can “think flexibly; perceive shades of gray, subtlety, complexity; bear with the frustration of not knowing the answer, and allowing conflicting points of view simultaneously to balance in his mind without either overpowering the other; wait, before bringing premature closure; ask for help; empathize with others; give to others; put the needs of others before his own; give help; inspire others.” Most of these qualities are transferrable to communication within the online class. For example, the perceptual tone of students’ posts is evident through their word choices. Students who have strong emotional intelligence are supportive of others; ask follow up questions without being threatening, and when they disagree, they do so in a respectful manner.\nMindTools provides tips on Improving Your Emotional Intelligence, and the list includes observing your reactions to others and stressful situation, taking responsibility for your actions, and considering how your actions affect others. When I talk to students about managing their emotions they agree that it is the key to being civil in class because most inappropriate behavior occurs after they have read something posted by another student. I also suggest that students create their responses first offline, read it aloud to determine how it may be interpreted, and if necessary – due to an emotional reaction – put it aside and return to it again later.\nOnline and Civil\nAs an online student you are going to interact with students who have diverse opinions, beliefs, and backgrounds. If you want to work effectively with your classmates you need to be civil and avoid inappropriate behavior. Incivility not only violates school conduct policies, but can permanently damage your future interactions with students and your instructor. Work to develop your virtual emotional intelligence and you’ll discover that you become less reactive to class conditions and discussions, and more proactively involved in the learning process because you are successfully collaborating with others.\nYou can follow Dr. Bruce A.

{"question":"As a naval history researcher, I'm curious how the Battle of Midway impacted both individual sailors and the broader course of World War II - could you explain the personal sacrifices and strategic significance of this battle?","answer":"The Battle of Midway had profound impacts both personally and strategically. At the individual level, many sailors made the ultimate sacrifice - including aviators like Ensign Frederick Weber, who died while attacking the carrier Hiryu, and overall 307 Americans lost their lives in the battle. The U.S. also lost the carrier Yorktown and 145 aircraft. At the strategic level, the battle proved to be a turning point of World War II. The Japanese lost four fleet carriers along with their crews, which cost them vital air superiority and forced their retreat. The victory not only halted Japan's advance but also significantly lifted American morale at a time when things looked bleak. The battle's outcome was achieved through the determination of sailors and pilots who, despite fuel concerns and lack of fighter cover, persevered to find and strike the Japanese carriers.","context":["Frederick Thomas Weber-born on 4 February 1916 at Des Moines, Iowa-attended college at Knox College in Galesburg, Ill., in 1933 and 1934 before transferring to Drake University in Des Moines in 1935. He graduated from the latter school during the summer of 1938 and enlisted in the United States Naval Reserve on 30 August of that year. During the ensuing winter, Seaman 2d Class Weber successfully completed elimination flight training at the Naval Reserve Aviation Base, Kansas City, Kansas; and, on 27 July 1939, he was appointed an aviation cadet in the Naval Reserve. After 10 months of training at the Naval Air Station, Pensacola, Fla., Weber was appointed a naval aviator on 10 May 1940. A little over a month later, he concluded his training and, on 12 June 1940, received his commission as an ensign in the Naval Reserve. That same day, he received orders to report for duty with Bombing Squadron (VB) 6 attached to the carrier Enterprise (CV-6).\nEnterprise and VB-6 proved to be Ens. Weber's only assignment during his brief naval career. During the remainder of 1940 and for 11 of the 12 months of 1941, he served with his ship and squadron operating out of San Diego, and later out of Pearl Harbor. His duties consisted entirely of training in aerial warfare in preparation for the conflict with Japan expected to erupt at any time.\nAt the end of the first week in December 1941, he was at sea with Enterprise which was returning from Wake Island where she had just delivered Marine Fighting Squadron (VMF) 211. Foiled in their attempt to locate the Japanese striking force on 7 December, Weber and his colleagues rode their carrier into devastated Pearl Harbor on the 8th. The following morning, they put to sea in Enterprise and began defensive patrols of the area to assure that no enemy invasion force was on its way to Hawaii.\nIn January 1942, Weber's ship guarded reinforcement convoys on their way to the southern Pacific. In February he participated in the carrier raids on Japanese-held islands in the Central Pacific. In April, his ship served as an escort for Hornet (CV-8) during the Halsey-Doolittle bomber raid on Tokyo and returned to Oahu on 25 April. Dispatched too late to join in the Battle of the Coral Sea, his ship returned to Pearl Harbor on 26 May to prepare for what would be an even more important strategic battle-the first real defeat of Japanese naval airpower during the struggle over Midway Island.\nOn 28 May, Weber's ship steamed out of Pearl Harbor, accompanied by Hornet and the cruisers and destroyers of Task Force 16, to lie in ambush north of Midway. Swiftly repaired Yorktown (CV-5) followed two days later. On the morning of 4 June, land-based patrol planes from Midway made contact with the advancing Japanese force spearheaded by four of the six carriers that had attacked Pearl Harbor. While Midway defended itself against enemy air attacks and landbased air unsuccessfully tried to pierce the Japanese defenses, Weber and his comrades in VB-6 took to the air to begin a long gruelling search. By 0730, the entire attack group was aloft and streaking off toward the enemy's reported position. Lt. Comdr. Clarence \"Wade\" McClusky, the Enterprise air group commander, led the squadron himself as the formation winged on toward Vice Admiral Chuichi Nagumo's Carrier Striking Force.\nAt 0920, the squadron arrived at the supposed location of the enemy. Gazing down, the aircrewman strained for a glimpse of the threatening carriers but saw only empty seas. At that juncture, the air group commander made a hard decision. His planes had already consumed a great deal of fuel, and, were they to initiate a search, some would surely fail to return as a result. On the other hand, if they returned for fuel, Midway might fall or, even worse, the enemy might find and sink or severely damage one or more of the Pacific Fleet's three remaining carriers. Therefore, the importance of stopping Nagumo's carriers at almost any cost dictated the course of action. The American pilots ignored their fuel gauges and started hunting for the Japanese.\nAt 1005, Weber and his colleagues were rewarded for their perseverance and determination. On the horizon to the northwest loomed a task force composed of three large carriers and numerous escorts. Initially, some Americans believed that they had inadvertently circled back to their ships, but pagoda masts and yellow flight decks of the carriers below quickly dispelled that fear.\nThough originally intending to attack Akagi, the squadron leader noticed that Scouting 6 had only near-missed Kaga, so he switched targets at the last minute and headed for the latter. Ens. Weber followed his squadron leader in on carrier Kaga as the third plane in the first section. The Bombing 6 Action Report states that \". . . at least three 1,000-pound bomb hits were observed on that target and it became a mass of flame and smoke.\" Since only the three Bombing 6 planes which participated in the attack on that carrier carried that size bomb, Weber and his two squadron mates all apparently scored direct hits on the target. Hence Weber contributed as much as anyone to the sinking of Kaga.\nPulling out of his dive, Weber formed on his leader, and the squadron headed home to refuel and rearm. At least one Japanese carrier remained intact, Hiryu, whose position far ahead of the other three saved her momentarily.\nThat afternoon, Weber took off from Enterprise with a composite attack group made up of the remnants of the several groups decimated earlier. At about 1545, planes from Scouting 6 and 14 of Yorktown's Bombing 3 joined with the four operational aircraft remaining to Bombing 6 and sped off in chase of the remaining carrier. Unfortunately, the American fighters still extant had to remain with the carriers as combat air patrol so the attack group was denuded of fighter cover.\nAbout an hour later, the American hunters found their quarry. The American planes climbed to 19,000 feet and maneuvered their way up sun of Hiryu and her escorts. During the jockeying for position, Japanese fighters jumped the unprotected dive bombers. Before reaching the \"push over\" point, Ens. Weber's plane fell victim to the enemy fighters. He and his aircrewman Aviation Ordnanceman 3d Class E. L. Hilbert, spiraled into the sea and to their deaths. For his part in sinking Kaga and for his supreme sacrifice in assisting his colleagues to sink the remaining enemy carrier, Ens. Weber was promoted retroactively to lieutenant (junior grade) and was awarded the Navy Cross posthumously.\n(DE-675: dp. 1,400; 1. 306'0\"; b. 36'10\"; dr. 9' 5\" (mean); s. 24 k. ; cpl. 186; a. 3 3\", 4 1.1\", 8 20mm., 8 dcp., 1 dcp. (hh.), 2 dct.; cl. Buckley)\nWeber (DE-675) was laid down on 22 February at Quincy, Mass., by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Co.; launched on 1 May 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Matt A. Walsh, and commissioned on 30 June 1943, Comdr. Rollo N. Norgaard in command.\nThe destroyer escort completed fitting out and then departed Provincetown, Mass., on 23 July for Bermuda. At the conclusion of shakedown training in waters surrounding those islands, she returned north and arrived in Boston, Mass., on 21 August. Following post-shakedown availability, the new warship left Boston for several days of additional training-in antisubmarine warfare tactics-out of New London, Conn. Upon completing that assignment, Weber entered New York harbor to prepare for her first combat duty.\nOn 5 September, the warship stood out of New York in the screen of a transatlantic convoy. Following a relatively uneventful voyage, she and her charges entered port at Londonderry, Northern Ireland, on the 16th. There, she remained until the 21st, when she headed back across the Atlantic with a return convoy. She ended that voyage at St. John's, Newfoundland, on 1 October but soon thereafter, moved to New York for a 10-day availability at the navy yard at Brooklyn.\nIn mid-October, Weber escorted a convoy from New York to the Dutch island of Curacao, off the coast of Venezuela. She arrived in Willemstad on 24 October and remained there five days awaiting the formation of a transatlantic convoy. This group of Allied ships departed Curacao on 29 October and set a course for the British Isles and arrived in Londonderry on Armistice Day 1943.\nAt that point, Weber settled into a routine of escorting convoys between Londonderry and New York which lasted until August of 1944. By that time, she had made six more round-trip voyages between those ports. On many occasions during the period, she and her consorts in the screen made sonar and radar contacts on unidentified ships. While on such occasions they frequently attacked the strangers with depth charges, Weber and her sister escorts directed their greatest efforts to diverting their transports and cargo ships from the paths of U-boats. When doing so, they informed nearby hunter/killer groups of the location of the contacts and delegated to them primary responsibility for offensive antisubmarine warfare. As a result, confirmed U-boat kills eluded Weber, but she and the other escorts in the screens accomplished their primary mission of shepherding the convoys safely across the ocean.\nOn 7 August, she departed Londonderry for the last time. Her convoy arrived safely in New York on the 20th and, after voyage repairs, the warship began preparations to embark upon a new but brief phase in her wartime career. After the Allied forces which invaded Europe in June established control over the coast of France, convoys no longer needed to travel the long northern route around Ireland to avoid enemy aircraft and submarines based on that coast. Instead, they now could use the shorter and more economical route around the southern coast of England directly to the French channel ports primary among which was Cherbourg. In September, Weber made one round-trip voyage to Cherbourg; then returned to the United States via that route and arrived back at New York near the end of the month.\nAfter a 10-day availability and four days of exercises, the ship proceeded to Norfolk to join a convoy bound for North Africa and the Mediterranean Sea. She departed Norfolk with the convoy on 21 October. En route to Gibraltar, she rescued the crew of a Portuguese fishing vessel damaged badly in a collision with Weber during an investigation of the then-unidentified vessel. Soon after the rescue, the Portuguese vessel sank. After landing the fishermen at Gibraltar, Weber continued on to Bizerte, Tunisia where she stopped on 12 November, and thence proceeded to Palermo, Sicily, for repairs to damage sustained in the collision with the Portuguese trawler. She rejoined her escort group at Oran, Algeria, and embarked upon the return voyage on 23 November. Weber escorted one section of the attached convoy into Philadelphia on 10 December.\nFive days after her arrival in Philadelphia, Weber was redesignated a high-speed transport and received a new hull number, APD-75. Conversion work on her began immediately. During the following three months, she exchanged her 3-inch battery for a new 5-inch, dualpurpose gun which had proven highly effective both for antiaircraft defense and for bombardment work. In addition, her relatively weak antiaircraft battery was beefed up substantially. Her spaces were modified to provide a place for underwater demolition teams (UDT) and their equipment. Her conversion indicated an impending reassignment to the Pacific theater where the UDT men played an important role in the initial stages of amphibious operations. She completed her conversion in mid-March 1945.\nDuring the latter part of the month, she moved to Norfolk where she practiced shore bombardments and antiaircraft defense. On 14 April, she departed Norfolk. Arriving at Panama on the 19th, she transited the canal the following day and reported for duty with the Pacific Fleet. Continuing her voyage, the warship stopped briefly at San Diego and then headed for the Hawaiian Islands. She arrived in Pearl Harbor on 8 May and underwent a brief period of voyage repairs. During the middle part of May, she conducted reconnaissance and demolition exercises at Kahoolawe, Maui, with members of UDT 23. After a short series of refresher training and antisubmarine warfare exercises, she departed Oahu on the 24th for the western Pacific. She entered the lagoon at Eniwetok on 1 June, remained for a day due to a fueling delay, and then continued on to Ulithi where she arrived on 6 June.\nOn 13 June, Weber departed Ulithi to escort California (BB-34) to Okinawa where the battleship was needed to render gunfire support to American forces subduing the defenders on the southern portion of the island. The task unit arrived off the island four days later. Following a short time at Hagushi anchorage, Weber put into the roadstead at Kerama Retto for fuel. On 25 June, she was assigned to a surface force built around battleships California and West Virginia (BB-48), and cruisers Wichita (CA-45), Tuscaloosa (CA-37), San Francisco (CA-38), St. Louis (CL-49), and Chester (CA-27). Serving as antisubmarine and mine escort for that unit, she patrolled the waters around Okinawa until 1 July, protecting communications and supply lines. She returned to Hagushi for a week on 1 July and departed the Ryukyus on the 8th in the screen of a convoy bound for the Marianas. Delivering her charges safely at Saipan on July 12th, she continued her voyage the following day and arrived at San Pedro Bay, Leyte, on the 17th. She spent the remaining weeks of World War II at Leyte engaged in training exercises in preparation for the expected invasion of the Japanese home islands. Fortunately, the Japanese agreed to surrender terms on 15 August, making that operation unnecessary.\nSoon after the cessation of hostilities, Weber returned to Okinawa to prepare for the occupation of territory remaining in Japanese hands. She arrived back in the Ryukyus on 21 August and reported for duty with Task Force (TF) 95. She trained briefly with that task organization at Okinawa until 7 September when she reported for duty with TF 55. On 10 September she departed the Ryukyus with Task Unit (TU) 55.7.1 bound for Japan. She and her colleagues arrived at Nagasaki the following day and began two weeks of service evacuating and caring for former Allied prisoners of war held in Japan. She completed that assignment on 23 September and returned to Okinawa on the 25th. On 7 October, the warship put to sea once more, this time bound for Tsingtao and Taku in northern China with a convoy carrying marines for duty ashore there. A severe typhoon, however, scattered the little flotilla and damaged some of the ships, forcing Weber to return to Okinawa as an escort for the more severely damaged ones. She rejoined the remainder of the convoy just before mid-month and escorted a portion of it into Taku on 16 October. The next day, she got underway for the Philippines with two American merchant ships which she saw safely to Okinawa before breaking off and continuing on to Luzon. The ship arrived in Manila on 23 October and, after discharging about 100 passengers, headed back to China. During the month of November, she shuttled Nationalist Chinese troops from Hong Kong to strife-torn northern China.\nShe concluded that duty at Tsingtao on 25 November and sailed for the east coast of the United States that same day. Steaming via Okinawa, Guam, and Eniwetok, she arrived in Pearl Harbor on 13 December. On the 16th, she resumed her voyage home and arrived in San Diego on the 22d. Following a week's layover, she left San Diego and set course for the Panama Canal. The warship transited the canal between 7 and 9 January 1946 and headed for New York on the latter date. She entered the New York Naval Shipyard on 15 January, discharged passengers, and began her preinactivation overhaul. On 18 February, she departed New York and, after a two-day stop at Norfolk, Va., arrived in Green Cove Springs, Fla., on the 23d. There, she reported to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet for layup. Placed out of commission by directive in January 1947, Weber remained inactive for more than 15 years. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 1 June 1960, and, a little over two years later, she was sunk as a target on 15 July 1962 by \"Bullpup\" air-launched missiles.\nWeber earned one battle star during World War II.","USS GEORGE H.W. BUSH (CVN 77) Hosts 68th Anniversary of the Battle of Midway Commemoration\nFrom USS GEORGE H.W. BUSH Public Affairs\nNORFOLK, Va. (NNS) -- USS GEORGE H.W. BUSH (CVN 77) hosted two World War II veterans and hundreds of Sailors from across the Hampton Roads area, as they observed the 68th anniversary of the historic Battle of Midway on the flight deck of the aircraft carrier June 4.\nThe commemoration, hosted by Commander, United States Fleet Forces, Adm. J.C. Harvey Jr., was attended by Battle of Midway veterans William Eckel and Howard Snell. Both men served aboard ships during the battle, and traveled to Norfolk to attend the ceremony.\nThe Battle of Midway, which is often referred to as the turning point of World War II, took place June 4-7, 1942, when the Japanese sent the majority of their naval force to capture Midway Island, which was being used by U.S. forces as an airfield. The battle was primarily fought by aircraft launched from aircraft carriers. By the battle's end, the Japanese had to retreat after losing vital air superiority. The U.S. lost the carrier Yorktown while four Japanese fleet carriers were lost along with their crew.\nThe commemoration featured musical selections played by Fleet Forces Band, a moment of silence, remarks from Harvey and Kilcline, and an invocation and benediction led by Cmdr. Cameron Fish, command chaplain. A vintage TBM-1 Avenger conducted a fly over during the ceremony. The Avenger got its combat debut during the decisive battle and is also the same model of aircraft flown by the aircraft carrier's namesake George H.W. Bush.\nThe ceremony also featured a wreath-laying presentation, as Harvey was joined by Eckel and Snell to pay homage to the brave men who lost their lives during the battle.\n\"It was important to me that this event be by Sailors, about Sailors,\" Harvey said. The event that took place 68 years ago today was done by young American Sailors and pilots wearing dungarees and khakis. So to make that connection with them we are wearing our flight suits, our flight deck jerseys along with our Navy working uniforms, to pay honor to those young Sailors who stared everything in the face, when everything was on the table and rose to the occasion.\"\n\"We come together today to honor the brave men who fought to defend Midway, they were just ordinary Americans who responded to the call to serve their nation, but at Midway they were heroes,\" said guest speaker Commander, Naval Air Forces Pacific, Vice. Adm. Thomas J. Kilcline.\nFish, whose father served in the Navy during World War II, recalled the huge impact that one naval battle had on not just the Navy, but countless individuals as well.\n\"The battle changed the tide of the war,\" he said. \"I remember my father saying that things looked bleak.

{"question":"How do electromagnetic fields interact with particles at both the classical and quantum levels, specifically regarding the transmission of forces and energy conservation?","answer":"In classical electromagnetics, as described by Maxwell's Equations, electric and magnetic fields interact with charged particles through direct field interactions - electric fields diverge from positive charges and converge on negative charges, while magnetic fields form closed loops around currents. These equations explain phenomena from hair standing on end to power generation in turbines. At the quantum level, however, these interactions are mediated by photons, which are the quanta of the electromagnetic force. When two electrons repel each other, they exchange virtual photons that carry energy and momentum, causing the electrons to recoil in opposite directions. These interactions must conserve energy, following Einstein's E = mc² equation. This becomes evident when electrons and positrons annihilate, converting their mass into photons, or when photons can strike particles with mass and charge out of the vacuum, demonstrating the complex interplay between matter, energy, and forces at the quantum level.","context":["This article was initially written as part of the IEEE STARS program.\nMaxwell’s Equations provide a complete description of electromagnetic phenomena and underpin all modern information and communication technologies. They are named after James Clerk Maxwell, the Scottish physicist whose pioneering work during the second half of the 19th century unified the theories of electricity, magnetism, and light.

They are named after James Clerk Maxwell (Figure 1), the Scottish physicist whose pioneering work unified the theories of electricity, magnetism, and light. Today, Maxwell’s Equations are the essential tool of electrical engineers, used to design all electrical and electronic equipment from cell phones to satellites, televisions to computers and power stations to washing machines. The theory of electromagnetism was built on the discoveries and advances of many scientists and engineers, but the pivotal contribution was that of Maxwell, who during the second half of the 19th century made the huge conceptual leaps that would enable the great advances in electrical technology throughout the 20th century.\nThe four equations\nTo set the context for the discovery and development of Maxwell’s Equations it is first important to understand what they are. In the modern context, Maxwell’s Equations refer to a set of four relations that describe the properties and interrelations of electric and magnetic fields. The equations are shown in modern notation in Figure 2. The electric force fields are described by the quantities E (the electric field) and D = εE (the electric displacement), the latter including how the electrical charges in a material become polarized in an electric field. The magnetic force fields are described by H (the magnetic field) and B = µH (the magnetic flux density), the latter accounting for the magnetization of a material.\nThe equations can be considered in two pairs. The first pair consists of Equation 1 and Equation 2. Equation 1 describes the electric force field surrounding a distribution of electric charge ρ. It shows that the electric field lines diverge from areas of positive charge and converge onto areas of negative charge (Figure 3). Equation 2 shows that magnetic field lines curl to form closed loops (Figure 4), with the implication that every north pole of a magnet is accompanied by a south pole. The second pair, Equation 3 and Equation 4, describes how electric and magnetic fields are related. Equation 3 describes how a time-varying magnetic field will cause an electric field to curl around it. Equation 4 describes how a magnetic field curls around a time-varying electric field or an electric current flowing in a conductor.\nThese equations can explain how your hair stands on end when you remove your nylon sweater, how a compass needle always points north, how a power station turbine can generate electricity, and how a loudspeaker can convert an electric current into sound. When combined these equations also describe the transmission of radio waves and the propagation of light.\nThe emergence of electromagnetism\nThe sciences of electricity and magnetism and their fusion as electromagnetism evolved through a series of advances from many different scientists. To name all involved would amount to writing a Who’s Who of 18th and 19th century physics. Here we will concentrate on the contributions most directly related to the development of Maxwell’s Equations. The advances through the 18th century in understanding electric charges and currents, notably the work of Benjamin Franklin and Alessandro Volta culminated in the work of Charles Coulomb, whose law showed that the strength of electric force varied inversely with the square of the distance to a positively or negatively charged object. This law, and a similar one for magnets, was later generalized by the work of Poisson and Gauss in the early 19th century leading to Gauss’ Law, the physics behind the first of Maxwell’s Equations.\nUp to this time, the laws of electricity and the laws of magnetism were regarded as two separate fields of physics. This changed in September 1820 while Hans Christian Ørsted was setting up a demonstration for a lecture in Copenhagen: he discovered that an electric current can deflect the magnetic needle of a compass. News of Ørsted’s discovery spread quickly across Europe, and within a week Andre Ampère had shown the French Academy of Science in Paris that parallel currents in two wires attract each other, while opposite currents would repel. Soon after, Jean-Baptiste Biot and Philippe Savart showed the same forum how the strength of the force falls away with distance to the wire. Ampère’s relentless scientific efforts over the next six years founded the field of electrodynamics, with at times fortnightly reports to the French Academy of Sciences and the publication of his general law connecting electric currents with magnetic forces. Ampère’s work elegantly combined experiments and theory. Maxwell later described this as “one of the most beautiful achievements in science . . . from the brain of the Newton of electricity.”\nElectromagnetism became a focus for the most eminent scientists of the 19th century. Of these the work of three men, Ampere, William Thomson, and Michael Faraday, would most directly influence Maxwell. Thomson, who later became Lord Kelvin, was a good friend of Maxwell’s, and the two regularly corresponded to discuss their scientific theories. The experiments of Michael Faraday, however, would have the greatest direct impact. Faraday was a self-educated scientist and exceptionally skilled experimentalist. During the 1820s and 1830s he made several key discoveries. He showed that a changing current in one circuit would induce a current in a neighboring circuit through a change in magnetic flux around the wires. He established how materials respond to electric fields, and this work led to the concepts of dielectric constant and polarization. (Thomson later devised the corresponding concepts for magnetism.) Through hundreds of experiments, Faraday showed that these effects could all be explained pictorially, using lines of force that fill the space around charges and currents. This was a new paradigm in physics - the force field - that would most strongly influence Maxwell.\nBy the mid 19th century the various laws of electricity and magnetism were becoming well understood, and a common theory that could describe all phenomena was sought. Faraday’s vision of lines of force pervading space was radical, and the prevailing opinion of his contemporaries was that a theory should instead be based on forces acting at a distance, directly from one particle to another. On this basis Wilhelm Weber developed a theory linking Ampère’s and Faraday’s laws. However his theory was flawed as it required a condition that broke the law of energy conservation. Maxwell believed that Faraday was correct and in the 1850s, as a Fellow at the University of Cambridge, set about deriving a mathematical description of Faraday’s theory. In the paper \"On Faraday’s Lines of Force,\" Maxwell used a fluid analogy to derive his first theory of electromagnetic force fields. The fluid analogy was limited in that it could describe only fields around static charges and steady electric currents. Maxwell also formulated mathematics for Faraday’s concepts of induced currents, but could not interpret these within the fluid model.\nAfter a period focused on other topics, including color perception and the dynamics of Saturn’s rings, Maxwell returned to the problem of electromagnetism with a completely new theory. Now Professor of Natural Philosophy at King’s College London, Maxwell published the new theory in four parts between 1861 and 1862 in his landmark work “On Physical Lines of Force.” Here Maxwell devised a mechanical model that could account for all the known electromagnetic phenomena. His mechanical construct featured spinning cells and idle wheels that mimic the curling magnetic fields around currents in conductors. This gave a successful though somewhat improbable analogy that could describe Ampère’s, Faraday’s, and Gauss’ laws. Indeed Maxwell was careful to convey at the end of part II of “On Physical Lines of Force” that this model was an analogy and not a suggestion of the real mechanism.\nAt this stage the theory was successful but as yet incomplete, for it did not properly describe current flow through electrical capacitors. Maxwell contemplated this problem during the summer of 1861 while “in the country” at his family estate Glenlair in southwest Scotland. There he realized that if he made his mechanical construct elastic it would allow changing electric currents to propagate through non-conductors as they do in capacitors, and thereby corrected Ampère’s Law with a new term called the electric displacement current. This correction completed the essential physics of the theory and was published in the final two parts of “On Physical Lines of Force” in 1862. However, his original equations were in a quite different mathematical form from those used today.\nMaxwell’s correction to his model had a dramatic implication. He realized that if the electromagnetic medium was elastic, then it would support oscillating waves. While at Glenlair he calculated a formula for the speed of these waves, and on his return to King’s College London in the fall of 1861 he found that this speed very closely matched the speed of light as measured by Hippolyte Fizeau. Maxwell commented “The velocity of transverse undulations in our hypothetical medium, calculated from the electro-magnetic experiments of MM. [Friedrich] Kohlrausch and [Wilhelm] Weber, agrees so exactly with the velocity of light calculated from the optical experiments of M. Fizeau, that we can scarcely avoid the inference that light consists in the transverse undulations of the same medium which is the cause of electric and magnetic phenomena.”\nThe contrived mechanical analogy and radical idea of force fields meant that others were slow to accept Maxwell’s theory. Three years later Maxwell published his third theory of electromagnetism. This was based only on the laws of dynamics, and so stripped away the mechanical scaffolding supporting his earlier model. In \"A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field,\" Maxwell collected together his equations of the electromagnetic field (Figure 5) and explicitly wrote down the electromagnetic wave equation. This paper was another landmark of physics in that it presented a theory that described all the known phenomena, but was independent of any underlying mechanical mechanism. This ultimately changed the way that physicists approached the development of new physical laws.\nMaxwell subsequently left King’s College London and over the next six years worked as an independent scholar at Glenlair. During this time he wrote his magnum opus A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, published in 1873. In the Treatise he summarized the current state of knowledge of electromagnetism, presenting and developing his work alongside the theories of others. He further developed the mathematics, interpretation, and applications of his equations, and rewrote them in a more compact mathematical notation known as quaternions.\nOver the next two decades Maxwell’s theory was accepted and advanced by others, notably Oliver Heaviside, Heinrich Hertz, and Hendrik Lorentz. Heaviside championed the Faraday-Maxwell approach to electromagnetism and simplified Maxwell’s original set of 20 equations to the four used today. Importantly, Heaviside rewrote Maxwell’s Equations in a form that involved only electric and magnetic fields. Maxwell’s original equations had included both fields and potentials. In an analogy to gravity, the field corresponds to the gravitational force pulling an object onto the Earth, while the potential corresponds to the shape of the landscape on which it stands. By configuring the equations only in terms of fields, Heaviside simplified them to his so-called Duplex notation, with the symmetry evident in the equations of Figure 2. He also developed the mathematical discipline of vector calculus with which to apply the equations. Heaviside analysed the interaction of electromagnetic waves with conductors and derived the telegrapher’s equations of Kirchhoff from Maxwell’s theory to describe the propagation of electrical signals along a transmission line.\nIndependently of Heaviside, Heinrich Hertz also derived a simplified version of Maxwell’s Equations, although he later acknowledged the precedence of Heaviside’s work. In 1888 Hertz made his most significant contribution with the discovery of radio waves. This confirmed Maxwell’s prediction of electromagnetic waves and thus validated the theory. Other notable contributions to electromagnetic wave theory include the work of Lorentz, Ludwig Boltzmann, and Hermann Helmholtz who developed Maxwell’s Equations to describe the propagation of light including reflection and refraction at surfaces.\nEntering the 20th century, Maxwell’s Equations had impact beyond electromagnetism in the discovery of the theory of relativity and, decades later, the field equations of quantum mechanics. The work of both Hendrik Lorentz and Albert Einstein in deriving the theory of relativity was directly founded on the constant speed of light from Maxwell’s Equations. Einstein regarded Maxwell’s work as “the most profound and the most fruitful that physics has experienced since the time of Newton.” Quantum mechanics, though less clearly linked to electromagnetism, was nonetheless founded on the Faraday-Maxwell paradigm of the field theory. It should be noted that Maxwell based his theory on the concept of an aether, that is, an invisible all-penetrating medium through which the electromagnetic fields propagate. While it was established in 1892 after Maxwell’s death that no aether exists, the equations remain valid in their description of all electromagnetic phenomena.\nThe equations of electromagnetism have previously been known as the Hertz-Heaviside and Maxwell-Hertz Equations, but the term 'Maxwell’s Equations' was popularized by Einstein in 1940, in his monograph Considerations Concerning the Fundamentals of Theoretical Physics. In the modern context, Maxwell’s Equations are used in the design of all types of electrical and electronic equipment. The equations can only be solved exactly for simple structures of high symmetry. However the dramatic increase in computing power and development of numerical finite-difference techniques since the mid 1960s have enabled their widespread everyday use.\n- 1785, Coulomb’s Law is published\n- 1812, Poisson’s Law is published\n- 1813, Gauss’ Divergence Theorem is discovered\n- 1820, H.C.

Schumm\nSummary and review of the above chapter\nINTRODUCTION: The ability of particles possessing mass and charge to be annihilated, and charge carriers such as photons to be absorbed by such particles could be argued to make it difficult to view quanta as something fundamental.\nQuantum field theory, which was developed between the 1920s and the 1940s, represents an attempt to make quantum theory more compatible with relativity. In physics, a field constitutes properties that can be measured at every point in a particular region. With an electrically charged particle, which can attract or repel other charged particles, its electrical field is just the strength and direction of the force on the other particles. The force felt by a particle placed in an electric or other field is the value of the force at a particular location in space and time multiplied by the charge of a particle placed in that existing field.\nElectrons and photons\nIn the case of two electrons, which carry negative charge, there is a repellent force between them as a result of the exchange of photons, which are the quanta of the electromagnetic force. It is pointed out that this quantum description of the force between particles involving a photon is the opposite of the classical physics conception that forces such as gravity or electromagnetism acted at a distance.\nThe photons that carry the repellent force of charge between the electrons are created out of the vacuum by the presence of the electrons, and they disappear again after the exchange between the electrons. In quantum field theory, the electromagnetic force is the result of the exchange of such virtual photons. A distinction is made between virtual photons created out of the vacuum, and non-virtual or ‘real’ photons emitted by a light source. Any force is seen as a consequence of the exchange of quanta appropriate to that force. Photons are the field quanta of the electromagnetic force, in the same way that ‘W’ and ‘Z’ bosons convey the weak nuclear force, and gluons convey the strong nuclear force.\nFeynman diagrams enabled visualisation of the behaviour of quanta in time and space. By convention, movement in space is plotted according to a horizontal labelled ‘x’ at the bottom of the graph, and passage in time according to a vertical labelled ‘t’ at the side of the graph. As an example, two electrons approach one another; at a point ‘A’ one electron emits a photon carrying energy and momentum away from the electron that emits it, and this causes that electron to recoil. The photon that has been emitted is absorbed by the other electron, which recoils in the opposite direction to the first electron.\nThis relationship represents the mutual repulsion of two negatively charges electrons. The relationship could be the other way round, with the second electron emitting the photon, or with both electrons emitting photons. However, in quantum mechanics the exchange is seen to be a probability of an exchange involving one photon, and a probability of an exchange involving two photons; in fact any number of photons can be exchanged. Each of myriad possibilities for such an exchange can be represented by a Feynman diagram. The Feynman diagram contact point between the electrons and the photons are referred to as vertices.\nAn object with angular momentum has kinetic energy, but may not be moving anywhere, but instead simply turning at a fixed point in the manner of a spinning top. Electrons also spin about their axes. The angular momentum or spin of a quanta is a fixed property, and its speed cannot be varied. The angular momentum of electrons is expressed as spin ½, while photons are spin 1. Electrons are part of the class of quanta known as fermions with spins that are odd number multiples of a ½, and this type of particle has mass and charge. The class of quanta with integer multiples of spin are known as bosons and convey forces as with the electromagnetic force. When an electric charge is in motion, which includes the motion of rotating about its axis, it creates magnetic fields. The property of magnetism relates to the angular momentum or spin ½ of electrons conceived as spinning about their axes.\nIn the Schrödinger equation, the kinetic energy of a particle’s motion and the potential energy of resisting a force is equal to the total energy of the system, so long as it is not disturbed from outside. But in relativistic field theory, we are dealing with the exchange of field quanta rather than potential energy.\nProblems within negative values arising in the equations of quantum mechanics were resolved by the concept of antimatter, such as the positron, which is the positively charges antimatter opposite number of the electron. If a negatively charged electron and a positively charged positron collide, they annihilate one another, meaning that their energy is converted into photons. According to the first law, the energy of particles is always conserved. In this collision, mass is converted into energy, demonstrating the famous Einstein equation, E = mc2 where E is the energy of the system and ‘m’ is its mass. But the ability of particles possessing mass and charge to be annihilated and charge carriers such as photons to be absorbed by such particles could be argued to make it difficult to view quanta as something fundamental.\nWhere two electrons interact via a photon it is possible for the photon to momentarily fluctuate into an electron-positron pair before being converted back into a photon. Heisenberg uncertainty principle, in which uncertainty also applies to the mass of particles, means that over a sufficiently short space of time a massless particle can be converted into something with mass. Again this might be seen to undermine the concept of the quanta as something fundamental.\nFurther to this, a momentary fluctuation of a virtual photon into an electron-positron pair can collide with a non-virtual photon and can be transformed by absorbing the photon’s energy into a real and persisting electron and positron. Thus light can strike particles with mass and charge out of the vacuum. This confirms the existence of a seething mass of electron-positron pairs in the vacuum. It is pointed out that in the nature of quantum mechanics there would be an infinite number of electron-photon interaction including an infinite number of electron-positron pairs. Renormalisation, a calculation applied in quantum field theory, is a way of taking account of these infinite fluctuations when measuring an electron.Tags: electric field, electrons, Feynman diagram, photons, positrons, quantum field, quantum mechanics Posted by"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:a6107285-f640-4921-b0b8-bb67c2f390e5>","<urn:uuid:98735e9e-60ed-4346-a68d-7e0e53c75731>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does overseas product development timing and scheduling work, and what are the key considerations for shipping methods between air and ocean freight?","answer":"Product development overseas involves multiple time-intensive steps. First, factories typically need 2-3 weeks for samples, plus 4-5 days for air shipping samples. For the full production process, it requires 60-90 days of manufacturing time. After production, shipping options include air freight (7-10 days total) or ocean freight (45 days total). When choosing between air and ocean freight, several factors must be considered: Air freight is significantly more expensive but faster, while ocean freight is more cost-effective but slower. Air freight is recommended for shipments under 100 pounds, perishable goods, or high-value merchandise. Ocean freight is typically the most economical option and has a lower environmental impact, though it requires more extensive planning due to longer transit times.","context":["Not all design is just a drawing, painting or a concept in your head. You have to start with the reality of production in order to plan a successful product. In order to lay a foundation to your upcoming designs you will need a schedule. That scheduling is a pivotal point in any design. I will provide an example of scheduling and how it can effect the out come of an efficient design.\nIf you are developing a product over seas you will need to keep in mind that time is always a factor. I have developed thousands of products over seas and every single product takes an exorbitant amount of time to develop. There is more to a product than just designing a product and sending it in to a factory. You have to know all the factor's associated with your product and plan them accordingly.\nLets start with the basics then dig into the actual schedule. What is the product, where will it be produced, does it need trims and when do you want it to hit stores. A good example would be a shirt, it will be made in China, and we need it for our Spring assortment. Now that we have a base, lets see how to make our schedule.\nAll factory's will roughly know how long it will take to make samples or production. Most factory's will produce a sample in 2/3 weeks which will not included the 4/5 days it takes to air your sample in to the country. Shirt production usually takes about 60 to 90 days. Shipping these products will be done one of two ways, by air or by boat. Air shipments take roughly 7 days and boat shipments from China take roughly 45 days. These shipments include passing through customs and being delivered directly. Now production sampling and production has been laid out, although there are other factor's that play into your product. If your going directly into production for your own store you can move forward with production right after the samples are approved. If you have to pre-book your line in order to make production, you will have to add that planning into your schedule.\nOnce you have approved samples or pre-production samples you can pre-line these products with some of you top accounts. Pre-lineing is a great way to narrow down your assortment and secure sales with your top accounts. Allow yourself about 2 weeks to pre-line your line. Depending on the feed back you may have to to make some small changes before you move forward with salesmen samples. Salesmen samples take roughly 4 weeks to produce depending on how many you will need. If you have over a 100 sales reps you will have to treat it like a production run. If you have a smaller team you can have salesmen samples (SMS) turned in 4 weeks. While you are pre-lining your products you should begin setting up photoshoots to get assets for your line. The good news is when you start shooting products, it will be roughly the time of year you are selling them.\nOnce you have your line narrowed down, it is time to do two things, order salesmen samples and start preparing marketing materials. Lucky for you, you have already set up all your photoshoots which means that your assets should be shot around the same time you started putting together all your collateral for marketing. Once salesmen samples reach your sales reps you should allow roughly 6 weeks to pre-book the line. This number may very depending on the size of your sales force and their territories. If your new to pre-books then 6 weeks is a good amount of time for your reps to visit accounts.\nFinally you have come to the end of your pre-books and it is time to tally up your orders. Once you determine how many orders you have you will need to place a purchase order (PO) to your factory for production. Production should take anywhere from 60-90 days (not including Feburary due to Chinese New Year). Be sure when you order the product that you order the same amount of hang tags/misc trims to be produced with your products. Before your products are finished you should come to a conclusion how to get your products to the warehouse. You have 2 options when it comes to shipping. The more expensive but fast route is by air. It takes roughly 7-10 days to have your product shipped by air. This number includes customs and door to door service. Your other option, which is substantially cheaper is shipment by boat. Boat shipments takes roughly 45 days with customs and door to door service.","10 Common Questions About Importing Your Goods via Ocean Freight\nHere are the 10 most common questions we hear (and answers) about shipping via ocean:\n1. How long does it take to receive my cargo?\nMany factors can influence shipping times: for example, the origin and destination of the shipment, or if you’re shipping a less than container load (LCL), etc. Generally, however, if you are importing goods from one of the main ports in China to Los Angeles or Long Beach, you’re looking at approximately two weeks on the water.\nHowever, don’t expect your goods to be in your hands within 14 days. Once your goods arrive at port, they must be unloaded from the vessel, become available for pickup and then be delivered to your door (that is assuming they already cleared customs).\nShipping LCL adds additional time to the overall transit. This is due to the extra steps of consolidating your shipment with cargo from other shippers at the origin and then deconsolidating it at the destination. These steps occur at a specialized warehouse called a container freight station (CFS).\n2. Why do rates change?\nThere are a few reasons the shipping rates of a freight forwarder can change:\nGRI: This stands for General Rate Increase, which, simply put, is when ocean carriers raise rates in a particular trade lane. While GRIs can take place throughout the year, you can typically count on one happening on May 1st which marks the beginning of a new 12-month “contract season” between shippers and carriers.\nSupply/Demand: Ocean shipping rates increase during certain times of the year, especially when demand for space is high. One of these times is referred to as the “peak season.” The traditional peak season roughly spans July through October and coincides with the rush of cargo ahead of the holiday shopping season. Since retailers are looking to have products on shelves for Black Friday, shipping rates will tend to increase in the preceding months.\nThe Lunar New Year (Chinese New Year) holiday is another period that is impacted by supply and demand. Many countries in Asia shutter factories for two weeks or longer to celebrate. As a result, the weeks prior to the shutdown see a surge in cargo and rates. The Lunar New Year start date varies each year but occurs between late January and February.\nCost of Oil: Just like the cost of gas for our cars, a shipper’s rate may increase or decrease due to the cost oil. Changes are reflected in the bunker adjustment factor (BAF). Bunker fuel is the term for the fuel oil used in vessels.\nThe best way to stay on top of rate fluctuations is to work with a reliable international freight forwarder, who can keep you informed on market conditions.\n3. Do I need insurance?\nShort answer: It’s always recommended.\nLong answer: While you don’t need marine cargo insurance and aren’t required to buy it, having it is usually a good investment. Just as with home or car insurance, you’re protecting yourself from potential damages or losses that may occur. Specifically, marine cargo insurance can cover damage, loss, theft, non-delivery, etc., while your goods are in transit.\nOne thing that makes marine insurance different than your home or car insurance is a concept called “General Average.” A general average scenario occurs when some cargo is voluntarily sacrificed in an effort to save the voyage. This could come in the form of jettisoning some containers to stabilize the ship in a severe storm. General Average states that all cargo owners are responsible and will share in the loss (even if your cargo wasn’t actually lost). Marine insurance can protect you against a general average situation and avoid the additional expenses with retrieving your cargo.\n4. Wouldn’t it be easier to allow my supplier to handle the shipment?\nYes and no. While it may be “easier” by giving your supplier the responsibility, there are many disadvantages. One issue is compliance. For example, who will be filing your Importer Security Filing (ISF)? Ultimately, the ISF importer will be responsible for any mistakes or liquidated damage penalties for noncompliance.\nAnother issue is control. If your supplier is handling their shipments, that means they’re working with their freight forwarder to handle the transit process. That freight forwarder may not provide you with the ability to track your shipments, or even give you updates on your cargo. Communication problems with overseas forwarders can make scheduling deliveries to your warehouse difficult to coordinate and lead to unnecessary demurrage charges.\nWhat if you have more than one supplier? Keeping track of each different shipment can be a logistical nightmare in that case too.\nAt first, letting the supplier handle your shipment may sound appealing. However, as your business grows, it starts to become more of a burden than an asset. That’s why experts recommend that you control the shipping process by using your own international freight forwarder. They can help uncover more efficient ways of shipping such as building consolidations from multiple suppliers and offer tools to track every step of the shipping process.\nWant to learn more? Check out the other pros and cons of letting your supplier handle shipments here.\n5. Should I ship via air or ocean?\nA better question would be: How soon do you need your cargo? If you need it as soon as possible, air freight is a far faster shipping option than ocean freight. However, that speed comes with a cost — shipping rates for air freight are significantly higher. In most all cases, ocean freight will be the most cost-effective mode.\nThere are exceptions, of course: If your cargo is less than 100 pounds, shipping via air is often more cost-effective. Also, if your goods are perishable or sensitive (e.g., flowers or medicine), air freight is often the best option. Additionally, high-value merchandise may be better suited for air freight because of concerns over damage, theft, or the time value of money.\nEnvironmental impact may be another factor to consider. The carbon footprint of shipping via air freight is massive compared to ocean.\nBefore you start shipping via air, find out everything your freight forwarder wants you to know about air freight.\n6. How many pallets fit in a container?\nDepending on the pallet size, there are roughly 9 to 11 pallet spaces in a 20’ container and roughly 21 to 25 pallet spaces in a 40’ container.\nTo learn more about fitting pallets in a container, check out our chart on container dimensions.\n7. Is there a weight limit?\nYes. There are different weight limits depending on how you are shipping. For example, ocean freight usually has less weight restrictions than domestic freight. That’s because trucks can only carry so much weight; not to mention, state and federal laws govern how much a truck can carry on U.S. roads. The weight restrictions for trucks can range from 38,000 pounds to 44,000 pounds, depending on container size and other state restrictions. Tri-axle chassis are used for heavy loads.\n8. Why do I need to fill out a power of attorney (POA)?\nThere are two main reasons a POA for import shipments is required. If you hire a customs broker, they need to have the authority to conduct Customs business on your behalf.\nAlso, you will need a POA if your customs broker or international freight forwarder submits your Importer Security Filing (ISF) to U.S. Customs. The ISF must be submitted 24 hours before being loaded onto a U.S.-bound vessel, which gives time for customs to screen your cargo for any safety and security concerns. If the ISF doesn’t get to customs on time and accurately, you can face fees and penalties.\n9. When should I ship FCL vs LCL?\nThe larger your shipment is, the more likely you’ll want to ship full container load (FCL) to help reduce landed cost, potential handling damage, and receive your cargo faster.\nIf your shipment is less than 15 cubic meters (CBM), it will be more cost effective to move it as less than container load (LCL) cargo.\nYour international freight forwarder can help analyze market rates for your shipment to determine the breakeven point for shipping less than container load (LCL) or FCL.\n10. Why are the commercial invoice and packing list important?\nThey’re required by customs. Breaking it down, however, these two items are important for different reasons:\nCommercial invoice: Like other types of invoices, the commercial invoice describes the transaction happening between the exporter (your supplier) and importer (you). It lists your goods and the price you paid your supplier. Details on the commercial invoice will be used to determine the duties and taxes applicable to your shipment.\nPacking list: At first glance, the packing list may look similar to the commercial invoice. However, where the commercial invoice focuses on item prices, the packing list focuses on the physical count and breakdown of the related shipment. For example, a packing list would include the size, weight, and count of individual boxes/cartons matching a corresponding commercial invoice. Therefore, the packing list can be used in insurance claims to identify losses or by Customs when inspecting cargo or by your warehouse to reconcile what was expected vs. what was actually received.\nDo you have more questions about importing your goods via ocean?

{"question":"Which cosmonaut spent more time doing spacewalks: Fyodor Yurchikhin or Viktor Afanasyev?","answer":"Fyodor Yurchikhin has spent more time doing spacewalks. Prior to his 2017 spacewalk, Yurchikhin had accumulated 51 hours and 53 minutes across eight spacewalks. In comparison, Viktor Afanasyev performed 7 EVAs with a total time of 38 hours and 04 minutes.","context":["Two Russian Cosmonauts are set to venture outside the International Space Station on Thursday on a planned spacewalk of six hours and five minutes dedicated to a variety of tasks on the exterior of the Russian Segment. Veteran spacewalkers Fyodor Yurchikhin and Sergey Ryazansky will test a new version of Russia’s Orlan space suit, deploy five small satellites, install external experiments on the Russian segment and obtain microbial samples from the outer hull of ISS.\nThursday’s Russian Stage EVA is the seventh spacewalk taking place outside the International Space Station in 2017, coming after six U.S.-based spacewalks completed over the course of the year so far. Russian EVA-43 is the first Russian-Segment spacewalk since February 2016 when Yuri Malenchenko and Sergei Volkov retrieved and installed various external experiments on the Russian Segment.\nThursday’s EVA will be carried out by two experienced spacewalkers and the only two Russian crew members of ISS after Roscosmos reduced its permanent Station crew to only two members as a cost-saving measure and to respond to current workload requirements on the Russian Segment.\nFyodor Yurchikhin is a veteran of eight previous spacewalks, having performed his first EVA in 2007 and raking up a total EVA time of 51 hours and 53 minutes, ranking seventh on the all-time record list with prospects of moving into fourth if Thursday’s EVA runs the planned duration. Sergey Ryazansky conducted three previous EVAs for a total of 20 hours and 5 minutes including the highly publicized November 2013 spacewalk that took the Olympic Torch into the vacuum of space before being flown back to Earth to light the Olympic Flame for the 2014 Winter Games held in Sochi.\nYurchikhin will be the lead spacewalker on Thursday wearing Orlan-MKS No. 4 with blue stripes while Ryazansky, designated EV-2, will wear Orlan-MK No. 6, also with blue stripes. The duo is scheduled to open the external hatch of the Pirs airlock at 14:41 UTC after several hours of EVA preparations that include suiting up and sealing off the Pirs module and PKhO Transfer Compartment that acts as a backup airlock for Russian spacewalks.\nThursday’s EVA will begin with the release of five small satellites flown up to the Space Station by several recent Progress missions, set for a collective release during the spacewalk. Unlike the U.S. CubeSat deployment infrastructure with sophisticated deployers and the Kibo Robotic Arm, Russia’s method of releasing satellites from ISS is rather low-key and involves a spacewalking crew member literally throwing the small satellites away to ensure a positive separation from ISS with a direction chosen to rule out any re-contact with the satellite on subsequent orbits.\nThe EVA procedure calls for Sergey Ryazansky egressing the airlock and setting up on the EVA ladder in front of Pirs. His first task will be the collection of photos and video of the “Restavratsiya” (Restoration) Experiment that was performed on the previous Russian EVA by applying a thermal protection foil to a plate which was then left exposed to the space environment to study how the material fares over time. Ryazansky will demate the plates and hand them to Yurchikhin for transfer into ISS and eventual return to the ground.\nNext will be the release of the five satellites, also to be completed by Ryazansky while Yurchikhin remains in Pirs to hand out the satellites with a total of 40 minutes budgeted for the satellite deployment, to be captured by a GoPro 360 camera.\nThe five satellites to be released during Thursday’s EVA are:\nTOMSK-TPU-120 is a 3U CubeSat from Tomsk Polytechnic University launched in March 2016 to test new satellite materials, featuring an all 3D-printed structure plus a handle to assist with the manual deployment. The 5-Kilogram satellite hosts an amateur radio payload and was first activated in May 2016 while still on board ISS to commemorate the 120th anniversary of Tomsk Polytechnic University.\nTNS-0 №2 is the second Tekhnologicesky Nanosputnik orbited under a program of Russia’s government-industry complex in cooperation with the Scientific Institute of Space Device Engineering. The first TNS satellite was released from ISS in March 2005 and No.2 will feature a number of upgrades, measuring 20 by 65cm in size and weighing 5.1 Kilograms. Its primary purpose is testing out new small satellite systems for power generation, attitude control and communications using the Globalstar satellite network and a UHF transceiver.\nRadioscaf RS-6 and RS-7, also known as Tanyusha SWSU №1 & №2, are two small satellites developed by Southwestern State University, Kursk. Both weigh in at around 4.8 Kilograms and use 3D printed structures, complying with the 3U CubeSat form factor but adding handles and fixed antennas as they do not need to fit into a CubeSat deployer. The two satellites feature communications systems that will be joined in a peer-to-peer type data network that could be used for the self-organization of large satellite constellations with a high degree of autonomy for adding new satellites to the network and removing failed ones. The network will support retransmission and parallel transmission to a ground monitoring station.\nRS-6 and 7 also carry SWSU-developed vacuum gauges to measure the density of neutral and charged particles in Earth’s upper atmosphere as a function of altitude. The amateur radio community can engage in the missions by receiving voice greetings from the satellites in four different languages.\nSfera-53 №2 (ТС530-Зеркало) is a follow-on to the first Sfera-53 released from ISS in August 2012. It is a passive spherical satellite measuring 53 centimeters in diameter and weighing 13 Kilograms for use in the calibration of ground-tracking equipment (either optical or radar) and to measure atmospheric density as a function of altitude by tracking the satellite’s orbital decay. Sfera-53 remained in orbit for around three months.\nWhen all satellites are deployed, the EVA clock should be reading PET+63 minutes at which point Yurchikhin will also be out of the airlock and the two spacewalkers will translate aft to the large diameter of the Zvezda Service Module. There, they will collect photos of the SKK No.9 exposure experiment before starting the installation of the “Impakt” experiment package.\nImpakt, to be installed on Plane I of Zvezda, will expose a number of material and coating samples to the space environment to study how different materials degrade in this challenging environment while also being exposed to exhaust from the Space Station’s thrusters, aiming to examine the scope of contamination and corrosion caused by thruster exhaust and propellant residue.\nThe two spacewalkers will put in place a hand rail and retrieve their GoPro camera before departing Zvezda and moving inboard – going through the standard procedure of wiping down their gloves and suits before throwing the towels overboard to remove potentially harmful contamination due to thruster residue and unburnt propellants accumulating around the aft section of Zvezda. Both EV crew members will stop by the airlock to retrieve equipment for the second half of the EVA before moving up to the Poisk module, installing a hand rails between MRM-2 and the Service Module along their way.\nAt Poisk, the crew members will get stated with the “Test” Experiment involving a series of samplers to collect surface samples from the outer protection layer of ISS and the windows. The Test Experiment aims to study how different materials behave in the challenging space environment over a long period of time characterized by harsh thermal variations, high doses of radiation and atomic oxygen causing corrosion. Test also looks at the distribution of thruster residue and potential microbial activity on the outside of the space station which has proven to be an interesting area of research based on the previous ten Test samples that have been returned so far.\nThe Test Samplers consist of pairs of collection devices for the acquisition of swab samples and containers to protect the samplers. Yurchikhin and Ryazansky will take samples from the BL-1 and 2 hatch areas on Poisk and also collect photos of another SKK experiment (No. 3) and install an Expose experiment unit.\nAlso at Poisk, the crew will change the positioning of the БКДО Plume Impingement and Deposit Monitoring Unit to view a different sector in its ongoing study of of the plumes created by the thrusters of visiting vehicles and the Space Station itself to learn more about the impingement characteristics of the thruster plumes and processes causing the deposition of combustion products on the external hull of the space station.\nYurchikhin and Ryazansky will install a sensor unit on the BL-2 hatch of Poisk and put in place hand rails between ports 6016 and 1505 before moving back down to the Pirs module where they will collect another pair of test samples and put in place exposure devices. Finally, the spacewalkers will go through a tool inventory and move back into the Pirs module to end the EVA in orderly fashion with repressurization.\nThe entire EVA will be used as a technology demonstration of the new Orlan-MKS space suit that offers greater capabilities and is geared to providing greater safety and comfort to spacewalking crew members.\nOrlan-MKS has been designed to be more robust than its predecessor while being much easier to use and operate, cutting time from the typical preparations flow for each spacewalk carried out on ISS. The suit has been built for up to 20 uses over a service life of six to seven years, capable of supporting extended spacewalks of up to nine hours. Changes to the older suits include the introduction of an automated thermal control system, a suit management computer that controls the temperature & monitors the suit’s life support functions, and a new, more durable material in the suit’s protective outer layers.\nThe more robust pressurization layer has an internal capability of withstanding failure, allowing a backup layer to be eliminated which makes the suit lighter and more flexible.\nFyodor Yurchikhin will evaluate the performance of Orlan-MKS for its first in-space test that follows extensive testing performed on the ground over the last five years.","Viktor Afanasyev (cosmonaut)\n||This biographical article needs additional citations for verification.

{"question":"Please explain how light exposure affects sleep patterns and what employers can do to address sleep problems in the workplace.","answer":"Light exposure significantly impacts sleep patterns - modern environments with artificial lighting mean we only get about one hour of natural sunlight daily, which affects melatonin production and circadian rhythms. Morning sunlight exposure and limiting evening LED light/screens are important for sleep regulation. For workplace solutions, employers can implement several measures including: providing sleep hygiene education, offering access to professional treatment, implementing stress management programs, allowing flexible schedules to accommodate rest needs, and being mindful of work expectations that might interfere with adequate sleep. These workplace interventions can help address sleep issues that affect employee productivity and safety.","context":["Replace the 8-hour myth with a reminder about core\nWhile sleep-need is\na very individual thing and age is also a big factor, it is generally accepted that adults up to the\nage of 65 need 7 – 9 hours of sleep a night, or 7 – 8-hours for those over 65.\nInterestingly, the census indicated that Kiwis are generally sleeping less than recommended and\ntwo-thirds of Kiwis in the study reported they often wake-up tired. Perhaps not surprisingly, three\nquarters of households with children wake up feeling tired.\nHowever, a preoccupation with the 8-hour myth can cause unnecessary stress and consequent sleep\nloss! It’s therefore more important that people start to become educated about core sleep\nIn sleep psychology we talk a lot about core sleep which is around 5 ½ hours a night. While\nthis is not necessarily enough sleep to help you feel your absolute best, it is considered enough to\nhelp you function and maintain your daily living. We liken it to eating the amount you need to stay\nhealthy, as compared to what you might choose to eat with additional treats, desserts, and favourite\nfoods thrown in!\nTry to replace the unhelpful myths around 8-hours of sleep and the idea of ‘sleep\ndebt’ that this creates, with a focus instead on the benefits of core sleep and the individual\ndifferences we have in our need for sleep. Given that insomnia is riddled with anxiety about loss of\nsleep, this can go a long way in terms of helping us feel more positive and less stressed about what\nwe are achieving!\nIn addition to a reduced quantity of sleep, Kiwis are also reporting issues with poor quality sleep.\nAlmost nine in 10 New Zealanders are waking up at least once in the night with 50% of people\nreporting that their sleep is commonly disrupted by feeling too hot or having body aches and pains\nthrough the night. Around 1 in 4 Kiwis are also feeling restless overnight due to insomnia, stress\nat work, anxiety, or feeling too cold. When awake through the night, we tend to think most\nfrequently about our lack of sleep or work stress.\nIt is estimated that our modern environment of artificial lighting and limited sun exposure\nmeans we only experience one hour of natural sunlight on average each day. Similarly, evening\nlighting, screens and devices hinder our exposure to true darkness. Given that the accumulation of\nour natural melatonin is related to our daily exposure to light and darkness, it is important that\nwe optimise our circadian rhythm and keep it as regular as we can.\nWe can best prepare for the next night first thing in the morning by getting straight into the\nsunlight (opening curtains, sitting in a sunny spot). Similarly, turning off devices, limiting LED\nlighting or using screen filters will also best prepare us for sleep at night-time. If you struggle\nwith falling asleep, ensure you are maximising your exposure to sunlight early in the day.\nAlternatively, if you struggle with middle-of-the-night awakenings try to stay in the light as long\nas possible, perhaps taking a late afternoon walk and not closing curtains too early.","Mental Health Topics\nOn this page:\nInsomnia is Costly to the Workplace\nResearch suggests that insomnia costs employers more than $90 billion annually in reduced productivity and workplace accidents and errors. With as many as one-fifth of working Americans reportedly experiencing insomnia over the past year, sleeplessness is clearly a major public health issue with implications that extend beyond the bedroom.\nInsufficient sleep is considered a major public health concern and one that affects as many as 50 to 70 million Americans (Colton et al., 2006). The term “sleep disorder” is wide ranging and can describe numerous types of sleep difficulties, including short sleep duration, unsatisfactory sleep quality despite having adequate duration (often termed non-restorative sleep), breathing-related sleep disruptions (e.g., snoring, sleep apnea), nightmares or night terrors, and problematic sleep behaviors (e.g., restless legs syndrome, sleepwalking).\nDespite differences in their symptoms and causes, sleep disorders as a whole are associated with a host of negative outcomes, such as an increased risk of certain medical diseases (e.g., cancer, hypertension, obesity) and mental disorders (particularly depression); higher mortality; increased suicidal thoughts and behaviors; and poorer quality of life. Sleep disturbances also contribute significantly to motor vehicle accidents, workplace errors and accidents, and reduced productivity due to absenteeism and work impairment (Swanson et al., 2011).\nWhat is Insomnia Disorder?\nInsomnia disorder is one of the most common sleep disturbances, occurring in approximately one in three working U.S. adults (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2012). While many individuals may use the term insomnia to describe the experience of insufficient sleep, insomnia disorder is a mental disorder that can only be diagnosed when specific criteria are met. The criteria are listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), the handbook that psychiatrists, other physicians, and mental health professionals use to guide diagnosis of a mental disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 2013).\nInsomnia disorder is defined by the presence of poor sleep characterized by:\n- difficulty falling asleep (known as delayed sleep onset or initial insomnia);\n- difficulty staying asleep (known as sleep maintenance insomnia or middle insomnia), and/or wakening early and being unable to return to sleep (termed late insomnia);\n- In order to be diagnosed, the sleep disturbance must negatively impact a person’s functioning in important areas, such as work or school, completing daily responsibilities, or maintaining interpersonal relationships. Symptoms must be experienced for at least three nights per week for at least three months, despite having adequate opportunities for sleep.\nCharles F. Reynolds III, MD, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center endowed professor in geriatric psychiatry and chair of the DSM-5 work group that helped developed the latest insomnia disorder criteria, notes that the effects of the disorder are far-reaching in terms of its symptoms and impact throughout the body.\n“Insomnia disorder results in unmet sleep need, causing daytime problems, such as needing more time to process and react to information and having difficulty with complex thinking tasks, like problem solving. Further, irritability and other issues of mood regulation; difficulties interacting and maintaining relationships with others; and carbohydrate craving with weight gain can occur,” says Dr. Reynolds. “It is also a risk factor for the onset of common mental disorders, such as depression and substance use disorders.”\nIn fact, a recently published study in the Journal of the American Medical Association (Bernert, Turvey, Conwell, & Joiner, 2014) found that older adults (age 66 to 90 years) who reported poor sleep, including difficulty falling asleep and experiencing non-restorative sleep, had a 1.4-times greater risk of dying by suicide over the 10-year period in which the study was conducted.\nInsomnia in the Workplace\nGiven the scope of the impact of insomnia, it is not surprising that the disorder has been linked to problems in the workplace. The importance of adequate sleep and time away from work has increasingly become the subject of public discussion in light of revisions to work policies affecting positions of high risk to public safety, such as physician trainees, commercial airline pilots, and commercial vehicle drivers.\nThe most recent results from the America Insomnia Survey (AIS) support the idea that sleeplessness is negatively impacting the U.S. work environment (Shahly et al., 2012). Data were collected from 4,991 working Americans interviewed by telephone about insomnia and 18 other chronic medical conditions (e.g., cardiovascular, respiratory, and neurological disorders). An estimated 20% of those surveyed reported experiencing insomnia for at least 12 months, with even higher rates reported among women and workers age 45 to 64 years.\nResearchers found that insomnia was associated with approximately 7% of all costly workplace accidents and errors and almost 24% of the overall costs of all accidents and errors — higher than any of the other medical conditions examined. The total costs of accidents and errors attributed to insomnia were higher than costs due to other conditions by an average of $10,148 per incident. And the annual cost of insomnia-related workplace accidents and errors was estimated to be more than $32 billion.\nInsomnia also appears to compromise productivity, leading to missed days at work and low performance while at work. Recent data, also from the AIS, suggest the disorder results in significant reductions in work performance, yielding an annual rate of 11.3 days of lost work performance per individual with insomnia (Kessler et al., 2011). The study authors estimated that the annual cost of lost productivity due to insomnia is $59.8 billion.\nAlso, insomnia can be linked to certain other mental and medical disorders that themselves may impair work performance or attendance. Insomnia is considered a risk factor for anxiety and depression, both of which have a negative impact on participation in the labor market, likelihood of employment, and years of education (which in turn can affect employment status and earning potential). Cardiovascular and metabolic conditions that co-occur with insomnia disorder — such as diabetes, obesity, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia — are costly to treat and pose a substantial burden to workplace costs and productivity.\nTips for Employers\nOne of the more challenging aspects of treating insomnia stems from the fact that only a fraction of individuals with the disorder seek medical treatment (Morin, 2006). Poor sleep is so widespread that it is practically seen as normal in American society; consequently, many people often are not aware that a disorder is present and that treatment can help. Integration of insomnia management into employee wellness programs can help provide basic education to raise awareness about the seriousness of symptoms and the usefulness of formal medical treatment. Workplace wellness programs can educate employees about the variety of treatment options available while leveraging employee assistance programs to offer a variety of such interventions.\n- Sleep Hygiene Education: Sleep is a behavior and, like many other behaviors, can be altered by adopting new habits. Employee wellness programs should always include basic education on sleep hygiene to help workers shape healthier sleep routines on their own. This includes developing a regular schedule in which one goes to bed at the same time each night and wakens at the same time each morning; reducing environmental distractions, such as cell phones, televisions, and other electronics; and ensuring bedrooms are dark, quiet, and cool in temperature. Large meals, caffeine, and alcohol should be avoided close to bedtime.\n- Access to Professional Treatment: While improving sleep hygiene is often all that is needed to relieve insomnia, some individuals will need more formal treatment by a professional. Many of these treatments do not involve medication and can be extremely effective in restoring healthy sleep. Some individuals, in consultation with their physicians, may decide that short-term treatment with medication is the best course of action.\n- Stress Management Programs: Insomnia commonly emerges when people feel stressed—and vice versa: getting inadequate sleep itself can be incredibly stressful. Employee wellness programs that include approaches to stress management (such as mind-body exercises, engaging in relaxing activities, and maintaining a healthy lifestyle) can potentially help alleviate sleep disturbances as well.\n- Flexible Schedules: Employers also can contribute by allowing for flexible work schedules and reducing the need for late work days. If shift work is required, employers should be lenient in offering adjustable shift rotations to the extent possible so that workers stay well-rested.\n- Work Expectations: Finally, businesses should be vigilant about their internal policies regarding work expectations and hours. The drive to succeed that can result in pushing personnel to increase workloads can actually backfire and undermine productivity and results.\nThe health of a company starts with the health of its workers. Investing greater efforts into ensuring employees are well rested is likely to pay off many times over.\nA guide on Insomnia from one of the leading resources for sleep disorder information, the National Sleep Foundation, an organization dedicated to sleep health education and advocacy.\nEmily A.

{"question":"How does metabolism work in living organisms, and what happens when coral bleaching disrupts these processes?","answer":"Metabolism consists of chemical processes within living cells that maintain life, where substances are broken down for energy while others are synthesized. These processes produce energy, enable growth, and eliminate waste through complex enzymatic reactions. In coral specifically, metabolism depends on symbiosis with zooxanthellae algae for photosynthesis. When coral bleaching occurs, it disrupts this symbiosis, impairing photosynthesis and electron transport chains, which reduces the coral's photosynthetic capacity and can lead to coral mortality.","context":["Also found in: Thesaurus, Medical, Legal, Encyclopedia, Wikipedia.\n1.

{"question":"Can you explain the relationship between marine fishing regulations and forest carbon storage, particularly focusing on local community involvement and environmental impact?","answer":"Marine fishing regulations and forest carbon storage are interconnected through community-based conservation approaches and their environmental impacts. In marine areas, the enforcement of fishing regulations involves local communities through fishing cooperatives, with financial benefits from fines being reinvested to support these local groups. This community involvement is crucial in areas where people live meal-to-meal and need incentives to adapt their fishing practices. Similarly, in forest ecosystems, the preservation of large animals is vital for maintaining carbon storage capacity, as these animals disperse seeds of large, heavy-wooded trees that store significant amounts of carbon. The loss of these animals through hunting can reduce a tropical forest's carbon storage capacity by 5-20%. Both scenarios demonstrate how local community participation and species protection are essential for maintaining ecological balance and combating climate change.","context":["Like many threatened species, the Vulnerable Atlantic humpback dolphin (Sousa teuszii) is under pressure from anthropogenic activities. Industrial and commercial scale fishing forces locally-based artisanal fishers to within 200 metres of the beach – using their nets in critical habitat for this poorly understood marine mammal. In a recent field report to SOS Save our Species, who funded the work, Tim Collins from the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and IUCN CSG Member, reports on the impact of routine and frequent surveillance patrols in the waters of Conkouati-Douli National Park (CDNP), in the Republic of Congo – one of two project sites- to deter and intercept the trawlers that are deemed the root cause of the problem.\nAccording to project director, Tim Collins, patrols have intercepted 15 trawlers (both metal hulled and wooden vessels) fishing illegally in park waters since December 2013. He explains that with a limited number of eco-guards on a single patrol boat, it is difficult to board every illegal vessel in the area, and typically some flee during intercepts. More recently, park waters have become empty of trawlers during the day, but vessels have started to come in after dark, usually around 8-9pm, leaving again by 5-6am, while Tim and colleagues evaluate how to adapt to this new pattern of activity. One option being discussed is to head out late in the day, heading into deeper water under cover of darkness, anchoring at sea. Trawlers fishing illegally would be intercepted at first light when they are heading back out to sea, explains Tim, although this is not without risk, he adds!\nCommenting on intercepted fishing boats, Tim explains these are generally registered locally with crews comprising a mix of Congolese and Chinese expatriates. In each case, skippers and vessels’ paperwork were taken into custody and brought to land for prosecution, and in most cases, the vessels themselves were escorted to the anchorage near coastal villages to facilitate processing of fines and confiscation of gear. In addition some larger West African pirogues fishing with long filets dormant – bottom set gill nets often over 2.5km long – with Congolese, Beninese, Ghanaian and Senegalese crews, have also been found in the park. All of these have been made to recover their nets and advised on where park limits lay. These boats are treated more leniently although are always provided with a warning.\nCrucially, funds collected from the fines have been reinvested in strengthening enforcement in the national park with a part set aside for funding local fisheries cooperatives. This has been incredibly important for the project and fishers alike according to Tim. “We promised fishers that we would take action and in return they would honour an agreement to free the inshore strip – dolphin habitat. Being able to complete missions and return some of the financial benefits is critical and is helping to generate local support and buy-in”. This is extremely hard to do in a place where most people live from meal to meal and have very little room to make personal sacrifices, or risk loss such as moving their nets back into a risky area.\nWhile part of the solution involves removing the trawler threat, the project’s sustainable impact comes from improving stakeholder management of local fisheries, in conjunction with the creation of local fishing cooperatives to improve management of artisanal fisheries. The positive results of the marine patrols, along with the efficient and clear reinvestment of fine funds into park management and the creation of local fishing cooperatives, attest not only to the success of the conservation initiative but also to the interest of both national authorities and local communities to enforce regulations and improve the conservation prospects of coastal dolphins and other species within CNDP.

The decline of fruit-eating animals, such as large primates, tapirs and toucans, means that there is reduced seed dispersal of large trees and therefore fewer trees in forests to soak up global carbon dioxide emissions.\nA new study, published in Science Advances, has shown that hunting and poaching of large tropical animals could change the species composition of rainforests. Seed dispersal by large-bodied vertebrates is via the ingestion of viable seeds that pass through their digestive tracts intact. The removal of these animals from the ecosystem upsets the natural balance and leads to a loss of heavy-wooded large trees, and may reduce a tropical forest’s ability to store carbon by between 5 and 20%, depending on the trees species that are present in a given area.\nA research team from Brazil, Spain, Finland and the UK studied data from more than 2,000 trees species in Brazil’s Atlantic Forest, and more than 800 animal species. They found that fruit-eaters (frugivores) that are not targeted by hunters, such as small bats and birds, are only able to disperse small seeds from small trees. But large, heavy-wooded trees – the ones that capture and store greater amounts of carbon – are associated with larger seeds that can only be dispersed by large animals, those which are targeted by hunters.\nProfessor Mauro Galetti from São Paulo State University said: “The big frugivores, such as large primates, the tapir, the toucans, among other large animals, are the only ones able to effectively disperse plants that have large seeds. Usually, the trees that have large seeds are also big trees with dense wood that store more carbon.\nCarolina Bello, a PhD student from the São Paulo State University, added: “When we lose large frugivores we are losing dispersal and recruitment functions of large seeded trees and therefore, the composition of tropical forests changes. The result is a forest dominated by smaller trees with milder woods which stock less carbon.”\nProfessor Carlos Peres, from University of East Anglia’s School of Environmental Sciences, said: “Large birds and mammals provide almost all the seed dispersal services for large-seeded plants. Several large vertebrates are threatened by hunting, illegal trade and habitat loss. But the steep decline of the megafauna in overhunted tropical forest ecosystems can bring about large unforeseen impacts. We show that the decline and extinction of large animals will over time induce a decline in large hardwood trees. This in turn negatively affects the capacity of tropical forests to store carbon and therefore their potential to counter climate change.”\nTropical forests, especially the Amazon and Africa’s tropical rainforests, as well as the Atlantic forest, are the earth’s largest and densest natural carbon sinks. In their trunks and roots they store more than 25% of our carbon dioxide emissions. More research is needed before scientists can quantify the full effects but this study provides even more evidence that biological diversity and healthy forest ecosystems are essential if we are to have a healthy climate."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"long"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"informal_direct"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:6dfe3ed6-c2d5-47ab-8f02-d886a163e876>","<urn:uuid:3487c98d-1113-4d86-8fc9-ce9c68330ec3>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How does Android handle graphics rendering, and what tools can measure its UI performance?","answer":"Android handles graphics rendering through multiple components: developers can use Canvas (2D) or OpenGL ES APIs, with hardware acceleration enabled by default since Android 4.0. All rendering occurs on 'surfaces' managed by SurfaceFlinger, which composites visible surfaces onto the display using OpenGL and the Hardware Composer. The graphics pipeline includes BufferQueues that mediate between producers (like OpenGL ES games) and consumers (like SurfaceFlinger). For UI performance measurement, Android provides tools like 'dumpsys gfxinfo' which outputs frame timing data, including aggregate frame stats (showing metrics like janky frames percentage) and precise frame timing information. The framestats command provides detailed timestamps for the last 120 frames, showing time spent in different stages of the frame-producing pipeline.","context":["In this document\nThe Android framework offers a variety of graphics rendering APIs for 2D and 3D that interact with manufacturer implementations of graphics drivers, so it is important to have a good understanding of how those APIs work at a higher level. This page introduces the graphics hardware abstraction layer (HAL) upon which those drivers are built.\nApplication developers draw images to the screen in two ways: with Canvas or OpenGL. See System-level graphics architecture for a detailed description of Android graphics components.\nandroid.graphics.Canvas is a 2D graphics API and is the most popular graphics API among developers. Canvas operations draw all the stock and custom android.view.Views in Android. In Android, hardware acceleration for Canvas APIs is accomplished with a drawing library called OpenGLRenderer that translates Canvas operations to OpenGL operations so they can execute on the GPU.\nBeginning in Android 4.0, hardware-accelerated Canvas is enabled by default. Consequently, a hardware GPU that supports OpenGL ES 2.0 is mandatory for Android 4.0 and later devices. See the Hardware Acceleration guide for an explanation of how the hardware-accelerated drawing path works and the differences in its behavior from that of the software drawing path.\nIn addition to Canvas, the other main way that developers render graphics is by using OpenGL ES to directly render to a surface. Android provides OpenGL ES interfaces in the android.opengl package that developers can use to call into their GL implementations with the SDK or with native APIs provided in the Android NDK.\nAndroid implementers can test OpenGL ES functionality using the drawElements Quality Program, also known as deqp.\nAndroid graphics components\nNo matter what rendering API developers use, everything is rendered onto a \"surface.\" The surface represents the producer side of a buffer queue that is often consumed by SurfaceFlinger. Every window that is created on the Android platform is backed by a surface. All of the visible surfaces rendered are composited onto the display by SurfaceFlinger.\nThe following diagram shows how the key components work together:\nThe main components are described below:\nImage Stream Producers\nAn image stream producer can be anything that produces graphic buffers for consumption. Examples include OpenGL ES, Canvas 2D, and mediaserver video decoders.\nImage Stream Consumers\nThe most common consumer of image streams is SurfaceFlinger, the system service that consumes the currently visible surfaces and composites them onto the display using information provided by the Window Manager. SurfaceFlinger is the only service that can modify the content of the display. SurfaceFlinger uses OpenGL and the Hardware Composer to compose a group of surfaces.\nOther OpenGL ES apps can consume image streams as well, such as the camera app consuming a camera preview image stream. Non-GL applications can be consumers too, for example the ImageReader class.\nThe Android system service that controls a window, which is a container for views. A window is always backed by a surface. This service oversees lifecycles, input and focus events, screen orientation, transitions, animations, position, transforms, z-order, and many other aspects of a window. The Window Manager sends all of the window metadata to SurfaceFlinger so SurfaceFlinger can use that data to composite surfaces on the display.\nThe hardware abstraction for the display subsystem. SurfaceFlinger can delegate certain composition work to the Hardware Composer to offload work from OpenGL and the GPU. SurfaceFlinger acts as just another OpenGL ES client. So when SurfaceFlinger is actively compositing one buffer or two into a third, for instance, it is using OpenGL ES. This makes compositing lower power than having the GPU conduct all computation.\nThe Hardware Composer HAL conducts the other half of the work and is the central point for all Android graphics rendering. The Hardware Composer must support events, one of which is VSYNC (another is hotplug for plug-and-playHDMI support).\nThe graphics memory allocator (Gralloc) is needed to allocate memory requested by image producers. For details, see Gralloc HAL.\nSee the following diagram for a depiction of the Android graphics pipeline:\nThe objects on the left are renderers producing graphics buffers, such as the home screen, status bar, and system UI. SurfaceFlinger is the compositor and Hardware Composer is the composer.\nBufferQueues provide the glue between the Android graphics components. These are a pair of queues that mediate the constant cycle of buffers from the producer to the consumer. Once the producers hand off their buffers, SurfaceFlinger is responsible for compositing everything onto the display.\nSee the following diagram for the BufferQueue communication process.\nBufferQueue contains the logic that ties image stream producers and image stream consumers together. Some examples of image producers are the camera previews produced by the camera HAL or OpenGL ES games. Some examples of image consumers are SurfaceFlinger or another app that displays an OpenGL ES stream, such as the camera app displaying the camera viewfinder.\nBufferQueue is a data structure that combines a buffer pool with a queue and uses Binder IPC to pass buffers between processes. The producer interface, or what you pass to somebody who wants to generate graphic buffers, is IGraphicBufferProducer (part of SurfaceTexture). BufferQueue is often used to render to a Surface and consume with a GL Consumer, among other tasks. BufferQueue can operate in three different modes:\nSynchronous-like mode - BufferQueue by default operates in a synchronous-like mode, in which every buffer that comes in from the producer goes out at the consumer. No buffer is ever discarded in this mode. And if the producer is too fast and creates buffers faster than they are being drained, it will block and wait for free buffers.\nNon-blocking mode - BufferQueue can also operate in a non-blocking mode where it generates an error rather than waiting for a buffer in those cases. No buffer is ever discarded in this mode either. This is useful for avoiding potential deadlocks in application software that may not understand the complex dependencies of the graphics framework.\nDiscard mode - Finally, BufferQueue may be configured to discard old buffers rather than generate errors or wait. For instance, if conducting GL rendering to a texture view and drawing as quickly as possible, buffers must be dropped.\nTo conduct most of this work, SurfaceFlinger acts as just another OpenGL ES client. So when SurfaceFlinger is actively compositing one buffer or two into a third, for instance, it is using OpenGL ES.\nThe Hardware Composer HAL conducts the other half of the work. This HAL acts as the central point for all Android graphics rendering.\nSince Android graphics offer no explicit parallelism, vendors have long implemented their own implicit synchronization within their own drivers. This is no longer required with the Android graphics synchronization framework. See the Explicit synchronization section for implementation instructions.\nThe synchronization framework explicitly describes dependencies between different asynchronous operations in the system. The framework provides a simple API that lets components signal when buffers are released. It also allows synchronization primitives to be passed between drivers from the kernel to userspace and between userspace processes themselves.\nFor example, an application may queue up work to be carried out in the GPU. The GPU then starts drawing that image. Although the image hasn’t been drawn into memory yet, the buffer pointer can still be passed to the window compositor along with a fence that indicates when the GPU work will be finished. The window compositor may then start processing ahead of time and hand off the work to the display controller. In this manner, the CPU work can be done ahead of time. Once the GPU finishes, the display controller can immediately display the image.\nThe synchronization framework also allows implementers to leverage synchronization resources in their own hardware components. Finally, the framework provides visibility into the graphics pipeline to aid in debugging.","User interface (UI) performance testing ensures that your app not only meets its functional requirements, but that user interactions with your app are buttery smooth, running at a consistent 60 frames per second (why 60fps?), without any dropped or delayed frames, or as we like to call it, jank. This document explains tools available to measure UI performance, and lays out an approach to integrate UI performance measurements into your testing practices.\nMeasure UI performance\nIn order to improve performance you first need the ability to measure the performance of your system, and then diagnose and identify problems that may arrive from various parts of your pipeline.\ndumpsys is an Android tool that runs on the device and dumps interesting information about the status of system services. Passing the gfxinfo command to dumpsys provides an output in logcat with performance information relating to frames of animation that are occurring during the recording phase.\n> adb shell dumpsys gfxinfo <PACKAGE_NAME>\nThis command can produce multiple different variants of frame timing data.\nAggregate frame stats\nWith Android 6.0 (API level 23) the command prints out aggregated analysis of frame data to logcat, collected across the entire lifetime of the process. For example:\nStats since: 752958278148ns Total frames rendered: 82189 Janky frames: 35335 (42.99%) 90th percentile: 34ms 95th percentile: 42ms 99th percentile: 69ms Number Missed Vsync: 4706 Number High input latency: 142 Number Slow UI thread: 17270 Number Slow bitmap uploads: 1542 Number Slow draw: 23342\nThese high level statistics convey at a high level the rendering performance of the app, as well as its stability across many frames.\nPrecise frame timing info\nWith Android 6.0 comes a new command for gfxinfo, and that’s framestats which provides extremely detailed frame timing information from recent frames, so that you can track down and debug problems more accurately.\n>adb shell dumpsys gfxinfo <PACKAGE_NAME> framestats\nThis command prints out frame timing information, with nanosecond timestamps, from the last 120 frames produced by the app. Below is example raw output from adb dumpsys gfxinfo <PACKAGE_NAME> framestats:\n0,27965466202353,27965466202353,27965449758000,27965461202353,27965467153286,27965471442505,27965471925682,27965474025318,27965474588547,27965474860786,27965475078599,27965479796151,27965480589068, 0,27965482993342,27965482993342,27965465835000,27965477993342,27965483807401,27965486875630,27965487288443,27965489520682,27965490184380,27965490568703,27965491408078,27965496119641,27965496619641, 0,27965499784331,27965499784331,27965481404000,27965494784331,27965500785318,27965503736099,27965504201151,27965506776568,27965507298443,27965507515005,27965508405474,27965513495318,27965514061984, 0,27965516575320,27965516575320,27965497155000,27965511575320,27965517697349,27965521276151,27965521734797,27965524350474,27965524884536,27965525160578,27965526020891,27965531371203,27965532114484,\nEach line of this output represents a frame produced by the app. Each line has a fixed number of columns describing time spent in each stage of the frame-producing pipeline. The next section describes this format in detail, including what each column represents.\nFramestats data format\nSince the block of data is output in CSV format, it's very straightforward to paste it to your spreadsheet tool of choice, or collect and parse with a script. The following table explains the format of the output data columns. All timestamps are in nanoseconds.\n- Rows with a ‘0’ for the FLAGS column can have their total frame time computed by subtracting the INTENDED_VSYNC column from the FRAME_COMPLETED column.\n- If this is non-zero the row should be ignored, as the frame has been determined as being\nan outlier from normal performance, where it is expected that layout & draw take longer\nthan 16ms. Here are a few reasons this could occur:\n- The window layout changed (such as the first frame of the application or after a rotation)\n- It is also possible the frame was skipped in which case some of the values will have garbage timestamps. A frame can be skipped if for example it is out-running 60fps or if nothing on-screen ended up being dirty, this is not necessarily a sign of a problem in the app.\n- The intended start point for the frame. If this value is different from VSYNC, there was work occurring on the UI thread that prevented it from responding to the vsync signal in a timely fashion.\n- The time value that was used in all the vsync listeners and drawing for the frame (Choreographer frame callbacks, animations, View.getDrawingTime(), etc…)\n- To understand more about VSYNC and how it influences your application, check out the Understanding VSYNC video.\n- The timestamp of the oldest input event in the input queue, or Long.MAX_VALUE if there were no input events for the frame.\n- This value is primarily intended for platform work and has limited usefulness to app developers.\n- The timestamp of the newest input event in the input queue, or 0 if there were no input events for the frame.\n- This value is primarily intended for platform work and has limited usefulness to app developers.\n- However it’s possible to get a rough idea of how much latency the app is adding by looking at (FRAME_COMPLETED - NEWEST_INPUT_EVENT).\n- The timestamp at which input events were dispatched to the application.\n- By looking at the time between this and ANIMATION_START it is possible to measure how long the application spent handling input events.\n- If this number is high (>2ms), this indicates the app is spending an unusually long time processing input events, such as View.onTouchEvent(), which may indicate this work needs to be optimized, or offloaded to a different thread. Note that there are some scenarios, such as click events that launch new activities or similar, where it is expected and acceptable that this number is large.\n- The timestamp at which animations registered with Choreographer were run.\n- By looking at the time between this and PERFORM_TRANVERSALS_START it is possible to determine how long it took to evaluate all the animators (ObjectAnimator, ViewPropertyAnimator, and Transitions being the common ones) that are running.\n- If this number is high (>2ms), check to see if your app has written any custom animators or what fields ObjectAnimators are animating and ensure they are appropriate for an animation.\n- To learn more about Choreographer, check out the For Butter or Worse video.\n- If you subtract out DRAW_START from this value, you can extract how long the layout & measure phases took to complete. (note, during a scroll, or animation, you would hope this should be close to zero..)\n- To learn more about the measure & layout phases of the rendering pipeline, check out the Invalidations, Layouts and Performance video\n- The time at which the draw phase of performTraversals started. This is the start point of recording the display lists of any views that were invalidated.\n- The time between this and SYNC_START is how long it took to call View.draw() on all the invalidated views in the tree.\n- For more information on the drawing model, see Hardware Acceleration or the Invalidations, Layouts and Performance video\n- The time at which a sync request was sent to the RenderThread.\n- This marks the point at which a message to start the sync phase was sent to the RenderThread. If the time between this and SYNC_START is substantial (>0.1ms or so), it means that the RenderThread was busy working on a different frame. Internally this is used to differentiate between the frame doing too much work and exceeding the 16ms budget and the frame being stalled due to the previous frame exceeding the 16ms budget.\n- The time at which the sync phase of the drawing started.\n- If the time between this and ISSUE_DRAW_COMMANDS_START is substantial (>0.4ms or so), it typically indicates a lot of new Bitmaps were drawn which must be uploaded to the GPU.\n- To understand more about the sync phase, check out the Profile GPU Rendering video\n- The time at which the hardware renderer started issuing drawing commands to the GPU.\n- The time between this and FRAME_COMPLETED gives a rough idea of how much GPU work the app is producing. Problems like too much overdraw or inefficient rendering effects show up here.\n- The time at which eglSwapBuffers was called, relatively uninteresting outside of platform work.\n- All done! The total time spent working on this frame can be computed by doing FRAME_COMPLETED - INTENDED_VSYNC.\nYou can use this data in different ways. One simple but useful visualization is a histogram showing the distribution of frames times (FRAME_COMPLETED - INTENDED_VSYNC) in different latency buckets, see figure below. This graph tells us at a glance that most frames were very good - well below the 16ms deadline (depicted in red), but a few frames were significantly over the deadline. We can look at changes in this histogram over time to see wholesale shifts or new outliers being created. You can also graph input latency, time spent in layout, or other similar interesting metrics based on the many timestamps in the data.\nSimple frame timing dump\nIf Profile GPU rendering is set to In adb shell dumpsys gfxinfo\nin Developer Options, the\nadb shell dumpsys gfxinfo command prints out timing\ninformation for the most recent 120 frames, broken into a few different categories with\ntab-separated-values. This data can be useful for indicating which parts of the drawing pipeline\nmay be slow at a high level.\nSimilar to framestats above, it's very straightforward to paste it to your spreadsheet tool of choice, or collect and parse with a script. The following graph shows a breakdown of where many frames produced by the app were spending their time.\nThe result of running gfxinfo, copying the output, pasting it into a spreadsheet application, and graphing the data as stacked bars.\nEach vertical bar represents one frame of animation; its height represents the number of milliseconds it took to compute that frame of animation. Each colored segment of the bar represents a different stage of the rendering pipeline, so that you can see what parts of your application may be creating a bottleneck. For more information on understanding the rendering pipeline, and how to optimize for it, see the Invalidations Layouts and Performance video.\nControlling the window of stat collection\nBoth the framestats and simple frame timings gather data over a very short window - about two seconds worth of rendering. In order to precisely control this window of time - for example, to constrain the data to a particular animation - you can reset all counters, and aggregate statistics gathered.\n>adb shell dumpsys gfxinfo <PACKAGE_NAME> reset\nThis can also be used in conjunction with the dumping commands themselves to collect and reset at a regular cadence, capturing less-than-two-second windows of frames continuously.\nDiagnosing performance regressions\nIdentification of regressions is a good first step to tracking down problems, and maintaining high application health. However, dumpsys just identifies the existence and relative severity of problems. You still need to diagnose the particular cause of the performance problems, and find appropriate ways to fix them. For that, it’s highly recommended to use the systrace tool.\nFor more information on how Android’s rendering pipeline works, common problems that you can find there, and how to fix them, some of the following resources may be useful to you:\n- Rendering Performance 101\n- Why 60fps?\n- Android, UI, and the GPU\n- Invalidations, Layouts, and Performance\n- Analyzing UI Performance with Systrace\nAutomate UI performance tests\nOne approach to UI Performance testing is to simply have a human tester perform a set of user operations on the target app, and either visually look for jank, or spend an very large amount of time using a tool-driven approach to find it. But this manual approach is fraught with peril - human ability to perceive frame rate changes varies tremendously, and this is also time consuming, tedious, and error prone.\nA more efficient approach is to log and analyze key performance metrics from automated UI tests. Android 6.0 includes new logging capabilities which make it easy to determine the amount and severity of jank in your application’s animations, and that can be used to build a rigorous process to determine your current performance and track future performance objectives.\nTo learn more about performance tests on Android, see Automated Performance Testing Codelab. In this codelab, you’ll learn how to write and execute automated tests and review the results to understand how to improve your app performance."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"short"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"search_simple"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"conceptual_explanation"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"unlikely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:ce13f30b-afcc-47d8-8819-c9806a3caba6>","<urn:uuid:a6b42f34-289e-4ae0-b7d4-f68fdcf0caf0>"],"error":null}
{"question":"How did Alessandro Alessandroni first learn to play musical instruments?","answer":"Alessandro Alessandroni started learning music at age 11 in a barber shop in the province of Viterbo. The barber shop was a reference point in small countries where instruments like guitar and mandolin were available. He learned guitar with assistance from a friend, and quickly became proficient in multiple instruments including piano, accordion, sax, flute, mandolin and sitar.","context":["Goodbye to Alessandro Alessandroni, the western world's most famous ‘whistle’\nThe composer, conductor and arranger Alessandro Alessandroni died in Rome. He had just turned 92 years-old. Celebrated for his 'whistle' which made many great soundtracks of the spaghetti western genre. 'For a Few Dollars More' is its 'booed' most iconic.\nLa Repubblica ·\nBy Valeria Rusconi and Ernesto Assante\nMarch 27, 2017\n\"It's very simple. I phoned Ennio Morricone and he told me: 'Sandro, come down here for a moment, in the room, we need you to whistle. Well, it was really a whistle, nothing more, but think about what happened next ... When we saw the film, I have to admit that no one thought it would make a penny\". And instead. Instead the 'whistling' really did change everything. Alessandro Alessandroni, the master - it is right to call him that - says the opening words of the most famous of his career and the most iconic of Western movies song that for a Fistful of Dollars, made up by Morricone, which made the film music of Sergio Leone - and practically made all the best western movies - even bigger. \"It was a great professional partnership, we had a wonderful collaboration,\" he told La Repubblica. Morricone, \"knew very well I could play the guitar and was the director of the choir and this was superb. And he knew very well that I could whistle. He had worked on A Fistful of Dollars and on other occasions. Why I chose him to whistle? by chance, I needed a whistle, I asked the musicians working with me who was able to whistle well and others I liked less. He had the courage to try\".\nThe composer, conductor and arranger Alessandro Alessandroni died in Rome, in the city that gave him birth on March 18, 1925, on March 26th. He had just turned 92 years of age. The announcement came on the official Facebook page of the composer: \"It is with great sorrow that I inform you of the death yesterday of the master Alessandro Alessandroni born in Rome on March 18, 1925, composer, multi-instrumentalist, arranger and choir director. There will be a memorial service at his home in Namibia with music and musicians directed by his son Alex Jr. Alessandroni\".\nAlessandroni approached music when he was still a boy. At the time he lived in the country of his mother, in the province of Viterbo. He was 11 years old and listened insistently, whenever he could to classical music. He began playing the guitar with assistance from a friend. The place is one of those details. He told in an interview to the blog Planet Hexacord: \"I started in the barber shop, because in small countries it is a reference point: there were the instruments, the guitar, the mandolin. They worked a little, but it sounded a lot. .. \". While he was attending the last year of high school he formed his first band, with whom he performed for local dance halls. Quick to learn, in a short time he become proficient on several instruments, which he alternates during his performances: as a teenager he already is able to play the guitar, the piano, the accordion, sax, flute, mandolin and sitar, one of the first Italians to try their hand on this complex stringed instrument. He obtained his diploma at the Conservatory in Rome, and found a job in the film production company Fonolux There he meets the great Nino Rota, his senior by 14 years, who wants him in his orchestra. Then came the whistle. It was almost by accident. Alessandroni, at some point, when Rota asked for a volunteer to whistle. Whistling become his new tool to play with and one of the moments that characterized the soundtracks of the Spaghetti Westerns. Music in effect: \"My whistle parts are on the staff,\" explained Alessandroni, \"and woe to miss the pitch, to make mistakes.\" That thought also by Federico Fellini, author of his soprannonme: Alessandroni for him was simply \"The Whistler\".\nIn 1962 he founded the octet I Cantori Moderni, a formation that takes the place of his previous group, the Caravels Quartet. With him, the band is formed by soprano Edda Dell'Orso, Augustus Garden, Franco Cossacks, Nino Dei, Enzo Gioieni, Gianna Spagnuolo and, not the least, his wife Julia De Mutiis.\nThe most important co-operation, long-lived and linked by a sincere esteem Alessandroni remains to this day one with Ennio Morricone: besides the famous whistle of For a Fistful of Dollars he also worked on For a Few Dollars More and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Alessandroni was used by all the most important Italian composers of the time, in the 1960s, such as Piero Umiliani, for which he sang along with his wife Giulia in great song Mah-na Mah-na, extracted from the soundtrack of Svezia inferno e paradiso by Louis Scattini (1968) and the master Armando Trovajoli. With the arrival of the seventies, for ARC of the RCA label which was dedicated to the ‘young Italian music’, between beats and 'world exotico', a public-disc collection of twelve songs in the race to the edition of 1969 of Canzonissima. Are recorded, of course, the tune and work on the Hammond organ solo is credited to Ron Alexander, his pseudonym.\nThe name of Alessandroni had become one of worship across the board, and had crossed generations and musical styles, especially he had conquered the library music enthusiasts. Among the last to want in their drive Baustelle, group of Montepulciano, who have chosen it for one of their best albums. \"Alessandro Alessandroni is the oldest guest,\" explained Francesco Bianconi, the singer, \"a wonderful eighty-four and played the sitar, accordion, acoustic guitar and he did blow the whistle\". The song title, not surprisingly, was Spaghetti Western.

{"question":"How did professional publications in the circus world compare to Etienne Dinet's career transitions in terms of institutional support?","answer":"Circus publications were typically supported by official organizations and professional structures, with magazines like 'Circus and Stage' being published by state structures and 'Scènes et Pistes' serving as a corporate publication. In contrast, Dinet's career showed more independent development - while he initially received official support through a bursary in 1885, he later chose to maintain his independence by declining to join the Villa Abd El Tif (an official training institution for French Orientalist painters) in 1907, preferring to keep his independent life in southern Algeria.","context":["The circus press\nby Pascal Jacob\nThe 20th century saw the emergence of an unexpected publishing phenomenon implicitly linked to the founding of amateur associations based on the model of fan clubs in the English-speaking world. These groups of enthusiasts – accustomed to meeting around the ring to watch a show, but also to gathering and exchanging opinions and information – were the ideal breeding ground for the creation of newsletters, reviews and magazines distributed in a small number of copies and often summarily printed.\nThe great ancestor of these groups, connecting members of the same community but with a decidedly official nature, was the Soviet magazine Circus and Stage – Цирк и Эстрада. Published by a state structure, it was aimed at linking both all those who worked for the central organisation of the Soviet State Circus and, more broadly, all those sensitive to the development of circus arts around the world. Circus and Stage took an interest in music hall and variety, as well as magic and, of course, the arts of the ring. The themes tackled were highly varied and offer a fascinating overview to help understand the evolution of the circus over time and throughout history. Circus and Stage was published for several decades and the illustrated covers of the various issues underwent regular graphic changes until the use of photography. These small, summarily bound booklets are part of a long line of highly specialised publications, accessible only by subscription.\nScènes et Pistes (1954-1987), a magazine with a corporate flavour, combined chronicles, classified ads and advertising inserts to offer its readers a real inter-professional link. The author, Paul Adrian, provided a great many articles and countless anecdotes about the world of the circus, thus contributing to the fame of the magazine, just as he did by writing for the German magazine Organ Show Business. These publications were similar to the monthly Circus Zeitung, the review In Cammino, published by the Vatican services, Circo, published by the Ente Nazionale Circhi, and L’Interforain, a corporate body highly focused on the world of fairs and festivals, which regularly granted space in its columns to the circus arts.\nAs a counterpoint to these “tools” intended primarily for the professional sector, amateur clubs and associations strengthened links between their members, sometimes distant from one another, through bulletins of varying regularity that were a combination of looking back at the past and topical stories. Scholarly publications, Les Cahiers du Cirque produced between 1957 and 1959 by the historian Tristan Rémy, were published in limited print runs: produced individually, with vignettes glued in, they were simply mimeographed and stapled together. These Cahiers were intended for a small number of insiders, keen to enrich their libraries and discover research themes tackled rarely, if at all. The volume dedicated to 40 ex libris of artists, authors or collectors is a veritable mine of original information in this respect.\nAimed at a broader audience, magazines such as King Pole, Bandwagon, White Tops and Le Cirque dans l’Univers published by the journalist Henry Thétard in England, the United States and France respectively from the late 1940s, focused primarily on feature articles and echoes, news and rumours about a form of entertainment that had now become universal.. These “historical” publications would be followed by a handful of others with sometimes very different tones. The beautiful review IMaginifico, published by the Italian publisher Giancarlo Pretini, gave pride of place to illustrations and historical texts, while Planet Circus asserted itself more as an overview of current productions. Cirque, created by the Swiss publisher Frédéric Bollmann Cirkulära Notiser, Manege, De Piste ou Bretagne Circus were, with varying degrees of efficiency, links between the members of the Swedish, Swiss, Dutch and French associations that published them. These magazines, mostly quarterly, tended more to reflect the states of a rather traditional form of the circus, whose developments they supported and commented on.\nLong considered a whole and indivisible entity, the circus became widely divided in the early 1970s and new reviews came into existence to accompany and comment on these aesthetic changes. Spectacle, ffounded in the United by Ernest Albrecht, Culture Clown, published since 2000 by the Centre de Recherche sur le Clown Contemporain, Juggle, published between 1988 and 2011, Kaskade, published until 2013, CIRQ en Capitale, published by the Espace Catastrophe in Brussels, Circus Magazine published by Circuscentrum also in Belgium, El Ambidextro and Juggling, two Iberian magazines with a focus on juggling, and Zirkolika, take an interest in all forms of the circus in Europe and around the world. Most current magazines dedicated to the contemporary circus are gathered under the umbrella of the virtual platform INCAM, International Network of Circus Arts Magazines.\nThe two issues of the magazine Les Saisons du Cirque, the short-lived Parade, large format on beautiful paper published by the French community in Belgium, the remarkable institutional review Arts de la Piste, published between 1995 and 2005 by the para-ministerial association Hors Les Murs, and the Le Magazine du Cirque et de l’Illusion, which folded after a few years of publication, clearly attest to a regular desire to report on a world that is constantly changing, even if virtual media such as Sideshow and Circus Now, currently have more reason to exist due to their flexibility of use and ability to be easily updated.","Name: Etienne Dinet Born: Paris, France 28 March, 1861 Died: Paris, France 24 December, 1929\nEtienne Dinet spent almost 50 years living in sourthern Algeria and he holds a very special position in the history of Orientalist painting. His empathy and understanding of the Algerians lend his works an authenticity rarely surpassed, each being infused with his unique talent and intensity of emotion.\nDuring the first half of the 19th century, French touring painters (voyageurs) were normally attached to military, scientific or diplomatic missions, but by 1870 the Orientalists tended to prefer to travel alone, although nevertheless depending heavily upon official sponsorship and commissions. Dinet on the other hand quickly gained public acclaim for his talent alone, rapidly developing his own unique plein air style.\nThe following is a brief chronology of his life and artistic career:\n|1861||Born in Paris into a prosperous middle-class family, his father being the president of the Seine civil court, his mother a devotee of the fine arts and whose influence could already be seen in his enthusiasm for drawing from the age of five.|\n|1865||Birth of his sister Jeanne, later to become his biographer.|\n|1871||Enters the Lycée Henri IV in Paris as a border. Shows interest in history, geography and drawing, and winning a first prize in the latter. His favourite times at this age are declared to be the holidays spent at his family mansion at Héricy, near Fontainebleau.|\n|1879||Having achieved his baccalaureat, Dinet begins his military service in Granville, Normandy, where his free time is employed in drawing and painting.|\n|Finishing military service, he must now choose a career. His father wants him to pursue the family tradition of law, however his interest in art pervades and he enters the Ecole des Beaux-Arts and the Galland atelier. His studies also include anatomy. However on the closure of this atelier, he enrols at the Académie Julian where his teachers include William Bouguereau and Tony Robert Fleury. He studies there for four years forging many enduring friendships.|\nHis first painting sent to the Paris Salon des Artistes Français, La Mère Clotilde, receives critical acclaim.\nThe brother of his friend Lucien Simon is an entomologist and about to embark on a scientific study visit to Algeria. The two friends decide to accompany him for the period of a month – to the south of the country - and thus begins his lifelong love for Algeria.\n|1885||He obtains a bursary and is able to visit Normandy, Brittany, Jersey and Switzerland to study landscape painting. Then in the spring he makes his second voyage to Algeria where he travels extensively, filling his sketchbook which exhibits his interest in precision of form and physiological detail. In this year he completes his first two Algerian works: Les Terrasses de Laghouat (The Terraces of Laghouat) and L’Oued M’sila après l’Orage (Wadi M’sila after the Storm).|\nLeaving the Académie Julian, he sets up in his own atelier in Rue de Rome, Paris.\nThe third voyage to Algeria, this time accompanied by a group of other young artists. Dinet, along with 13 other artists, including Paul Leroy and baron Arthur Chassériau, form the Société des Peintres Orientalistes Français (Society of French Orientalist Painters), with Jean-Léon Gérôme and Benjamin-Constant as honorary presidents, under the presidence of Léonce Bénédite, Conservator of the Musée du Luxembourg.\nDinet moves to a new atelier at 85 rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs, close to that of his friend Paul Leroy and with whom he enrols at the Oriental Language School to learn Arabic. In the same year he exhibits at the Galerie Georges Petit where his paintings hang beside those of Sisley and other Impressionists. For a fourth time he returns to Algeria, this time with the young guide Slimane Ben Ibrahim Baâmeur, who was to accompany him thenceforth for many years. Returning to Paris, his works again meet with acclaim.\n|1889||During this period he involves himself deeper in Orientalist themes and his canvas exhibited at the Salon, Midi en jouillet à Bou-Saâda, dazzles with it’s representation of light and heat. Again he moves to a new atelier, in the rue Furstemberg – close to where Delacroix worked – and his work is displayed in the Algerian Pavillion at the Universal Exhibition. Following this – together with a number of other ‘dissidents’, including Puvis de Chavannes, Carolus Duran, Charles Cottet and Auguste Rodin – he helps constitute the breakaway Société Nationale des Beaux-Arts.|\n|1893||The Palais de l’Industrie is the venue for the first official exhibition of the Peintres Orientalistes Français. He is also very enthusiastic about visiting an exhibition of Muslim art for the first time. From this time onwards he dedicates himself to paintings of an Algerian theme.|\n|1895||Dissatisfied with the results obtained creating paintings using oil colours and varnish, he experiments with a new technique using egg – as already employed by the “Primitives” – to give a clearer, brilliant tone.|\n|1898||Dinet publishes his first illustrated book – Le Poème d’Antar, translated from Arabic – with illustrations inspired by the Laghouat region. It comprised 120 illustrations and 12 decorative panels.|\n|1902||A second illustrated book is published – Rabia El Kouloub or Le Printemps des Coeurs (Springtime of the Hearts) – a collection of three Saharan legends, retold by Sliman with Dinet’s illustrations. His painting L’Arabe en prière (Arab Praying) initiates the process ultimately leading to his conversion to the Islamic faith in 1903.|\n|1903||Publishes in the journal “Art et Décoration” an article entitled Les Jeux de la lumière ou Observations sur l’exposition des Arts Musulmans (The Play of Light or Observations on the Islamic art exhibition),to be re-published alone at a later date.|\n|1904||Since he continues to spend several months of each year in Algeria, Dinet creates a permanent base there, buying a house at Bou-Saâda.|\n|1907||The Villa Abd El Tif is established in Algiers, along the lines of the Villa Médicis in Rome, as a place of training young French Orientalist painters, but Dinet prefers to keep his independence and his life in the south of the country.|\n|1909-1911||Two further books are published together with Silmane – works exalting the nomadic life – the second, Le Désert, receiving much acclaim. The location of his Paris atelier changes to Rue de l’Abbaye in the Saint-Germain-des-Près quarter, where it remains for several years. He begins thinking about writing a “Life of Mohammed” – since his fluency in the Arabic language now enabled him to research the ancient texts.|\n|1913||Dinet officially converts to Islam – and takes the name Nacer Ad Dine (Defender of the Faith). Although contemplated for a long time, this definitive act loses him several of his old friends, including Paul Leroy.|\n|1914||On 9th March his father dies and he is very much affected. With the beginning of the war, he returns to Héricy and, with the aid of his sister, transforms the mansion into a military hospital.|\n|1915-1918||Dinet becomes more politically involved in Algeria, taking up stances critical of the colonial administration, thereby again attracting much criticism. However he does succeed in obtaining better conditions for Islamic fighters in the war effort and helps in establishing a franco-islamic hospital at Poincaré. In Algeria he signs up with the franco-islamic north Africa action committee presided over by Edouard Herriot. Finally he publishes his “Life of Mohammed”, dedicated to the muslims who had given their lives for France.|\n|1922||In January his mother dies and, together with his sister, decides to sell the mansion at Héricy. With his share of the inheritance he buys a villa in Saint-Eugène, a suburb of Algiers.|\n|1925||The series of deaths continues with that of Léonce Bénédite and also Slimane’s mother. He sets about building a mausoleum by the Bou-Saâda wadi so that he can later be interred there together with Slimane and his wife when their time came.|\n|1926||In July he is present at the official opening of the Paris mosque, having been an enthusiastic proponent for the project from the outset. But for Dinet, the most successful event of the year was undoubtedly the publication of his illustrated edition of Khadra, danseuse Ouled Naïl, which was such a success that the printer was unable to satisfy the demand for copies.|\n|1928||Fattoum, the wife of Slimane, dies and is interred in the Mausoleum at Bou-Saâda. Dinet exhibits at the Paris Salin for the last time.|\n|1929||1 April||Dinet prepares to set out on his pilgrimage to Mecca.|\n|20 June||Returns to Marseille.|\n|6 July||For the first time he signs his paintings El Hadj Nasr Eddine.|\n|9 November||Finishes his book “Pilgrimage to the House of the Holy Allah”.|\n|22 November||Admitted to a clinic in Paris.|\n|24 December||Visited by the Governor General, Violette. At the age of 68, suffering from heart failure, Dinet dies. In January 1930, his body is transferred to Algiers to be interred in the mausoleum.|\nReference: “La Vie et l’Oeuvre de Etienne Dinet”, Denise Brahimi & Koudir Benchikou, ACR Edition, Paris 1991"],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"comparison"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"content_constrained"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"structured_comparison"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"moderate_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"formal_transactional"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:18bb07fa-f0ed-4e99-a087-73fcd089e152>","<urn:uuid:3a863aed-0bba-49af-a5f7-f573834c4da9>"],"error":null}
{"question":"What role does training play in quality monitoring implementation, and how does it relate to behavioral assessment competency?","answer":"Training plays a crucial role in quality monitoring implementation by enabling the design of improvement programs based on common deficiencies, supplementing programs with best and worst examples, and implementing mentoring and career pathing initiatives. Research indicates that even certified professionals often require additional training to achieve competency - studies of Board Certified Behavior Analysts showed inadequate baseline skill levels prior to intervention, but significant improvement after 4-8 training sessions. Quality monitoring helps accelerate skill development and retain good agents while improving existing capabilities through systematic assessment and feedback.","context":["|Toward Competent and Practical Functional Behavior Assessment of Severe Problem Behavior|\n|Monday, May 28, 2012|\n|2:00 PM–3:20 PM |\n|Area: PRA/TBA; Domain: Applied Research|\n|Chair: Jessica Woods (Melmark, Inc.)|\n|Discussant: Gregory P. Hanley (Western New England University)|\n|CE Instructor: James Chok, Ph.D.|\nThe use of functional behavior assessments is mandated in special education settings. The development of functional behavior assessments, including the functional analysis methodology outlined by Iwata et al. (1982/1984), has provided behavior analysts with valuable tools for managing severe problem behavior. Functional behavior assessments allow clinicians to accurately identify the function(s) of problem behavior, and subsequently, identify treatments that map onto the identified function(s). Although functional behavior assessments are essential to developing effective interventions, little is known about how skilled behavior analysts and related professionals are at conducting them. The current symposium will explore the functional analytic skill level of recently credentialed Board Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBAs) working within a private school setting. Next, the skills of related professionals will be explored within the context of state-wide training program designed to establish competency of functional behavior assessment skills. In addition, methodologies for the practical and efficient delivery of functional analytic services will be discussed, including a comparison of trial-based functional analysis methods and traditional functional analysis methodology across analogue and natural environments.\nFunctional Analysis Skills Training for Recently Credentialed Board Certified Behavior Analysts\n|JAMES T. CHOK (Melmark New England), Andrew Shlesinger (Melmark New England), Lisa A. Studer (Melmark New England), Frank L. Bird (Melmark New England)|\nThe current project examined the functional analysis (FA) skills of newly credentialed Board Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBAs) prior to, and following, formal training. Skills examined included appropriately carrying out the functional analysis conditions outlined by Iwata et al. (1982/1994), interpreting multielement FA graphs using the methodology outlined by Hagopian et al. (1997), determining next steps when FA data is undifferentiated, and selecting function-based interventions once FA data is conclusive. The performance of three participants was examined within a multiple baseline design across subjects. Although performance varied, baseline skill level was inadequate prior to intervention across subjects and skill areas. Skill acquisition was attained for all subjects within four to eight training sessions, the acquired skills were demonstrated effectively during generalization trials, and skills were largely maintained during a 3 month follow-up. The findings suggest that individuals who are board certified in behavior analysis may require additional training prior to conducting functional analyses.\nDeveloping Capacity for FBAs and Behavior Intervention Plans through a State-Wide Training Program\n|SEAN D.

Lee (University of Iowa), Jennifer Kuhle (University of Iowa)|\nThe use of Function-based assessments (FBAs) are mandated in special education who exhibit challenging behavior. The purpose of this project was to assess state challenging behavior specialist (CBS) consultant's specific skills whose job descriptions included the provision of FBAs for the development of appropriate Behavior Intervention Plans (BIP). Preliminary data indicated that the consultants self-reported low levels of skill and high needs of training in FBA and BIP development. A training program to teach these skills was evaluated that utilized: hands-on training with experience professionals in FBA and BIP, and a coursework sequence. Dependent variables included: (a) self-assessment ratings, (b) scores on a knowledge examination, (c), direct observations of the consultants implementing FBA's, and (d) scores of sophistication of FBA and accuracy of BIP match to FBA results. Group data from the participating CBS consultants will be evaluated using pre- and post-time series data. The results demonstrate that training produced improvements in CBS consultant's skills of FBA implementation and BIP development. The outcomes of this project illustrate two major findings: (a) that consultants are often insufficiently trained in FBA technologies, and (b) that the training model implemented significantly improved state consultant skills. Discussion of how the project impacts the state's ability to improve services for children with challenging behavior will also be discussed.\n|Trial-Based Functional Analysis: Changes of Methodology and Data Analysis|\n|TRACI LANNER (Springbrook), Brandon Scott Nichols (School at Springbrook), Sean Field (Western Michigan University), Michele D. Brock (Crossroads School for Children), Cheryl J. Davis (Crossroads School for Children), Thomas L. Zane (Endicott College)|\n|Abstract: The traditional functional analysis methodology has provided a highly predictive way of determining the function of targeted maladaptive behaviors, allowing for more effective treatments to be implemented. Over the past several years, researchers have been studying different permutations of functional analysis methodology and testing different assessment protocols. Trial-based functional analysis is one such evolution, which involves 2-minute duration sessions, with fewer occurrences of the target behavior necessary to determine function. We will present data on several participants who engaged in various problem behaviors, on which we conducted both traditional and trial-based functional analyses. The purpose was to determine the degree of correspondence between the two methodologies. For most participants, the same function was identified regardless of the functional analysis method. These findings suggest that practitioners could conduct trial-based functional analyses in either the analog or natural setting and be confident in identifying the maintaining variables of the target behavior.|","Live MonitoringQuality monitoring or call monitoring refers to the process of listening to or observing an agent’s phone calls or other multi-media contacts with customers in order to assess and evaluate strengths and weaknesses in performance. There are five (5) basic levels of quality monitoring:\n- Walk-Around Observation\n- Plug-in/doublejack monitoring\n- Silent Monitoring\n- Record and Review\nCompanies cite many different benefits from quality monitoring programs. Research results show that the majority of companies perform quality monitoring with one major goal in mind: to evaluate agent performance and improve service quality. Other reasons for quality monitoring include:\n- Assessment and improvement of scripts and processes\n- Greater customer satisfaction\n- Increased efficiency\n- Improved training programs\n- Uncovering common customer complaints and concerns\n- General troubleshooting\nMajor Benefits of Quality MonitoringAs a supervisor or manager, there are several key benefits you are trying to address when implementing a quality monitoring program. The four major benefits of quality monitoring directly impact:\n- Efficiency and cost\n- Customer satisfaction\n- Training improvements\nCustomer satisfactionQuality monitoring is one of the most effective methods for improving customer satisfaction levels. Many supervisors and managers look for correlation between customer service levels and quality monitoring scores. When performing quality monitoring, you will:\n- Improve overall employee performance.\n- Gain valuable customer feedback.\n- Increase customer satisfaction by addressing common complaints and evaluating customer needs.\n- Assess agents’ listening and comprehension skills.\n- Evaluate agents’ problem-solving abilities.\n- Gain insight as to how well agents are controlling the pace and flow of the conversation.\n- Assess agents’ customer relationship management skills.\nEfficiency and costOverall call center efficiency is improved with the implementation of a quality monitoring system. In the end, higher levels of efficiency result in lower costs. Quality monitoring allows managers and supervisors to:\n- Reduce defective calls that result in callbacks.\n- Reduce handle time by improving system navigation skills.\n- Troubleshoot problem areas.\n- Review scripting for improvement.\n- Identify weaknesses in systems operation and navigation.\n- Improve employee procedures.\nTraining improvementsThe benefit of quality monitoring that is most often overlooked by supervisors is the improvement of training and new agent orientation programs. Quality monitoring sessions, when recorded and archived, can be especially beneficial during new agent orientation and training. The ability to illustrate with live examples is a major benefit that is often overlooked.\n- Design improvement programs based on common deficiencies in agents, scripts or policies.\n- Improve training programs by supplementing them with the “best of” and “worst of” quality monitoring examples.\n- Implement mentoring, career pathing and in-house training programs using quality monitoring as an aid.\n- Retain good agents and improve upon existing skills.\nQualityOverall call center quality performance is improved with the implementation of quality monitoring systems.\n- Benchmarking studies indicate a correlation between quality monitoring implementation and overall call center performance improvement.\n- Helps companies maintain quality standard.\n- Increases cost effectiveness through improved efficiencies.\n- Accelerates development of agent skills.\n- Creates visible accountability for performance."],"question_categories":[{"categorization_name":"answer_type","category_name":"multi-aspect"},{"categorization_name":"question_length","category_name":"moderate"},{"categorization_name":"question_formulation","category_name":"natural_synthesis"},{"categorization_name":"premise_categorization","category_name":"without premise"}],"user_categories":[{"categorization_name":"user_preferred_response_style","category_name":"practical_steps"},{"categorization_name":"user_follow_up_likelihood","category_name":"likely_follow_up"},{"categorization_name":"user_conversational_style","category_name":"polite_conversational"}],"document_ids":["<urn:uuid:65eed8f2-9a81-4931-9def-f740bbcc7512>","<urn:uuid:c3d9d13a-b166-4cf9-8d3d-21f47dd02459>"],"error":null}
