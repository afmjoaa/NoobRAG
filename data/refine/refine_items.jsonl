{"id": 6, "question": "What is RF value in chromatography and how is it measured?", "passages": [{"passage": "Chromatography is a separation technique used in various industries, including pharmaceuticals, biotechnology, food, and environment. It involves two stages: stationary and mobile phases. The stationary phase is a solid or liquid adsorbent, while the mobile phase is a solvent or gas that moves through the stationary phase.\n\nIn Chromatography, less polar compounds elute first due to their lower adsorption in the polar stationary phase. In Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC), a plate is coated with a solid adsorbent, and a small drop of the mixture is placed near the bottom. The solvent mobile phase gradually rises, separating the compounds based on their polarity, expressed by the Retention Factor (RF) value.\n\nIn TLC, the stationary phase is water adsorbed in newspaper, and the mobile phase is a combination of organic solvents and water. In Gas Chromatography (GC), a column is coated with different stationary phases, and the sample is vaporized without decomposition and transferred through the column by inert carrier gases like He or nitrogen. Each compound elutes at a different time, known as the retention time.\n\nThe Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) is a measure of the desired signal strength compared to the unwanted noise. To calculate SNR, subtract the noise value from the signal strength value.\n\nIn Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), the acquisition time is the time necessary to record a signal. The noise figure is calculated by subtracting one from another if the signal to noise ratios are expressed in decibels.\n\nIn radiology, the SNR is a measure of the true signal, and a lower SNR results in a grainy appearance to images. The frequency in NMR is given by f = gB, g = 2Î¼z/h.\n\nTitration and spectrophotometric measurements are quantitative analytical procedures used for the analysis of various compounds. Beer's and Lambert's laws are important to spectrophotometric measurements.\n\nSpectrophotometric measurements are used for the determination of the content of phenolic compounds in various samples. The advantages and disadvantages of using spectrophotometric measurements include their sensitivity, specificity, and the need for calibration standards.\n\nIn GC-FPD analysis, the sample is vaporized without decomposition, transferred through a column coated with a stationary phase, and detected by a flame photometric detector. The mobile phase and column vary depending on the sample being analyzed.\n\nThe detection sensitivity of an instrument like HPLC or GC can be determined by injecting a known amount of a standard and measuring the response. The limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantitation (LOQ) are determined by analyzing the signal-to-noise ratio.\n\nIn Arthritis and Rheumatism, a negative Rheumatoid Factor (RF) indicates that the RF level is within normal limits (less than 20 IUs per ml). The SpectraCell Analysis Test measures the function of a range of vitamins, minerals, antioxidants, and other micronutrients in blood cells. The SpectraCell Analysis Test is important because nutrient status is a very important component of health.\n\nIn Thin Layer Chromatography (TLC), the sample is applied to a plate, and the solvent is allowed to fully evaporate. The plate is then placed in a beaker with the solvent level below a pencil line. The solvent rises up the plate, separating the compounds based on their polarity, and the Rf values or the Retention Factors are then compared for analysis. The Rf value is calculated as the ratio of the distance traveled by a compound to the distance traveled by the solvent.", "score": 8.857783257961273, "source": "basic", "doc_IDs": ["<urn:uuid:d3519a5a-f4d4-49a1-822e-a8acbbe2465f>", "<urn:uuid:0ab3e1f8-9dba-4b3b-b8ad-8802bd033007>", "<urn:uuid:6ac35a60-defd-4607-815c-766a53003c71>", "<urn:uuid:2f599034-fd86-49b6-990f-924714ddfef0>", "<urn:uuid:049ebe34-16b9-4ced-81ff-37417202dde5>", "<urn:uuid:f2b45707-1fa9-4144-abec-7ea22e4981b3>", "<urn:uuid:92687440-2a17-4e52-b3df-fe812eabb1fe>", "<urn:uuid:d867e791-8364-44b5-a4aa-49fe0665e74c>", "<urn:uuid:f8ae779b-88cc-4b22-a43f-d8698c875abc>", "<urn:uuid:bbcece3d-0267-4c90-9fd9-da4bc53e471f>", "<urn:uuid:3aa33a15-c055-4536-a44b-e2d772fc2c1a>", "<urn:uuid:f593e84b-22f3-4a0f-892b-81cbb9d31301>", "<urn:uuid:3cf752f7-c1b3-4e20-b7be-ef023f9b0854>", "<urn:uuid:404012af-eab9-46bd-98ff-15387d59e3b2>", "<urn:uuid:2b9149e3-d871-4b69-9809-30f6255bfca6>", "<urn:uuid:82c0ce91-d994-40e8-a04b-b3494f7d737b>", "<urn:uuid:ea111c29-241a-4d14-acff-afba77313364>", "<urn:uuid:7276b051-094f-4011-bba1-682b1b2f4225>", "<urn:uuid:40340dde-95dc-4993-bb6d-a295dc673b49>"]}, {"passage": "Key Facts:\n1.

In addition, the retardation factor can vary greatly with the content of moisture in the adsorbent. The Rf values or the Retention Factors are then compared for analysis. This Rf value can be quantified as such:\nRf = (Distance that compound has traveled)/ (distance that the solvent has traveled)\nA light pencil line is drawn approximately 7 mm from the bottom of the plate and a small drop of a solution of the dye mixture is placed along the line. To show the original position of the drop, the line must be drawn in pencil. If it was drawn in ink, dyes from the ink would move up the TLC plate along with the dye mixture and the results would not be accurate. In order to get more accurate results, dot the TLC paper with the dye mixture a few times trying to build up material without widening the spots. A spot with a diameter of 1 mm will give good results. While dotting the TLC plate, be sure to not dot mixtures too close to one another because when the dye mixture rises up the TLC plate, it will clash with the other spots and the Rf values will be difficult to calculate.\nWhen the spots are dry, the TLC plate is placed in a beaker, with the solvent level below the pencil line. Cover the beaker to ensure that the atmosphere in the beaker is saturated with solvent vapor. Line the beaker with some filter paper soaked in solvent because this will help in the process of separating the mixture. Saturating the atmosphere in the beaker with solvent vapor stops the solvent from evaporating as it rises up the plate.\nAs the solvent slowly travels up the plate, the different components of the dye mixture travel at different rates and the mixture is separated into different colored spots. The solvent is allowed to rise until it approximately 1-1.5 cm from the top of the plate. This gives the maximum separation of the dye components for this particular combination of solvent and stationary phase.\nOnce the maximum separation of the dye components for this particular solvent and stationary phase solvent is induced, the TLC plate is removed from the beaker and allowed to dry.

A plant extract was then applied, in repeated strokes, across the pencil line. Between each stroke time was allowed for the plant extract to dryâthis process was enhanced by blowing on the paper after each application. The application of the plant extract was stopped when an ample amount had accumulated, forming a thin stripe. An acetone solution was placed within a test tube, but the amount of acetone used depended on the length of the chromatography paper because only the tip of the paper was positioned in the solution. The chromatography paper was attached to a paper clip and fastened to a cork that was stuck in the opening of the test tube.\nBetween eight and ten minutes was then allowed for the acetone solution to travel up the length of the chromatography paper. After this allotted time the paper was removed from the test tube and the furthest distance that the solvent traveled was marked with a pencil, and the distance it traveled was measured and recorded in Table 1. Then, using a completed chromatogram the locations of the various pigments were found, and thus the different pigments were identified.

The solvent is allowed to fully evaporate off, or else a very poor or no separation will be accomplished. The plate must be dried in a vacuum chamber particularly if a non-volatile solvent was employed to apply the sample.\nA small amount of a suitable solvent is poured to an appropriate transparent container to a depth of less than 1 centimeter. The strip of filter paper is placed to the chamber, in such a way that its bottom touches the solvent, and the paper lies on the chamber wall and reaches approximately to the top of the container. The container is closed by a cover glass or any other lid and is left for some minutes to let the solvent vapors ascend the filter paper and saturate the air in the chamber. The TLC plate is then put in the chamber in such a way that the spots of the sample don't touch the surface of the solvent in the chamber, and the lid is closed. The solvent moves up the plate through capillary action, meets the sample mixture and carries it up the plate (that is, elutes the sample). Whenever the solvent front reaches no higher than the top of the filter paper in the chamber, the plate must be eliminated and dried.\n=> Separation Process:\nVarious compounds in the sample mixture travel at different rates because of the differences in their attraction to the stationary phase, and due to differences in solubility in the solvent. By changing the solvent, or possibly by using a mixture, the separation of components (that is, measured by the Rf value) can be adjusted. As well, the separation accomplished by a TLC plate can be employed to approximate the separation of a flash chromatography column.\nThe separation of compounds is mainly based on the competition of the solute and the mobile phase for binding places on the stationary phase. For illustration, if normal phase silica gel is employed as the stationary phase it can be considered polar. Given two compounds that vary in polarity, the more polar compound consists of a stronger interaction by the silica and is thus more capable to dispel the mobile phase from the binding places. As a result, the less polar compound moves higher up the plate (resultant in the higher Rf value).", "score": 0.0018231182689026626, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:2b9149e3-d871-4b69-9809-30f6255bfca6>", "text": "distribution of molecules between the paer and the solvent\n- if the chemical is more attracted to the mobile phase, moves faster, yet if more attracted to the stationary phase more slower\n- chemicals seperate\nWhat are the advantages and disadvantages to paper and thin layer chromatography(TLC)?\n- limited use\n-requires only small volumes of solutions\n-good pre- experiment test\nWhat are aqueous solutions and non-aqueous solutions?\n- -aqueous - solution in water\n- non-aqueous- solutions with no water\nWhat is the mobile and stationary phases TLC and is TLC down?\n- mobile phase-solvent\n-stationaryp hase- an absorbent\nsolid supported on a glass plate or stiff plastic sheet\n-sample dissolved in solvent\n-applied to stationary phase\n- allowed to dry then more solution is added if dilute\n- sample analysed\nWhat is a chromatogram?\n1.add substance to solvent\n2. put solvent in a chromatography tank and put a lid over it\n3. after a few minutes put a prepared paer( maked with a base line and spotted)or TLC\n- all over the paper, but only above the baseline\n4. solvent rises up the paer, leaving a sustance that can be analysed\nHow are colourless sustances located on paper or TLC?\n1. develop chromatogram by spraying it with a locating agent that rea ts with substances to form coloured compounds\n2.

You deal with similar compounds and you need to figure out what is in the mixture. Chromatography is one of the science methods and techniques used to address this issue. It can be used to separate liquid or soluble compounds which have very similar properties and can not be extracted or separated by other methods.\nTo understand how chromatography works imagine group of people of similar fitness. They should carry weights along the road starting at the same place. They all take off at the same time and walk with approximately the same speed. All weights have identical look but actually they made of different alloys.\nLet's say half of them are 20kg weight (~44 lb) and half - 40kg. Each person takes the weight and walks with it.\nPersons with heavier weights will need to take a rest more frequently and perhaps rest longer then those who carry lighter weights.\nPretty soon our carriers and our weights will be separated in two groups. Something similar happens during the chromatography process.\nIn our example people who carried the weights were what in chromatography called mobile phase. The roadside where they would take the rest was stationary phase. And weights were our chemical compounds. Bunch of different weights at the start line was analyte. And the weight and gravity force worked as affinity between chemical compound and stationary phase. We forget to tell that at the start there were more people then weights, so some lucky went off with empty hands. They would travel further then all others. This would be our solvent front.\nOne important term in chromatography that you need to understand is Retention Factor.\nRetention factor is a value that helps to identify same chemical compounds on different chromatograms. This problem may occur where we compare different samples on different chromatograms(for example plant pigments extracted from different species of plant). It's calculated as a simple ratio: Rf = D2/D1, where D1 is the distance our compound traveled from the start line and D2 is the distance of the solvent front from the start line. For the same compound running on the same stationary phase with same solvent this ratio will always be the same!\nConclusion?

Closed loop feedback control system 54 utilizes microprocessor 394 to serve as a controller, monitor the temperature, adjust the RF power, analyze the result, refeed the result, and then modulate the power.\nWith the use of sensor 346 and feedback control system 54, tissue adjacent to RF electrode 314 can be maintained at a desired temperature for a selected period of time without causing a shut down of the power circuit to electrode 314 due to the development of excessive electrical impedance at electrode 314 or adjacent tissue as is discussed herein. Each RF electrode 314 is connected to resource that generate an independent output. The output maintains a selected energy at RF electrode 314 for a selected length of time.\nCurrent delivered through RF electrode 314 is measured by current sensor 396. Voltage is measured by voltage sensor 398. Impedance and power are then calculated at power and impedance calculation device 400. These values can then be displayed at user interface and display 402. Signals representative of power and impedance values are received by a controller 404. A control signal 404â² (also called energy control signal 404â²) is generated by controller 404 that is proportional to the difference between an actual measured value, and a desired value. The control signal is used by power circuits 406 to adjust the power output an appropriate amount in order to maintain the desired power delivered at respective RF electrodes 314.\nIn a similar manner, temperatures detected at sensor 346 provide feedback for maintaining a selected power. Temperature at sensor 346 is used as a safety means to interrupt the delivery of power when maximum pre-set temperatures are exceeded. The actual temperatures are measured at temperature measurement device 408, and the temperatures are displayed at user interface and display 402.", "score": 5.367694869468628e-05, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:54f60966-a5e3-4d4f-8ef5-d96bfd906df1>", "text": "I would refer to the WB-62 design vehicle, which means a multi-unit tractor-trailer combination that has a 62 foot wheel base. This truck is actually about 69 feet from nose to tail. There are also the WB-40 and the WB-50 and the WB-65. For trivia purposes, the WB-65, which is 74 feet from nose to tail, is the vehicle used when designing interstaets and interstate ramp terminals.\nThe importance of the design vehicle becomes clear when you start putting together the design of intersections and sharp curves. Larger trucks need more room in order to make turns. The rear wheels of a truckâwell, of any vehicle, reallyâwill run to the inside of the front wheels. This wider path made during a turn is called overtracking, and its why you see large trucks swing out really wide when theyâre making right angle turns at intersections. The distance and width needed to ensure that the rear wheels of the design vehicle stay off the edge of pavement, or out of the adjacent lanes, can add a lot of cost to a design project.\nNext time youâre walking in an area that has curbs and you come to an intersection, look at the corners. Do you see tire tracks up against the curb faces? Do you see tire tracks on top of the curb, or on the sidewalk? Are the corners, maybe including the pedestrian ramps, broken and cracked? If any of these are true, it means most likely that truck drivers are running their rear wheels up and over the curbs when theyâre trying to make turns. This could be becuase the driver isnât very good, but more likely itâs because thereâs not enough room for the trucks to clear when taking their overtracking into account.\nLarge vehicles are also important to consider when weâre designing intersections and considering the time it takes to accelerate. For example, the distance you need to be able to see to your left, or to your right, when youâre trying to turn onto a roadway. On a 45 mile per hour road, with no other consideations, that distance should be 500 feet if youâre driving a car. If youâre driving a tractor trailer, then I have to add another 270 feet!

Accidents involving large trucks can be devastating simply due to the weight and size of commercial trucks. They can weigh up to 40 tons, compared to one to five tons for an average passenger vehicle. One of the most common types of trucking accidents involves wide right turns which are exceptionally dangerous because they can result in head on collisions. If you have been injured in a commercial trucking accident, you need to speak with an experienced personal injury attorney as soon as possible.\nWhy Wide Right Turn Accidents Occur\nIf you visualize how a truck has to make a right turn it is easier to understand how these accidents happen. The size of a truck makes it hard to maneuver a truck. To manage these turns, a truck must swing the truck to the left first. This can result in one of several types of right turn accidents. If the truck swings their vehicle to the left too far, it can veer into the next lane of traffic and strike the vehicles there.\nThe second type of wide right turn accident occurs if the truck driver doesnât go far enough to the left before attempting to turn right. The failure to swing sufficiently to the left can cause the truck to roll over. This can be devastating enough because it could cause cargo to spill onto other vehicles or the roadway or result in a fire. In even more devastating situations, the truck could roll over on top of nearby vehicles.\nThe third common type of wide right turn accident occurs where there are two right turning lanes. When a truck turns, it may veer into the second turn lane. If a car is in that lane, it may be trapped or crushed by the turning truck.\nAlthough a truck driver should always use a turn signal to indicate their intentions, many drivers fail to realize how much a berth a truck needs to make a right turn. This may result in them not giving the truck enough space.\nDetermining Liability in a Wide Right Turn Accident\nIf you have suffered injuries in a wide right turn accident, you may be entitled to receive compensation for your injuries and damages. However, who pays the compensation depends on who is liable for the accident.", "score": 0.85623318, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:e267e980-b9c6-4d03-bc9e-02e50478e3f9>", "text": "CNN explores a burning question: why do commercial delivery couriers always favour right hand turns? Apparently these services save âmillions of gallons of fuel each year, and avoids emissions equivalent to over 20,000 passenger cars.â with this one practice. By avoiding left turns, you are avoiding delays that can make for traffic build ups. Even a left turning phase adds approximately 45 seconds to a left turn.\nAnd there is more-âa study on crash factors in intersection-related accidents from the US National Highway Traffic Safety Association shows that turning left is one of the leading âcritical pre-crash eventsâ (an event that made a collision inevitable), occurring in 22.2 percent of crashes, as opposed to 1.2 percent for right turns. â Over 60 per cent of crashes happen while turning left, compared to 3 per cent of crashes involving right turns.\nInformation from data collected by New York Cityâs transportation planners conclude that pedestrians are three times more likely to be killed from left turn vehicles. The UPS carriers assess all the routes to avoid left hand turns to minimize idling time and increase time sensitivity. They have rebooted Google maps to reflect routes that minimize left hand turns, a practice developed in the 1970âs with the term âLoop Dispatchâ.\nWhile this works great for pre-planned routes, in daily driving routes are less random.

Share the following Safety Matters with your drivers.\nAvoiding Right Turn Squeeze Crashes\nLarge commercial vehicles can be challenging to maneuver, particularly on residential and city streets. Taking a turn too sharply or widely can lead to costly accidents and serious injuries. One common type of accident is the right turn squeeze crash, which occurs when a truck driver makes a wide right turn, leaving too much distance between the truck and the curb. When doing so, other drivers on the road may try to squeeze past the truck and could end up getting their vehicle caught underneath the truckâs trailer.\nIn order to make right turns as safe as possible, drivers should be aware of their environments and the potential challenges that they may impose. For example, a particularly narrow intersection can make right turns especially dangerous.\nIt is also important that the vehicles and trailers are in proper working order. A broken turn signal or a lack of adequate mirrors will make any type of driving unsafe.\nThere are many steps to making a turn. As a truck driver, you have a responsibility for not only your own safety, but that of pedestrians and other drivers as well. When making a right turn, adhere to the following steps in order to make the process as safe as possible:\n- Prepare for the turn by moving into the right-hand lane as early as you can.\n- Activate your turn signal well in advance, and reduce your speed.\n- As you approach the intersection, observe the area and make sure that you will be able to safely complete the turn.\n- When beginning your turn, keep the rear of your trailer in the right-hand lane and close to the curb.\n- Avoid swinging wide to the left or crossing into other lanes.\n- Use your mirrors to check for other vehicles, pedestrians or obstructions.\n- Never back up when completing a turn.\nIf you are unable to finish a turn, wait for other traffic to clear to do so.\nAs a driver, safety should be your top priority. If you find that a turn may not be possible, it is better to take a slight detour and ensure that you will be able to get to your destination safely. A small delay is far less costly than an accident. If you have any questions about making right turns safely, talk to your supervisor.", "score": 0.843693078, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:7f895c94-6ad2-4c9c-9a4a-bad6883b9908>", "text": "Truck drivers admittedly recognize that making a right turn with their long and heavy loads is not easy. Every experienced big rig driver will admit that negotiating a right turn can be downright dangerous and likely have many accounts they could tell demonstrating this.\nClearly, the size of the big rigs themselves require that the big rig operators understand the special techniques required to negotiate right hand turns and be even more vigilant for pedestrians and vehicles around them while they negotiate the turn.\nA common scenario leading to a collision between a big rig and an auto during a right hand turn is due to the âswinging rear.â As the truck makes its right turn, the rear of the trailer will swing in the opposite direction. In other words, to the left. This can cause a portion of the rear end of the truck end to up several inches (perhaps even feet) over into the adjoining lane. Should a car be there while the truck is âswingingâ over into the lane and comes into contact with another car, the force has at times caused these cars to be then pushed out of their lane and into the next adjoining lane resulting in the middle car getting crushed. The collisions are especially dangerous when the car that got hit by the rear of the big rig gets pushed in a lane involving traffic going in the opposite direction.\nThe size and length of many tractor trailers is an issue when negotiating the right turn which can be compounded if the street is not very wide. Oftentimes, truck drivers find themselves actually crossing the double lines of a two way street in order to get their big rig setup to complete the right hand turn. Therefore, many 18 wheeler tractor trailer collisions involve vehicles that were heading in the opposite direction of the big rig but were struck during the turn.\nPedestrians can also be crushed during a right hand turn scenario. At times, a pedestrian will pass while the big rig while it is negotiating the right hand turn. Many pedestrians, especially children, have nearly no experience walking near big rigs and may not take into consideration that the big rig will come swinging back. Other times, a big rig operator will simply end up crossing into the bike or pedestrian lanes taking the bicyclist or pedestrian by surprise. Sadly these accidents usually result in severe injury or death.\nWe at the Law Offices of Edward A. Smith respects those in the big rig community and the services they provide our nation.

The sheer size of the vehicles alone makes them a hazard on the road, and they are far more likely to cause accidents and injuries than cars, motorbikes, and cycles are. If youâre a truck driver, you need to make sure youâre doing all you can, all the time, to keep yourself and your fellow road users safe and to ensure you donât let accidents strip you of your trucking authority.\nBe aware of YOUR speed limits\nMore often than not, speed limit signs will dictate one maximum speed limit for smaller vehicles, and another one for larger ones. Your truck will fall under the larger-vehicle limit, which will be slower than the one imposed on cars, and it is of the utmost importance that you are aware of this. Do not confuse the limits, as doing so will see you go faster than you should be going with your type of vehicle, and will, therefore, make you more of a danger.\nYou should be particularly aware of your speed when you come to turns in the road. Trucks are far more likely to lose control of themselves as they curve than cars are, and their drivers MUST slow down when their road begins to deviate.\nPay attention to your space cushion\nYour space cushion is the room that immediately surrounds your truck on all of its sides, and other vehicles shouldnât be encroaching upon it. Of course, you cannot account for other drivers, and anybody could get too close to you at any time. What you can account for, however, is your own driving skills, and making sure your truck never gets too close to anything else that it shares the road with.\nImportantly, this means maintaining a safe distance between yourself and the vehicle in front of you.

The conquest started at Marsala, and native Sicilians joined him in the capture of the southern Italian peninsula. Garibaldi's march was finally completed with the Siege of Gaeta, where the final Bourbons were expelled and Garibaldi announced his dictatorship in the name of Victor Emmanuel II of Kingdom of Sardinia. Sicily became part of the Kingdom of Sardinia after a referendum where more than 75% of Sicily voted in favor of the annexation on 21 October 1860 (but not everyone was allowed to vote). As a result of the Kingdom of Italy proclamation, Sicily became part of the kingdom on 17 March 1861.\nAfter the Italian Unification, in spite of the strong investments made by the Kingdom of Italy in terms of modern infrastructure, the Sicilian (and the wider mezzogiorno) economy remained relatively underdeveloped and this caused an unprecedented wave of emigration. In 1894, organizations of workers and peasants known as the Fasci Siciliani, protested against the bad social and economic conditions of the island but they were suppressed in a few days. The Messina earthquake of 28 December 1908 killed over 80,000 people. This period was also characterised by the first contact between the Mafia, the Sicilian crime syndicate (also known as Cosa Nostra), and the Italian government.", "score": 0.810246289, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:eaa452e5-71f7-4343-9c24-705988bd3b2d>", "text": "There is much discussion even today about exactly how a relatively small band of Garibaldini, augmented at most by a few thousand irregulars picked up along the way, managed to make their way up the peninsula against what, at least on paper, appeared to be an overwhelmingly superior force. It is probably best to view Garibaldi's victory as resulting from a combination of factors. First, Garibaldi, himself, was a master of the hit-and-run harassing tactics that would one day become known as \"guerrilla warfare.\" He was also a firm believer in Napoleon's dictum that \"morale is to material as ten is to one\"âand his Redshirts had morale to burn. They were the righteous bringers of a new nation, and there is little doubt that large numbers of the long-suffering peasantry in Calabria and Puglia (perhaps less so as he moved further north towards Naples) genuinely viewed them as liberators.\nsituation in the Bourbon military also worked to\nGaribaldi's advantage. There was massive desertion among\nroyalist troops, many of whom felt that they were now\nbound up in defending a lost cause. Additionally, the\nofficer corps had been bitterly split for at least a\ndecade between old-guard royalists and those who felt\nthat the time for a united Italy had come at last.\nAll this, and more, combined to produce the unlikely sight, on September 7, 1860, of Giuseppe Garibaldi and a small group of companions entering Naples unopposed, by train (!) from Salerno and then in an open carriage from the station to the Royal Palace. They were miles ahead of the army. The king had fled to Gaeta the day before and the city and remaining troops welcomed the Risorgimento by giving Garibaldi a hero's welcome.\nA Bourbon force of about 20,000 troops had remained loyal to the king and gone north with him. Initially, the king had intended his retreat as somewhat of a strategic withdrawal. He had no intention of surrendering his kingdom without a fight.

Garibaldi, after all, in his youth had had to do with a mystic band of Christian communards, the St. Simonians, who, years before Karl Marx, had preached: From each according to his capacity; To each according to his works; The end of the exploitation of man by man; and The abolition of all privileges of birth.\nGaribaldi landed at\nMarsala and a few days later engaged a superior force\nnear Calatafimi.

Please bear with me, I'm a total layman and can't seem to get a definitive answer anywhere online. So I guess I get the basics: Matter is made up of atoms which are made up of subatomic particles. But the added mass of the individual particles doesn't add up to the total mass of the atom. The remaining mass is made up of energy. The energy that was needed to bind the particles into a nucleus is converted into mass when the strong force takes over from the EM force. Which means that matter is partly converted energy.... But what about the particles that make up the atom? Were the protons, electrons and neutrons matter before they became bound together? Or were these particles themselves energy to begin with? The reason I'm confused is because free electrons are supposed to be electrical energy, not matter. And, seeing as photons are free moving and they are energy, I'm assuming that subatomic particles are energy until they are bound into an atom, making them matter.....?

But electrons do. So do quarks and neutrinos. What is not known is: why? Why is it that some particles have mass and others do not? What controls the amount of mass a particle has? One hypothesis is that an elusive particle called the âHiggs bosonâ is responsible for giving all other particles their mass. Since the Higgs boson controls all other particles, it is sometimes referred to as the âGod particle.â\nSome reports have given people the impression that the LHC will confirm the big bangâ¦But this isnât so.Some reports have given people the impression that the LHC will confirm the big bang (the secular version of the origin of the universe). But this isnât so. The reason there is such confusion is that the LHC will simulate the conditions that secular scientists believe existed during the big bang. However, regardless of the outcome, the LHC will give us no reason whatsoever to believe that such conditions have ever actually existed. Just because something can be done today doesnât mean it has ever happened in nature in the past (i.e., we can put men in orbit around the earth today, but that never happened in nature before the 20th century.) Therefore, despite hyped media reporting, the LHC cannot (even in principle) demonstrate that the big bang happened. It may, however, give us some interesting insight into how God upholds His universe today.", "score": 0.03438451294421646, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:1a34a708-8d26-4c88-8be4-b8035e6c6874>", "text": "The Higgs. Whaaaa? July 6, 2012Posted by gordonwatts in ATLAS, CMS, Higgs, LHC, physics, press.\nOk. This post is for all my non-physics friends who have been asking meâ¦ What just happened? Why is everyone talking about this Higgs thing!?\nIt does what!?\nActually, two things. It gives fundamental particles mass. Not much help, eh? Fundamental particles are, well, fundamental â the most basic things in nature. We are made out of arms & legs and a few other bits. Arms & legs and everything else are made out of cells. Cells are made out of molecules. Molecules are made out of atoms. Note weâve not reached anything fundamental yet â we can keep peeling back the layers of the onion and peer inside. Inside the atom are electrons in a cloud around the nucleus. Yes! Weâve got a first fundamental particle: the electron! Everything weâve done up to now says it stops with the electron. There is nothing inside it. It is a fundamental particle.\nWe arenât done with the nucleus yet, however. Pop that open and youâll find protons and neutrons. Not even those guys are fundamental, however â inside each of them youâll find quarks â about 3 of them. Two âupâ quarks and a âdownâ quark in the case of the proton and one âupâ quark and two âdownâ quarks in the case of the neutron. Those quarks are fundamental particles.\nThe Higgs interacts with the electron and the quarks and gives them mass. You could say it âgeneratesâ the mass. Iâm tempted to say that without the Higgs those fundamental particles wouldnât have mass. So, there you have it. This is one of its roles. Without this Higgs, we would not understand at all how electrons and quarks have mass, and we wouldnât understand how to correctly calculate the mass of an atom!\nNow, any physicist who has made it this far is cringing with my last statement â as a quick reading of it implies that all the mass of an atom comes from the Higgs. It turns out that we know of several different ways that mass can be âgeneratedâ â and the Higgs is just one of them.", "score": 0.022208525748915124, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:0ae101af-88d3-42e3-a830-2c0cc43ff9bd>", "text": "Subway style Îv map:\nTotal Îv values\nÎv change values\nÎv with Phase Angles\nPrecise Total Îv values\nMaximum Îv Chart\n- This chart is a quick guide to what engine to use for a single stage interplanetary ship.

Clearly, with low fuel demand after the vehicle has been unused for a long time, the fuel pump can be inoperative for a relatively long time while the vapour pressure is reduced, and is restarted to meet a higher fuel demand from the engine.\nThus, it can be seen that the fuel pump of the invention can not only feed cryogenic vapour and liquid to the engine, but it can be used to prevent excessive pressure build-up in the vapour chamber of the vehicle tank, by pumping excess vapour into the surge tank 239 for use by the engine when required. Because vapour alone cannot meet full fuel demand from the engine, whenever the engine demands full fuel requirements, the surge tank pressure rapidly drops below the low set point causing the liquid control valve 230 to open to supply cryogenic liquid to the pump which immediately satisfies the engine demand. Most vehicles do not require full fuel demand for all operating conditions, e.g. when the engine is at idle when the vehicle is stopped, or when the vehicle is descending, with the engine essentially coasting. At these times, any excess pressure of vapour in the fuel tank can be delivered to the surge tank, so as to reduce vehicle tank pressure and to permit the vapour to be consumed by the engine when the engine demands it. However, because engine demands can rapidly change from idle to full power, engine fuel demand is not compromised by undue use of vapour, but instead liquid is supplied essentially instantly when surge tank pressure drops below the low set point. This enables a vehicle to operate for a long period without venting of vapour, as the vapour is automatically removed by burning in the vehicle engine.\nThus, it can be seen that a method of supplying cryogenic fluid fuel to an engine comprises the steps of:\nconducting cryogenic vapour from a tank in a vapour conduit;\nconducting cryogenic liquid from the tank in a liquid conduit; and\nselectively receiving cryogenic liquid and vapour from the respective conduits at an inlet of a pump and pumping cryogenic liquid to satisfy fuel demand, and when the fuel demand is satisfied, pumping cryogenic vapour to reduce vapour pressure in the tank.", "score": 0.81681186, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:a1a4f5ec-9266-49f9-874a-fb69cc7d0eb0>", "text": "How Fast Does a Yamaha 660 Raptor Go?\nThe top speed of a Yamaha Raptor 660R is estimated in the range of 80 to 95 miles per hour.

According to IS-95 operation, the base stations continually transmit the pilot signal which can be used by the remote unit to identify the base station as well as other functions, such as for example, determining the multipath environment the remote unit is operating in and synchronization of remote unit timing to the base station timing.\nDuring initial power on, or any other situation when the remote unit has lost a pilot signal such as when performing a hard hand-off to a different operating frequency, the remote unit evaluates all possible PN offsets of the pilot PN sequence. Typically, a search engine measures the pilot signal strength at all possible PN offsets, proceeding at a measurement rate that produces an accurate measure of the pilot signal present at the corresponding offset. Proceeding in this manner, the search engine determines the PN offset of base stations which are geographically near the remote unit. Searching each PN offset in this manner can take anywhere from hundreds of milliseconds to a few seconds depending on the channel conditions during acquisition. This amount of time for the remote unit to reacquire a pilot signal is detrimental to the remote unit operation, and may be annoying to the user of the remote unit.\nOne purpose of the search engine, as described above, is to aid in maintaining the wireless link between the remote unit and a base station. Because the wireless channel is constantly changing, multi-path searching must be performed on a virtually continuous basis, otherwise the wireless link may be lost due to, for example, fading. If the wireless link is lost, communications between the remote unit and the base station are terminated and the remote unit performs a search of the entire PN space to reacquire an appropriate base station.

It has two O2 measurement electrochemical cells, rather than the single cell that at the time was universal. This same model sensor has been adopted by racing teams to monitor the combustion in each cylinder of racing engines during the tuning process, one per cylinder, because of its sensitivity.\nThe opening of only one intake valve below 2,500 RPM results in much more of the pressure drop between atmospheric pressure, and the inside of the cylinder to be across the valve than would otherwise be the case.

American engines have all been fuel-rich. Some Soviet engines have been oxidizer-rich.\nAdditionally, there is a difference between mixture ratios for optimum Isp and optimum thrust. During launch, shortly after takeoff, high thrust is at a premium. This can be achieved at some temporary reduction of Isp by increasing the oxidiser ratio initially, and then transitioning to more fuel-rich mixtures. Since engine size is typically scaled for takeoff thrust this permits reduction of the weight of rocket engine, pipes and pumps and the extra propellant use can be more than compensated by increases of acceleration towards the end of the burn by having a reduced dry mass.\nAlthough liquid hydrogen gives a high Isp, its low density is a significant disadvantage: hydrogen occupies about 7x more volume per kilogram than dense fuels such as kerosene. This not only penalises the tankage, but also the pipes and fuel pumps leading from the tank, which need to be 7x bigger and heavier. (The oxidiser side of the engine and tankage is of course unaffected.) This makes the vehicle's dry mass much higher, so the use of liquid hydrogen is not such a big win as might be expected. Indeed, some dense hydrocarbon/LOX propellant combinations have higher performance when the dry mass penalties are included.\nDue to lower Isp, dense propellant launch vehicles have a higher takeoff mass, but this does not mean a proportionately high cost; on the contrary, the vehicle may well end up cheaper. Liquid hydrogen is quite an expensive fuel to produce and store, and causes many practical difficulties with design and manufacture of the vehicle.\nBecause of the higher overall weight, a dense-fuelled launch vehicle necessarily requires higher takeoff thrust, but it carries this thrust capability all the way to orbit. This, in combination with the better thrust/weight ratios, means that dense-fuelled vehicles reach orbit earlier, thereby minimizing losses due to gravity drag. Thus, the effective delta-v requirement for these vehicles are reduced.\nHowever, liquid hydrogen does give clear advantages when the overall mass needs to be minimised; for example the Saturn V vehicle used it on the upper stages; this reduced weight meant that the dense-fuelled first stage could be made significantly smaller, saving quite a lot of money.", "score": 0.00023961060097829346, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:81bef531-6ff8-476c-bb61-2e9a76f357d3>", "text": "The engine block has also been stiffened to improve noise and vibration characteristics further.\nBoth of the diesel engines have near identical technical specifications, essentially differing only in engine output and torque.

There are a number of reasons why Haley gets overlooked. He was only a year older than Chuck Berry but seemed more like twenty years older. He looked like a puffy George Reeves, right down to the Superman spit curl, and he favored loud, checked sport jackets, normally associated with vacationing appliance salesmen. (When Jerry Lewis parodied the rock craze in his 1958 film âRock-a-Bye Baby,â his band was costumed the same way, in mimicry of the Comets.) Onstage, Haley lacked the charisma and energy of other early rockers. He wasnât a new teen idol but a familiar type: the bandleader. His Comets were a rockinâ band, but one only as good as its material, and after âShake, Rattle and Rollâ (the first rock-and-roll record to go top ten, in 1954) and âRock Around the Clock,â the quality of their work dropped precipitously. Even Haleyâs most thrilling performances were sexless.

His band, Bill Haley & His Comets performed Rock Around the Clock for the movie, Blackboard Jungle in 1955. The movie itself wasn't memorable, but the song was, although it was only heard in the background in opening and closing credits. Part of reason was that the song was \"new.\" It had a faster rhythm compared to the conventional blues, and a rebellious sound. Most importantly it was sung by a White guy.\nRock Around the Clock became very popular. It enjoyed widespread attention and billboard chart success. The song was favorable among White and Black audiences alike - especially White teenagers. This was the definitive start of the mainstream rock n' roll scene.\nAlthough the song was a massive hit, Bill Haley couldn't prolong his success because he was too old. He didn't fulfill the needs of record companies that were looking forward to reach-out to the massive White teenagers who had enough money in hand to buy songs. This opened door for other rock n' roll artists like Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis, Little Richard, and Chuck Berry. From 1955 to 1959, rock n' roll was more popular than rhythm & blues and country music.\nRacial tensions were still high in the US in 1950s. Classrooms were segregated; Black kids went to night school. Therefore the arrival of rock n' roll wasn't greatly appreciated by White adults, presumably parents. They saw it as a threat to their way of life since music would somehow integrate both White and Black communities together. As a matter of fact, the title Blackboard Jungle has a slight racial tone to it. Elvis was the most prominent artist at the time as he was the only one signed to a major record label. When he appeared on TV to perform Hound Dog, his legs were cut off from TV due \"inappropriate movements.\" In other words, he was White but danced like a Black guy. As far as the parents concerned, such behavior \"crossed the line.\"\nThere were also Black Rock N' Rollers. Chuck Berry was the best example. He was the Black guy who sang like a White guy.

However, data reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that some D/HH children were not documented as having received early intervention services. In addition, some D/HH children may be born with other conditions that also can result in developmental delays. Referring D/HH children to early intervention as soon as possible will help ensure that they can reach their full potential.

If a family refuses your referral to intervention services, be sure to document the parentsâ decision.\nWhat is Early Intervention (EI)?\nEI is a system of services available to children under the age of three who are eligible and may have a developmental or language delay [284KB, 16 pages], disability, or special health condition that is likely to lead to non-typical development. Evaluation and service coordination are provided free of charge.\nIf a child isnât developing as expected in certain areas, the family may be able to receive early intervention services from the stateâs lead agency that works with families and children with different developmental needs.

The main focus of early identification and early intervention for a child with hearing loss is on developing communication skills, both verbal and sign language, to the maximum possible extent. Further, if hearing impairment is associated with other disorders like mental retardation, blindness, cerebral palsy, etc., the intervention program addresses those needs also.\nHearing impairment is detrimental to the normal speech and language development in such children. While speech and language are innate skills of human beings, these skills develop only by hearing, listening and incorporating the use of words, intonations, voice variations, and the patterns in which words are strung together to form expressions.\nWhy Early Intervention?\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a hearing screening to be done for every baby a few weeks after birth, and also follow-up visits up to two years of age. With modern technology of manual and automatic hearing testing routines, congenital hearing loss is being identified in children before they are 3 months of age. Identification of hearing impairment is possible by looking into the risk factors, responses of the baby to sounds around and seeking professional help when the risks and signs indicate a hearing problem.\nRisk Factors for Hearing Loss\nSome of the important risk factors associated with hearing loss can be listed and an informal screening can help in determining whether to look out for signs of hearing impairment. The risk factors include:\nâ¢ Family history of hearing impairment\nâ¢ Prenatal infections in the mother like rubella, herpes simplex and toxoplasmosis\nâ¢ Abnormal development of the structures in head and neck region like cleft palate, atresia (absence of pinna), etc\nâ¢ Premature birth\nâ¢ Medications given in neonatal period\nâ¢ Syndrome associated with hearing loss like Waardenburg, neurofibromatosis, etc\nâ¢ Recurrent infections in the ear, nose and throat\nâ¢ Infections like meningitis, measles, mumps, etc\nâ¢ Head trauma\nCertain symptoms may be noticed by the mother or primary caregiver of the baby that can call for a detailed hearing assessment to be done.", "score": 0.858017921, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:ae5027e9-0b42-4dd3-a40f-01446335461b>", "text": "Permanent childhood hearing loss can be congenital, delayed-onset, progressive, or acquired in nature. Congenital hearing loss refers to hearing loss that is present at birth and is often identified through a newborn hearing screening conducted shortly after birth. While estimates vary, some hearing loss in childhood is delayed-onset or progressive in nature. As a result, it is important to provide audiologic monitoring over time for children who are considered to be \"at risk\" for hearing loss. In addition, some mild hearing losses as well as auditory neuropathy may not be identified through newborn hearing screening due to the current limitations of the test equipment or testing methodology used.\nHearing is critical to speech and language development, communication, literacy, and learning. Early identification and intervention of hearing loss can lessen the impact on a child's development (Sininger, Grimes, & Christensen, 2010; Yoshinaga-Itano, Baca, & Sedey, 2010). The Joint Committee on Infant Hearing (JCIH, 2007) recommends that\n- all children be screened for hearing loss no later than 1 month of age,\n- hearing and medical evaluations be completed no later than 3 months of age,\n- infants with confirmed hearing loss are fit with amplification (if the family chooses and if appropriate) within 1 month of diagnosis,\n- early intervention services begin no later than 6 months of age.\nNote: The scope of this content is limited to the diagnosis and management of permanent hearing loss for children from birth through 5 years of age from an audiological perspective. Resources for hearing screening and habilitation, as well as hearing loss for school-age and adult populations, are under development.\nFamilies who are actively involved in the assessment and treatment process achieve better outcomes (DesJardin, 2006). It is paramount that audiologists incorporate family-centered practice into the identification and treatment of young children who are deaf or hard of hearing; family-centered activities include\n- engaging the family and using the child's toys from home in various aspects of the evaluation and therapy sessions,\n- suspending judgment and building rapport with the family about their needs and interests,\n- matching re/habilitation with the family needs and goals,\n- recognizing the family's rights regarding informed consent and confidentiality.\nThe goal of family-centered practice is to create a partnership with the family so that the family fully participates in all aspects of the child's care.", "score": 0.855637193, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:8070eae0-4547-4fd7-b957-bf027bce8566>", "text": "Language development is impacted if there is any loss in the ability to hear.\nEven a mild hearing loss can dramatically effect a childâs language development.

The statement, published in the February 1999 issue of Pediatrics, discusses the justifications for universal hearing screening, tracking and follow-up, identification and intervention, evaluation, and other recommendations and issues. The AAP establishes parameters with the goal of ensuring that all newborns with hearing loss be identified.\nâSignificant hearing loss is one of the most common major abnormalities present at birth and, if undetected, will impede speech, language and cognitive development,â according to the policy statement. The average age for detection of significant hearing loss in the United States is less than 14 months, but the AAP would like to see all newborns screened before they leave the hospital so that treatment can be initiated before these infants are six months old. The policy states that about one to three per 1,000 infants in well-baby nurseries have significant loss of hearing in both ears, and about two to four per 100 infants in the intensive care unit have hearing loss.\nThe following five essential elements for an effective screening program were identified by the AAP: initial screening with a test having a high degree of sensitivity and specificity; tracking and follow-up; identification; intervention; and evaluation. Guidelines for each of the five essential elements are discussed in the statement. The following guidelines have been excerpted from the section of the guidelines that discusses identification and intervention in a universal neonatal hearing screening program:\nThe goal of universal screening is that 100 percent of infants with significant congenital hearing loss be identified by three months of age, and appropriate and necessary intervention be initiated by six months of age.\nAppropriate and necessary care for the infant with significant hearing loss should be directed and coordinated by the child's physician within the medical home, with support from appropriate ancillary services.\nA regionalized approach to identification and intervention for infants with significant hearing loss is essential, ensuring access for all children with significant hearing loss to appropriate expert services. The AAP recognizes that professionals with competency in this area may not be available in every community. The child's physician, working with the state department of health, must ensure that every infant with significant hearing loss is referred to the appropriate professionals within the regionalized system.", "score": 0.846420109, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:6b4857e3-9773-40c1-bdaf-eefa4c6f3ebc>", "text": "Listening Stars : Parent Infant Program (0-18 Months)\nEarly Intervention plays a vital role.\nEarly diagnosis is the key to successful early intervention.

It is advised not to waste critical time. Critical Period for developing the ability for spoken language is from 0-3 years. At that stage, the brain has the maximum neural Plasticity. The child too must learn early to grow up with the hearing aids/cochlear implant (CI) and accept them easily.

The rescreening may be done at the birth hospital or at an audiologist's (hearing specialist) office.\n- Whenever an infant does not pass the rescreening, we refer them/their family to a participating audiologist for a diagnostic hearing evaluation; this should be performed before the baby is three months old.\n- If the audiologist confirms hearing loss, we then refer the infant and their family to Babynet . This should be done by six months of age. Babynet will work with the family to get the infant the hearing intervention services needed.\nDHEC also tracks infants for three years if they pass their hospital screening but are at high risk for developing hearing loss.\nIf your infant has not been screened for hearing loss or if you are a health care provider wishing to refer an infant to First Sound, contact us at (803) 898-0708.

Studies show that hearing loss occurs in approximately 2-4 out of 1,000 babies.\n- Hearing is vitally important to development of language skills. Infants begin developing speech and language from the moment they are born. Eighty percent of the language ability of a child is established by the age of 18 months.\n- Without early hearing detection and intervention programs like First Sound, hearing loss is often not identified until children are 18 months to 3 years of age.\n- Children with hearing loss who do not receive early intervention and treatment may require extensive (usually publicly funded) special education services.\n- Early detection of hearing loss in a child and early intervention and treatment has been demonstrated to be highly effective.\n- Universal screening/detection of hearing loss in infants before three months of age, with appropriate intervention no later than six months of age, is endorsed by the major speech-language-hearing associations in the U.S. as well as the American Academy of Pediatrics.", "score": 0.07460354853659475, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:d72e4bcf-7440-4209-b653-94b5f7d7908d>", "text": "The United States Preventive Services Task Force has acknowledged the significant effect that congenital hearing loss has on communication skills psychosocial development and educational progress and have found that early detection of hearing loss improves language development.2 Others also have confirmed that language skills are closely linked to early identification of hearing loss3 and prospects to utilization of early intervention services.4 5 Children with congenital hearing loss who are identified and receive intervention no later than 6 months of age perform up to 40 percentile points higher on language expressive measures and interpersonal adjustment within the school setting.6-9 Such delays may lead to adulthood challenges in education and employment.10 Mandatory infant hearing screening has been recommended by the National Institutes of Health 11 Joint Committee on Infant Hearing (JCIH) 12 and the American Academy of Pediatrics15 in order to initiate the process of hearing loss identification and this screening has been implemented in most says.

There has been much work in recent years to reduce the age of diagnosis and intervention for these children. The paper by Pimperton et al,1 provides important evidence to support the observations of those working clinically with these children, that early identification and habilitation of significant hearing impairment in children pays dividends in terms of education. The cohort of children on whom this paper is based was identified by universal newborn hearing screening before the establishment of NHSP, the national newborn hearing screening programme. The same cohort was studied earlier at an average age of 7.9 years2 when significant benefit in language development was shown in those diagnosed before 9 months of age compared with those identified when older than 9 months. The particular value of this paper is that it has looked at performance in the second decade as well as the first, and there is a paucity of work in this age group. Pimperton et al have highlighted the value of early diagnosis and intervention in establishing good language skills, which underpin later reading comprehension.\nManagement of deafness in children has seen a significant change in the last 15 years. Prior to newborn hearing screening, the average age of diagnosis of deafness severe enough to compromise speech and language development (moderate-to-profound deafness bilaterally) was 26 months, with hearing aid fitting at 32.2 months.3 Many of these children failed to acquire good speech and oral language. Amplification using hearing aids gave access to sound, but the late start meant that the critical period for good speech and language acquisition was passed. The average reading age of a deaf school leaver was said to be about 8 years, and career and educational opportunities were, as a consequence, limited.\nThe impetus for change came from the Joint Committee on Infant Hearing, a multidisciplinary American group established in 1969, which first examined the evidence to support early screening and early intervention.

DNA testing may also be helpful.\nLong Term Effects\nWhat are the long-term effects of the disease?\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy causes progressive deterioration of the muscles, and loss of function. The muscle deterioration leads to the use of braces and eventually a wheelchair. Impaired lung function leads to serious lung infections, aspiration, and death.\nWhat are the risks to others?\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy is not contagious. It is an X-linked recessive disorder. This means that an unaffected woman who carries the gene can pass it, on average, to one half of her sons.\nWhat are the treatments for the disease?\nThe major goal of early treatment is to keep the ability to walk as long as possible. Stretching exercises and using braces at night help avoid the tightening of tendons.\nSurgery can be used to release tight tendons. Walking and body movement should be resumed immediately after surgery if possible. Inactivity makes the disease worse and can lead to rapid deterioration of lung function. Prednisone has been shown to slow the progression of the disease for up to three years.\nVaccination against influenza and pneumococcal infections is important. Also, weight control is essential. Obesity adversely impacts physical and respiratory functions.\nHow is the disease monitored?\nAny new or worsening symptoms should be reported to the healthcare provider.\nThe Muscular Dystrophy Association [hyperLink url=\"http://www.mdausa.org/disease/dmd.html\" linkTitle=\"http://www.mdausa.org/disease/dmd.html\"]http://www.mdausa.org/disease/dmd.html[/hyperLink]", "score": 0.831561923, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:5d1f8b12-a6c1-423c-accd-3c53d9e0ff42>", "text": "|Use pulse oximetry to monitor oxygen saturation and pulse rate||To detect changes in oxygenation|\n|Monitor vital capacity in patients with neuromuscular weakness and observe trends||Monitoring detects changes early|\n|Instruct client to deep breathe during waking hours or use an incentive spirometer||Deep breathing distends alveoli and promotes increased gas diffusion|\n|Splint incision to reduce discomfort||Pain or fear of pain interferes with deep breathing|\n|Administer oxygen as prescribed||Supplemental oxygen provides a higher concentration than found in room air|\n|Instruct client to self-administer analgesia before deep breathing and coughing if a patient-controlled analgesia pump is available||Pain is more adequately controlled when an analgesic is given before severe pain develops|\nRisk for Infection\nSkin is considered as a first line of defense against any foreign organism.

It is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness and is one of nine types of muscular dystrophy.\nDuchenne Muscular Dystrophy is caused by an absence of dystrophin, a protein that helps keep muscle cells intact. Symptom onset is in early childhood, usually between ages 3â5. The disease primarily affects boys, but in rare cases, it can affect girls. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is inherited in an X-linked pattern because the gene that can carry a Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy-causing mutation is on the X chromosome. It is caused by mutations of the Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy gene, leading to progressive muscle weakness, loss of independent ambulation by early teens, and premature death due to cardiorespiratory complications.\nSupportive and symptomatic measures are the basis of the treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy patients at every stage of the disease and include non-drug, drug, and surgical procedures. Glucocorticoids have long been established as the standard in the therapy of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.\nDuchenne Muscular Dystrophy Market Key Facts\nThe United States accounts for the largest market size of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, in comparison to EU5 (the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, France, and Spain) and Japan.", "score": 0.015705605584712335, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:f3c286cb-9483-41c0-8cd5-a8f7a394480b>", "text": "â¢ Having a fear of closed spaces\nCatabasis Quarterly: Updates on edasalonexent and clinical trialsWe are pleased to announce that we have ...\nPrognostic Factors Affecting Duchenne Muscular DystrophyDetermination of prognostic factors affe...\nComparative Study of Clinical Endpoint in DMD: Handheld Myometry (HHM) Versus CINRG Quantitative Measurement System ...The aim of the proposed research is to c...\nKinesiology Taping in Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: Effects on Performance, Gait Characteristics, and Energy Consumpt...Investigators investigated that the effe...\nMuscle MRI in Becker Muscular Dystrophy and in Limb-girdle Muscular Dystrophy Type 2IThe purpose of this study is to investig...\nL-citrulline and Metformin in Beckerâs Muscular DystrophyThe purpose of the study is to compare t...\nWhole Body Vibration Therapy in Boys With Duchenne Muscular DystrophyWhole-body vibration therapy (WBVT) is a...\nDuchenne UK: DMD Patient and Caregiver Survey Resultshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2EpSB8R...\nState-of-the-art advances in Duchenne muscular dystrophyDuchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a s...\nAntisense Therapeutics to commence muscular dystrophy trialsAntisense Therapeutics is planning to un...\nThe Treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: Equipoise, Fidelity and Standardshttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji7Z23qH...", "score": 0.002567107278076713, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:51a2ed7e-75db-473c-8522-e282ec6811d0>", "text": "Scuba Diving & Photographyâ¦How Do I Get That Good shot?\nGiven all of the problems we talked about in the last chapter, how can we expect to take pictures that we can be proud of when scuba diving Key Largo? How can we overcome the loss of light and color?\nThere are two answers to this question. One is to take the best possible picture using the available light, and the other is to use a âflashâ. Using a âflashâ is generally referred to as using a strobe in underwater photography. This chapter will concentrate on using available light.\nThe last chapter listed the ways that light gets diffused underwater. So, if we donât have or canât use a strobe we need to avoid all of the things that led to the light reduction. In other words, we need to shoot on a bright day, when the seas are calm, around midday. Luckily, if you are engaged in Key largo scuba diving, these conditions occur fairly frequently. This turtle to the left was taken using only natural, or ambient light.\nAnother time when we can use natural light to our advantage is if we are photographing a very large subject.\nA strobe cannot cover enough area to light these three sperm whales, so that a photograph taken with available light looks quite natural.\nScuba Diving wrecks provide another example of a large subject that looks good when taken in natural light. Sometimes, this natural lighting can be used to produce a black and white image that is quite dramatic, overcoming the lack of color at depth. This picture was taken while scuba diving the wreck of the Duane in the Key Largo National Marine Sanctuary.\nIn addition to pictures of big things, silhouettes can make an interesting subject for natural light photographs. This picture of Christ of The Abyss on Key Largo Dry Rocks was taken using only available light.\nThe Red Filter â A must for the Photographer While Scuba Diving\nOne thing to bear in mind in all these shots is that they obviously donât work for vibrantly colored subjects. To take photographs of highly colored subjects, in addition to good light, we must have a shallow depth. There are however one or two tricks we can use to overcome color loss. The first is to use a red filter.
