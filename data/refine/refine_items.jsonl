The main focus of early identification and early intervention for a child with hearing loss is on developing communication skills, both verbal and sign language, to the maximum possible extent. Further, if hearing impairment is associated with other disorders like mental retardation, blindness, cerebral palsy, etc., the intervention program addresses those needs also.\nHearing impairment is detrimental to the normal speech and language development in such children. While speech and language are innate skills of human beings, these skills develop only by hearing, listening and incorporating the use of words, intonations, voice variations, and the patterns in which words are strung together to form expressions.\nWhy Early Intervention?\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a hearing screening to be done for every baby a few weeks after birth, and also follow-up visits up to two years of age. With modern technology of manual and automatic hearing testing routines, congenital hearing loss is being identified in children before they are 3 months of age. Identification of hearing impairment is possible by looking into the risk factors, responses of the baby to sounds around and seeking professional help when the risks and signs indicate a hearing problem.\nRisk Factors for Hearing Loss\nSome of the important risk factors associated with hearing loss can be listed and an informal screening can help in determining whether to look out for signs of hearing impairment. The risk factors include:\n• Family history of hearing impairment\n• Prenatal infections in the mother like rubella, herpes simplex and toxoplasmosis\n• Abnormal development of the structures in head and neck region like cleft palate, atresia (absence of pinna), etc\n• Premature birth\n• Medications given in neonatal period\n• Syndrome associated with hearing loss like Waardenburg, neurofibromatosis, etc\n• Recurrent infections in the ear, nose and throat\n• Infections like meningitis, measles, mumps, etc\n• Head trauma\nCertain symptoms may be noticed by the mother or primary caregiver of the baby that can call for a detailed hearing assessment to be done.", "score": 0.858017921, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:ae5027e9-0b42-4dd3-a40f-01446335461b>", "text": "Permanent childhood hearing loss can be congenital, delayed-onset, progressive, or acquired in nature. Congenital hearing loss refers to hearing loss that is present at birth and is often identified through a newborn hearing screening conducted shortly after birth. While estimates vary, some hearing loss in childhood is delayed-onset or progressive in nature. As a result, it is important to provide audiologic monitoring over time for children who are considered to be \"at risk\" for hearing loss. In addition, some mild hearing losses as well as auditory neuropathy may not be identified through newborn hearing screening due to the current limitations of the test equipment or testing methodology used.\nHearing is critical to speech and language development, communication, literacy, and learning. Early identification and intervention of hearing loss can lessen the impact on a child's development (Sininger, Grimes, & Christensen, 2010; Yoshinaga-Itano, Baca, & Sedey, 2010). The Joint Committee on Infant Hearing (JCIH, 2007) recommends that\n- all children be screened for hearing loss no later than 1 month of age,\n- hearing and medical evaluations be completed no later than 3 months of age,\n- infants with confirmed hearing loss are fit with amplification (if the family chooses and if appropriate) within 1 month of diagnosis,\n- early intervention services begin no later than 6 months of age.\nNote: The scope of this content is limited to the diagnosis and management of permanent hearing loss for children from birth through 5 years of age from an audiological perspective. Resources for hearing screening and habilitation, as well as hearing loss for school-age and adult populations, are under development.\nFamilies who are actively involved in the assessment and treatment process achieve better outcomes (DesJardin, 2006). It is paramount that audiologists incorporate family-centered practice into the identification and treatment of young children who are deaf or hard of hearing; family-centered activities include\n- engaging the family and using the child's toys from home in various aspects of the evaluation and therapy sessions,\n- suspending judgment and building rapport with the family about their needs and interests,\n- matching re/habilitation with the family needs and goals,\n- recognizing the family's rights regarding informed consent and confidentiality.\nThe goal of family-centered practice is to create a partnership with the family so that the family fully participates in all aspects of the child's care.", "score": 0.855637193, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:8070eae0-4547-4fd7-b957-bf027bce8566>", "text": "Language development is impacted if there is any loss in the ability to hear.\nEven a mild hearing loss can dramatically effect a child’s language development.

Both surveys will be available in English and Spanish.\nHearing loss is the most common disorder that can be detected through newborn screening programs. Prior to the implementation of newborn hearing screening, children with hearing loss typically were not identified until 2 to 3 years of age. This is well beyond the period of early language development. Now, with comprehensive EHDI programs, the average age of identification of children with hearing loss has been reduced so that it is now possible to provide interventions for children younger than one year of age. With early identification, children with hearing loss can begin receiving appropriate intervention services that provide the best opportunity for these children to reach their maximum potential in such areas as language, communication, social and emotional development, and school achievement.\nNewborn hearing screening is only the first step in the identification of children with hearing loss. Children who do not pass their screening need to be further evaluated to determine if they have hearing loss. The value of newborn hearing screening cannot be realized unless children complete the screening, evaluation, and intervention process.

The statement, published in the February 1999 issue of Pediatrics, discusses the justifications for universal hearing screening, tracking and follow-up, identification and intervention, evaluation, and other recommendations and issues. The AAP establishes parameters with the goal of ensuring that all newborns with hearing loss be identified.\n“Significant hearing loss is one of the most common major abnormalities present at birth and, if undetected, will impede speech, language and cognitive development,” according to the policy statement. The average age for detection of significant hearing loss in the United States is less than 14 months, but the AAP would like to see all newborns screened before they leave the hospital so that treatment can be initiated before these infants are six months old. The policy states that about one to three per 1,000 infants in well-baby nurseries have significant loss of hearing in both ears, and about two to four per 100 infants in the intensive care unit have hearing loss.\nThe following five essential elements for an effective screening program were identified by the AAP: initial screening with a test having a high degree of sensitivity and specificity; tracking and follow-up; identification; intervention; and evaluation. Guidelines for each of the five essential elements are discussed in the statement. The following guidelines have been excerpted from the section of the guidelines that discusses identification and intervention in a universal neonatal hearing screening program:\nThe goal of universal screening is that 100 percent of infants with significant congenital hearing loss be identified by three months of age, and appropriate and necessary intervention be initiated by six months of age.\nAppropriate and necessary care for the infant with significant hearing loss should be directed and coordinated by the child's physician within the medical home, with support from appropriate ancillary services.\nA regionalized approach to identification and intervention for infants with significant hearing loss is essential, ensuring access for all children with significant hearing loss to appropriate expert services.

Babynet will work with the family to get the infant the hearing intervention services needed.\nDHEC also tracks infants for three years if they pass their hospital screening but are at high risk for developing hearing loss.\nIf your infant has not been screened for hearing loss or if you are a health care provider wishing to refer an infant to First Sound, contact us at (803) 898-0708. Fax: 803-898-4453\nFacts about Newborn Hearing Loss\n- Hearing loss occurs in newborn infants more frequently than any other health condition for which newborn infant screening is required. Studies show that hearing loss occurs in approximately 2-4 out of 1,000 babies.\n- Hearing is vitally important to development of language skills. Infants begin developing speech and language from the moment they are born. Eighty percent of the language ability of a child is established by the age of 18 months.\n- Without early hearing detection and intervention programs like First Sound, hearing loss is often not identified until children are 18 months to 3 years of age.\n- Children with hearing loss who do not receive early intervention and treatment may require extensive (usually publicly funded) special education services.\n- Early detection of hearing loss in a child and early intervention and treatment has been demonstrated to be highly effective.\n- Universal screening/detection of hearing loss in infants before three months of age, with appropriate intervention no later than six months of age, is endorsed by the major speech-language-hearing associations in the U.S. as well as the American Academy of Pediatrics.", "score": 0.07462270791581511, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:d72e4bcf-7440-4209-b653-94b5f7d7908d>", "text": "The United States Preventive Services Task Force has acknowledged the significant effect that congenital hearing loss has on communication skills psychosocial development and educational progress and have found that early detection of hearing loss improves language development.2 Others also have confirmed that language skills are closely linked to early identification of hearing loss3 and prospects to utilization of early intervention services.4 5 Children with congenital hearing loss who are identified and receive intervention no later than 6 months of age perform up to 40 percentile points higher on language expressive measures and interpersonal adjustment within the school setting.6-9 Such delays may lead to adulthood challenges in education and employment.10 Mandatory infant hearing screening has been recommended by the National Institutes of Health 11 Joint Committee on Infant Hearing (JCIH) 12 and the American Academy of Pediatrics15 in order to initiate the process of hearing loss identification and this screening has been implemented in most says. Newborns who fail their hearing screening or high-risk children undergo an outpatient audiological diagnostic assessment that may take several outpatient encounters in order to obtain definitive diagnosis. Appropriate follow-up through diagnostic and intervention services for children who do not pass a hearing screening or who are diagnosed with hearing loss has become a major national healthcare concern. Disparities in diagnostic and intervention services for some socioeconomic groups are at a high risk of becoming lost to followup.16-18 Patients in rural areas face additional access-to-care barriers that compound these concerns. According to a recent economic statement 19 85 of Kentucky’s 120 counties are considered rural and approximately 1.8 million people Riociguat (BAY 63-2521) live in these counties. Furthermore the Appalachian Riociguat (BAY 63-2521) region of Kentucky which encompasses the eastern and south central portion of the state is considered to be mostly rural based on the 2003 United States Department of Agriculture Rural-Urban Continuum Coding system20 (Beale codes). This Appalachian region is acknowledged nationally as suffering from extreme health disparities and is underserved in healthcare services. The 54 Appalachian counties in Kentucky are plagued by poverty unemployment and a shortage of healthcare. Considering the barriers to any type of care in Appalachia you will find multiple points in the diagnostic and treatment algorithm in which children with hearing loss potentially can be lost to follow up or have a dramatic delay in receiving timely intervention.", "score": 0.0056948192415524875, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:78ed46f4-d922-484a-b79f-816a74c7a2cd>", "text": "Data Management and Quality Assurance\nManaging your program's data is crucial to ensuring the success and quality of your newborn hearing screening program.

There has been much work in recent years to reduce the age of diagnosis and intervention for these children. The paper by Pimperton et al,1 provides important evidence to support the observations of those working clinically with these children, that early identification and habilitation of significant hearing impairment in children pays dividends in terms of education. The cohort of children on whom this paper is based was identified by universal newborn hearing screening before the establishment of NHSP, the national newborn hearing screening programme. The same cohort was studied earlier at an average age of 7.9 years2 when significant benefit in language development was shown in those diagnosed before 9 months of age compared with those identified when older than 9 months. The particular value of this paper is that it has looked at performance in the second decade as well as the first, and there is a paucity of work in this age group. Pimperton et al have highlighted the value of early diagnosis and intervention in establishing good language skills, which underpin later reading comprehension.\nManagement of deafness in children has seen a significant change in the last 15 years. Prior to newborn hearing screening, the average age of diagnosis of deafness severe enough to compromise speech and language development (moderate-to-profound deafness bilaterally) was 26 months, with hearing aid fitting at 32.2 months.3 Many of these children failed to acquire good speech and oral language. Amplification using hearing aids gave access to sound, but the late start meant that the critical period for good speech and language acquisition was passed. The average reading age of a deaf school leaver was said to be about 8 years, and career and educational opportunities were, as a consequence, limited.\nThe impetus for change came from the Joint Committee on Infant Hearing, a multidisciplinary American group established in 1969, which first examined the evidence to support early screening and early intervention. Their latest supplement in 2013 presents current evidence.4 The majority of this research has come from the USA.

This was the teaching of the Greek philosopher Epicurus, who lived from 341 to 270 bc. To many people Epicureanism has often meant a simple devotion to pleasure, comfort, and high living with little thought for the consequences. But the ideas of Epicurus were far more complex. In his lifetime, and for centuries afterward, he was considered a moral reformer.\nThe ideas of Epicurus on how a person should live were based on his understanding of the natural world and on his beliefs about the human body-soul relationship. Like Democritus before him, Epicurus believed that the universe is made up of material bodies and space, or the void. Bodies are composed of individual elements called atoms. The universe is unlimited, and so is the number of atoms. Atoms are of different shapes, and the number of atoms of each shape is infinite.\nBoth the human body and soul are composed of atoms. The atoms of the soul are thin and distributed throughout the body. It is the soul that is responsible for all sense perception. Sensation is the sole source of knowledge, as all sense perceptions are true—whether of seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, or tasting. Error may arise, however, if the mind forms a wrong opinion about what the senses perceive. As long as the soul is protected by the body, it is capable of communicating sensations to it. When it leaves the body it is scattered and lost, and the body is no longer able to feel anything.\nIf sensations are the basis of knowledge, the purpose of knowledge is to avoid those sensations that cause pain and to seek out those that give pleasure both to body and mind. While every pleasure is in itself good, not every pleasure is to be pursued because some pleasures may entail painful consequences or annoyances that outweigh the pleasures themselves. This means that the individual must learn to discriminate between pleasures that are really good and those that only seem to be good.\nTo live well requires the exercise of practical wisdom—moderation, justice, and courage—to balance pleasures against pains and to accept when necessary those pains that lead to greater pleasures. Thus Epicureanism is not just a self-serving attitude. It may be necessary, for example, to engage in battle in order to achieve the greater goal of peace.", "score": 0.013037996533610248, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:a7b9c017-8c2d-4290-8668-9bc04e6f97ca>", "text": "The three elements that make up over 99 percent of organic molecules are carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. These three combine together to form almost all chemical structures needed for life, including carbohydrates, lipids and proteins. Additionally, nitrogen, when paired with these elements, also forms a crucial organic molecule in the form of nucleic acids.\nCarbon is the most essential of elements in forming organic molecules; indeed, life on Earth has been referred to as \"carbon based\" because of the prevalence of carbon in forming essential compounds for organisms. Carbon is so prevalent in organic compounds because of its ability to form up to six stable bonds with other atoms; as a result, carbon is often in the middle of a molecule with several different atoms, and it is this diversity that allows life to flourish. Carbon makes up approximately 10 percent of the human body.\nHydrogen is the most common atom in the universe, and is also the most common element in organic molecules. Because of its singular electron nature, hydrogen atoms occur in high quantities in several organic molecules, often acting as a linking point between the central carbon atom and other atoms. Additionally, hydrogen forms a strong bond with carbon, which gives more stability to an organic molecule than an average molecule. Oxygen makes up approximately 63 percent of the human body.\nOxygen is crucial element in organic molecules because, much like carbon, it can hold several different bonds (though not with the same strength of carbon, thus it is not normally in the middle of an organic molecule) and, importantly, it adds enough variety to form a near infinite amount of molecules. Carbon, hydrogen and oxygen combine to form proteins, carbohydrates (which is a combination of carbon with water) and lipids, all compounds essential to life. Oxygen makes up approximately 26 percent of the human body.\nWhile not nearly as prevalent as carbon, hydrogen and oxygen, nitrogen shows up in an extremely important type of organic molecule called a nucleic acid. The two types of nucleic acids found in cells are DNA and RNA, which make up the genetic blueprint of the cell and contain all the codified information needed for the cell to function and reproduce.

Mater comprises of tiny\nparticles that have energy. Temperature is energy in form of heat. This energy is what is used in cooking food, keeping the living spaces warm and even some machinery uses heat to function. Gas is used in different parts of the world to produce heat that increases temperature.\nTemperature affects different things including human beings. When temperatures are low, people start shivering. When temperatures are high, human beings start sweating. Apart from human beings, temperatures affect other substances in the environment as well. Effects of temperature on these substances affect the volume that they occupy.\nFor instance, the connection between volume and temperature is the basis on what thermometers work. Airtight glass tubes are the most commonly used type of thermometers. These have reservoir bulb in one end. This reservoir contains colored liquid.\nThe volume of this liquid increases as the temperature increases. This forces the liquid to move upward in the narrow tube. Volume of the liquid in the reservoir increases with increasing temperature forcing the liquid in the reservoir to keep moving up the tube. The numbers on the tube translates to the increasing volume of the liquid with increasing temperature.\nThe effect of temperature on volume is seen by the effect that the temperature has on the space that is occupied by the liquid. When temperature is increased, most substances expand. On the other hand, decreasing temperature cause the liquid to contact.\nThe explanation of this reaction can be derived from the behavior of atoms and their size. Everything including liquid is made of tiny particles of matter known as atoms. Even when liquid of anything is not moving, atoms are always moving. Atom of anything are always wriggling around as well as bumping into each other. This is what happens to the atoms of the liquid.\nAs liquid gets hotter the atoms starts moving faster or jostling around more vigorously. As such, they occupy more space increasing the volume that is occupied by the substance. Nevertheless, effect of temperature on volume differs. Some substances will occupy more volume when exposed to high temperatures than others. Others will occupy less volume when exposed to extremely low temperature.", "score": 0.010043361858047434, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:1e3c230e-a42c-45c7-90e6-112c7a022a36>", "text": "How can we help?\nYou can also find more resources in our\nSelect a category\nSomething is confusing\nSomething is broken\nI have a suggestion\nWhat is your email?\nWhat is 1 + 3?\nch2 atoms and bonding\nWhich four elements are the primary components of important biological molecules, such as proteins, fats, and carbohydrates?\nnitrogen, carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen\nWhich of the following molecules is a compound?\nWhich of these refers to atoms with the same atomic number but different atomic masses?\nAn atom and an ion of the same element differ in the number of _____.\nA(n) _____ refers to two or more atoms held together by covalent bonds.\nThis atom can form up to _____ single covalent bond(s).\nThe innermost electron shell of an atom can hold up to _____ electrons.\nAtoms with the same number of protons but with different electrical charges _____.\nare different ions\nAn ionic bond involves _____.\nan attraction between ions of opposite charge\nHow are ionic bonds formed?\none atom gives up an electron to a second atom\nEach water molecule is joined to _____ other water molecules by ____ bonds.\nfour , hydrogen\nThe unequal sharing of electrons within a water molecule makes the water molecule _____.\nThe pH of human blood is maintained at around pH 7.4.

This season, for example, “Roseanne” reigned as the No. 1 new strip in syndication.\n“A great sitcom is still the end of the rainbow for a producer/distributor,” said Greg Meidel, president of Twentieth Television domestic TV.\nBut the market is getting crowded.

Before that it was Full House and Perfect Strangers. Before that it was Family Ties and Growing Pains. The names of the shows changed but the theme of the shows did not. The shows were all about ordinary people getting into situations that were both strange and familiar, and that was where the humor resided. In every one of these sitcoms there was always at least one episode where:\n- a character overextended himself or herself with commitments\n- best friends fight over something and then make up\n- one character tries to lend expertise to another character’s problem, but the character with the problem just wishes the helping character would butt out, but does not want to hurt the helping character’s feelings\n- a character’s professional success makes things weird\n- one character learns an embarrassing secret about another character and spends the whole episode dancing around the secret in various conversations\nEt cetera, et cetera. These sitcoms were surreal. The characters and situations resembled real life, but we all knew, deep down, that real life never worked out that way.\nSitcoms still exist today. I just don’t know anyone who watches them. Everyone I know watches shows where they demonstrate how to prepare food, or how to put up drywall, or how to kick your addiction to hoarding.

This exploits power transmission rights of way effectively, ensures a power company can own and control the fiber required to monitor its own devices and lines, is effectively immune to tampering, and simplifies the deployment of smart grid technology.\nThe transmission distance of a fiber-optic communication system has traditionally been limited by fiber attenuation and by fiber distortion. By using opto-electronic repeaters, these problems have been eliminated. These repeaters convert the signal into an electrical signal, and then use a transmitter to send the signal again at a higher intensity than was received, thus counteracting the loss incurred in the previous segment. Because of the high complexity with modern wavelength-division multiplexed signals (including the fact that they had to be installed about once every 20 km), the cost of these repeaters is very high.\nAn alternative approach is to use optical amplifiers which amplify the optical signal directly without having to convert the signal to the electrical domain. One common type of optical amplifier is called an Erbium-doped fiber amplifier, or EDFA. These are made by doping a length of fiber with the rare-earth mineral erbium and pumping it with light from a laser with a shorter wavelength than the communications signal (typically 980 nm). EDFAs provide gain in the ITU C band at 1550 nm, which is near the loss minimum for optical fiber.\nOptical amplifiers have several significant advantages over electrical repeaters. First, an optical amplifier can amplify a very wide band at once which can include hundreds of individual channels, eliminating the need to demultiplex DWDM signals at each amplifier. Second, optical amplifiers operate independently of the data rate and modulation format, enabling multiple data rates and modulation formats to co-exist and enabling upgrading of the data rate of a system without having to replace all of the repeaters. Third, optical amplifiers are much simpler than a repeater with the same capabilities and are therefore significantly more reliable. Optical amplifiers have largely replaced repeaters in new installations, although electronic repeaters are still widely used as transponders for wavelength conversion.\nWavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) is the practice of multiplying the available capacity of optical fibers through use of parallel channels, each channel on a dedicated wavelength of light.", "score": 0.851137, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:011a1c7a-a361-470b-ae7f-dfa0ae1ede16>", "text": "The efficiency, gain, and signal/noise ratio of three-level devices are quite sensitive to the magnitude and spectrum of the cross sections.

Glasses have been identified which have advantages over silica, particularly for pumping with AlGaAs diode lasers at 800 nm.\nThe gain dynamics of erbium-doped fiber amplifiers are studied both experimentally and theoretically. It is shown that the transients associated with gain saturation and gain recovery during multichannel amplification have long characteristic times, i.e. in the 100 its-1 ms range. Such slow gain dynamics effectively prevent saturation-induced crosstalk and intermodulation distortion effects in the amplification of high-speed WDM and FDM signals.\nA large signal model of an optically pumped Erbium-doped travelling wave fibre amplifier is presented, including the influence of excited state absorption. The maximum gain and optimal amplifier length are discussed, based on the intensity of pump, signal and amplified spontaneous emission. Special attention is given to the gain degradation depending on the mode distribution of the pump light, and noise figures of the amplifier is presented for co- and counter propagating pump light.

Generally, Brillouin type amplifier is not used in optical communication. For a particular use, the decision has to be made about which amplifier to be used. The EDFA amplifier is used in-line amplifier on account of its compatibility. On the other hand, Raman Fiber Amplifier (RFA) will be a very good power amplifier because of its high saturation.\nEDFAs and conventional lasers, achieve gain by pumping atoms into a high energy state. This allows the atoms to release their energy when a photon of a suitable wavelength passes nearby. RFAs utilize Stimulated Raman Scattering (SRS) to create optical gain. Because SRS robs energy from shorter wavelengths and feeds it to longer wavelengths, high channel count DWDM systems initially avoided this technique.\nA RFA amplifier consists of little more than a high-power pump laser, usually called a Raman laser, and a WDM or directional coupler. The optical amplification occurs in the transmission fiber itself, distributed along the transmission path. With amplification up to 10 dB, RFAs provide a wide gain bandwidth (up to 100 nm), allowing them to operate using any installed optical fiber (single mode optical fiber, TrueWave, etc.). By boosting the optical signal in transit, RFAs reduce the effective span loss and improve noise performance.\nCombined with EDFAs, RFAs create a wide gain-flattened optical bandwidth. The figure belwo shows the topology of a typical RFA. The pump laser and optical circulator comprise the two key elements of the RFA amplifier. In this case, the pump laser has a wavelength of 1535 nm. The optical circulator provides a convenient means of injecting light backwards into the transmission path with minimal optical loss.\nHere are the figures which show the optical spectrum of a forward-pumped RFA amplifier and the received signal after the same length of fiber used in the SRS example. The signal gets injected by the 1535 nm pump laser at the transmit end rather than the receive end. Generally, the amplitude of the pump laser exceeds that of the data signals.\nWith a significant decrease in the amplitude of the pump laser, the amplitude of the six data signals has increased, giving all six signals roughly equal amplitudes.

This allows e.g. ASE suppression with filters or modulators between the stages, an optimized power efficiency and noise figure, and possibly a modular approach which increases the flexibility for further amplifier developments.\nMost fiber amplifiers are not made of polarization-maintaining fibers, so they do not preserve the polarization state of the input.

Get your entry!\nDefinition: optical amplifiers with doped fibers as gain media\nFiber amplifiers are optical amplifiers based on optical fibers as gain media. In most cases, the gain medium is a glass fiber doped with rare earth ions such as erbium (EDFA = erbium-doped fiber amplifier), neodymium, ytterbium (YDFA), praseodymium, or thulium. This active dopant is pumped (provided with energy) with light from a laser, such as a fiber-coupled diode laser; in almost all cases, the pump light propagates through the fiber core together with the signal to be amplified. A special type of fiber amplifiers are Raman amplifiers (see below).\nThe originally dominating application of fiber amplifiers was in optical fiber communications over large distances, where signals need to be periodically amplified. Typically, one uses erbium-doped fiber amplifiers with signals of moderate optical power in the 1.5-μm spectral regions. Other important application areas of fiber amplifiers have been developed later. In particular, high-power fiber amplifiers are now used in laser material processing. Typically, these are based on ytterbium-doped double-clad fibers for signals in the spectral region of 1.03–1.1 μm. The output powers can be multiple kilowatts.\nGain and Output Power\nDue to the possible small mode area and long length of an optical fiber, a high gain of tens of decibels can be achieved with a moderate pump power, i.e., the gain efficiency can be very high (particularly for low-power devices). The gain achievable is often limited by ASE (see below). The high surface-to-volume ratio and the robust single-mode guidance also allow for very high output powers with diffraction-limited beam quality, particularly when double-clad fibers are used. However, high-power fiber amplifiers usually have a moderate gain in the final stage, partly due to power efficiency issues; one then uses amplifier chains where the preamplifier provides most of the gain and a final stage the high output power.", "score": 0.29009218389515806, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:44e6b2cb-5003-45ce-97c7-2b1a0ab458df>", "text": "Paschotta, case study on an erbium-doped fiber amplifier|\n|||R.

The feat has impressed developers\nof fibre optic systems around the world, and could mean significant improvements\nin the performance of optical fibres both for long-distance transmissions\nand for sending signals to many separate terminals or subscribers.\nWhen a signal travels through an optical fibre, some of it is lost,\nor attenuated. The signals must, therefore, be amplified after passing through\nroughly 50 kilometres of fibre. In current systems, the optical signals\nmust be converted to an electronic form before they can be amplified by\na repeater.

Inspired by Roerich, a specialist in the primitive iconography of pagan Russia, Nijinsky created a movement style that would embody both the logic and the frenzy of Stravinsky's music.\"\n-- Newsweek November 16, 1987\nWhen Sergei Diaghilev and his Ballets Russes premiered The Rite of Spring, or Le Sacre du printemps (Sacre), at Paris's Theatre des Champs-Elysees on May 29, 1913, a riot broke out. The score by Igor Stravinsky was a panoply of shifting syncopations and dissonant harmonies, while the choreography by famed danseur Vaslav Nijinsky curled the dancers' bodies inward as they jerkily stamped and jumped across the stage. Archaeologist and painter Nicholas Roerich contributed the set design and the costumes, which were described in a 2002 Ballet Magazine article as \"heavy smocks, handpainted with [primitive] symbols of circles and squares.\" The pre-Modernist audience, accustomed to the demure grace of classical ballet, was further outraged by the graphic nature of the ballet's story--the pagan sacrifice of a virgin by her village to usher in spring. Nijinsky's ballet was performed only seven more times--in Paris and London-- before disappearing from the classical repertoire for reasons including Nijinsky's mental breakdown and the deterioration of his relationship with Diaghilev. Many new iterations of the ballet were choreographed--including versions by Pina Bausch and Martha Graham--but only the score remained intact from the initial performances. In FY 1987, the Joffrey Ballet received a National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) grant in Dance of $243,400 \"to support three self-produced seasons in New York City and Los Angeles, and the reconstruction of Vaslav Nijinsky's Le Sacre du Printemps.\"", "score": 0.813625276, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:a6b5b3f7-5f31-4b26-a859-23e9bcb51fa4>", "text": "Just a month before the Nutcracker Suite was premiéred in St. Petersburg, Tchaikovsky hurriedly set about orchestrating and completing ideas from his roughly sketched-out Nutcracker ballet, and compiling them into a short symphonic work, ready for its premiere in March 1892. By this point, he had not even named the work, and in surviving sketches it is referred to as the ‘Fir Tree’ and ‘Christmas Tree’ ballet suites.\nDespite the rush to find something suitable for the concert he was preparing, what became known as the ‘Nutcracker Suite‘ was an instant success. In the same year, it was also performed in Moscow and Chicago, and in the following year, Tchaikovsky conducted performances in Brussels and Odessa, in the Ukraine.\nThe suite has three broad movements, beginning with the Miniature Overture. This cute sonatina opening also opens the ballet, which was premiéred in December 1892, and sets the toy-like, playful tone of the work. Interestingly, this overture does not include any lower strings at all – with only violas and violins performing from the string section, with little bass at all in the orchestra.\nThe Dances follow, with six short dances, from act two, grouped into one larger movement. The famous March opens the movement, before introducing the iconic Dance of the sugar-plum fairy, which used the newly-invented Celeste, almost a cross between a glockenspiel and a piano. Tchaikovsky saw a Celeste for the first time the year before, and wrote to his publisher asking for one – but to keep it a secret… he wanted to be the first to use it. Next, the Russian Dance is followed by the gentle Arabian Dance and the rhythmic Chinese Dance, famous for its difficult, impressive choreography. The Dance of the Mirlitons closes the movement, which is the longest dance by far, using a gentle flute trio for its main motif.\nTchaikovsky closes the suite with the Waltz of the Flowers, a prime example of romantic music. The gentle arpeggio-based melody is introduced by the woodwind section, before a graceful harp cadenza links the Waltz into the music. This is the longest movement by far, with 353 bars, taking around 12 minutes, before bringing the hurriedly-prepared suite to a dignified close.", "score": 0.81182611, "source": "dense"}]}

Yet the work subsequently came to be identified more directly with Stravinsky as composer rather than arranger, in part a consequence of the concert suites he made of the score, including the version from 1922 (revised 1949). While Stravinsky later asserted that the ‘remarkable thing about Pulcinella is not how much but how little has been added or changed’, the alterations are significant enough to turn the music instantly into something unmistakably of the 20th century. Stravinsky began by working directly onto the transcriptions Diaghilev had given him, subtly annotating the melodies and bass lines of arias by Pergolesi, trio sonata movements by Gallo, and even a tarantella by Wassenaer. Sometimes the result was just a representation of the original in Stravinsky’s own accent. No-one could mistake the trombone and double-bass melody of the ‘Vivo’ for anything other than Stravinsky, even though every note of Pergolesi’s music is still present. There are cunning harmonic touches, anachronistic pedal points and off-beat accents that reveal the thumbprint of the arranger, but it remains a loving, albeit humorous, homage to Pergolesi. The same is true of the opening ‘Sinfonia’ (original music by Gallo). Elsewhere, however, Stravinsky declares his hand more decisively. In the ‘Serenata’, for instance, he adds an unchanging drone (an open fifth), which denies the music its forward movement and whose resulting dissonances bestow a languid, melancholic air.", "score": 0.808571756, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:f9325a18-b6d3-45af-9fc3-10071491b8b8>", "text": "Prokofiev's inexperience in ballet led him to revise the work extensively in the 1920s, following Diaghilev's detailed critique, prior to its first production. The ballet's premiere in Paris on 17 May 1921 was a huge success and was greeted with great admiration by an audience that included Jean Cocteau, Igor Stravinsky and Maurice Ravel. Stravinsky called the ballet \"the single piece of modern music he could listen to with pleasure,\" while Ravel called it \"a work of genius.\"\nFirst World War and Revolution\nDuring World War I, Prokofiev returned to the Conservatory. He studied organ in order to avoid conscription. He composed The Gambler based on Fyodor Dostoyevsky's novel of the same name, but rehearsals were plagued by problems and the scheduled 1917 première had to be canceled because of the February Revolution. In the summer of that year, Prokofiev composed his first symphony, the Classical. This was his own name for the symphony, which was written in the style that, according to Prokofiev, Joseph Haydn would have used if he had been alive at the time. It is more or less classical in style but incorporates more modern musical elements (see Neoclassicism). This symphony was also an exact contemporary of Prokofiev's Violin Concerto No. 1 in D major, Op. 19, which was scheduled to premiere in November 1917. The first performances of both works had to wait until 21 April 1918 and 18 October 1923, respectively. He stayed briefly with his mother in Kislovodsk in the Caucasus. Worried about the enemy capturing Saint Petersburg, he returned in 1918. By then he was determined to leave Russia, at least temporarily. He saw no room for his experimental music and, in May, he headed for the USA. Before leaving, he developed acquaintances with senior Bolsheviks including Anatoly Lunacharsky, the People's Commissar for Education, who told him: \"You are a revolutionary in music, we are revolutionaries in life.

Balanchine created dances for five movies, all of which featured Vera Zorina, whom he met on the set of The Goldwyn Follies and who subsequently became his third wife.

He continued to work with contemporary composers, such as Paul Hindemith, from whom he commissioned a score in 1940 for The Four Temperaments.

In that year, two of the 26-year-old composer's works were conducted by Alexander Siloti in St. Petersburg: Scherzo fantastique and Fireworks. Hardly earth-shakers by the lights of what was to come, but sufficiently original and imaginative to make an impression on at least one connoisseur in the audience, Sergei Diaghilev, who was about to launch a new company to perform a mixed season of ballet and opera in Paris. The French capital was at the time particularly taken with the kind of exotic orientalia Russian artists were likely to offer.\nWith dancer-choreographer Mikhail Fokine and scenic artists Leon Bakst and Alexandre Benois on board, Diaghilev lacked only a resident composer to round out his creative staff. That Stravinsky was his man was proven by his successful handling of some test assignments for the opening season of what would be called the Ballets Russes, including the orchestration of Chopin's piano Nocturne in A-flat and Valse brillante in E-flat, for the opening and closing numbers of Fokine's Les Sylphides.\nDuring the company's second season, in 1909, Diaghilev gave his potential resident composer something more demanding. When Anatol Liadov was unable to make much progress on a score commissioned from him for a ballet on the Russian legend of the magical Firebird and the Tsarevich Ivan, Diaghilev transferred the project to Stravinsky, who was at the time living in the country home, near St. Petersburg, of the Rimsky-Korsakov family at the invitation of the late composer's son, Andrei.\nThe lavish production of L'oiseau de feu, as it was called, was first seen in the Paris Opera on June 25, 1910. Choreography was by Fokine, who also danced the role of the Tsarevich. The Firebird was Tamara Karsavina and the conductor Gabriel Pierné, himself a well-known composer at the time.\nThe colorfully melodic score made an overnight star of the composer who would scandalize even the most progressive Paris audience three years later with his Rite of Spring.", "score": 0.80719471, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:2d6a5e3b-3aff-4711-93fa-5e19bda6cb4c>", "text": "Years later, Mr. Salonen considered buying the house, which had fallen on hard times.

An idealist, she maintained that public exposure to good new music was essential to a powerful society, and her aim was to build an auditorium for the Library of Congress to support these goals.\nMrs. Coolidge donated $60,000 to the Library to build the theater and develop the project. She established an annual chamber music festival and commissioned her favorite international composers to create original works. For the third season in 1928, Coolidge determined that she wanted to plan a program with dance as a central focus, and she requested that Carl Engel, chief of the Music Division, contact Adolph Bolm to be choreographer.\nTwo composers, de Falla and Ottorino Respighi, declined the commission, and in 1927 Coolidge contacted Stravinsky to compose a chamber ballet that would be performed at the festival. She set many parameters, requiring that the chamber ballet be 30 minutes in length and employ no more than six dancers and a modest orchestration so that the work would be accommodated on the Coolidge Auditorium's small stage.

He affected hundreds of young dancers with his passionate and demanding pedagogy. Bolm's choreographic legacy in America can be traced from his initial post at the New York Metropolitan Opera through Broadway productions, concert venues, presentation houses and groundbreaking films with directors such as Max Reinhardt and Fritz Lang.\nIn 1917 Bolm created his own company of remarkable international dancers in New York, calling it Ballet Intime. He next moved to Chicago in 1919, where he founded Chicago Allied Arts. Here he worked closely with Ruth Page and secured his associations with many American artists and composers.\nCareer opportunities eventually led Bolm to California, where he made substantial contributions to ballet in San Francisco and to the presentation of dance at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles. He was also one of the five choreographers involved in the founding season for Ballet Theatre in New York, where he staged many works from 1940 until his death. During his career, he preceded many artists in his restaging of classical repertory with integrity and flair, paving the road to more sophisticated dance programming in America.\nAn examination of Bolm's artistic career in America reveals a curious and recurring eclipse of his achievements. The experiences with Diaghilev and Nijinsky and his work with Stravinsky's \"Apollon Musagète\" particularly illuminate this recurrent theme in his career.\nMost ballet enthusiasts link Stravinsky's \"Apollon Musagète\" with George Balanchine, for example.", "score": 0.004146321140634148, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:fe5adefc-275b-46a3-b2d3-32c91d2b8ea9>", "text": "How about “Rite”?\nTo talk about this work at its century mark—to find out what made it so unusual, to explore its ramifications -- we turned to some local experts. We asked a few questions of a musicologist, a pianist participating in a two-piano reading of the score and a conductor. Here’s what they had to say about “Rite.”\nMark Clague, associate professor of musicology, University of Michigan.\n“A close friend,” is what U-M musicologist Mark Clague calls “The Rite.”\n“I wore the grooves smooth on my first Philadelphia Orchestra LP of ‘The Rite’ when I was a teen-ager,” he wrote in an e-mail, “and thus know every twist and turn in the music from the opening wind solos to the 11 bass drum blasts and final orchestral collapse.”\nQ. So how vital is this music still, both for people like you who know it well, and for folks coming to it as novice listeners?\nA. Even at the ripe old age of 100, Stravinsky's “Rite” still pulses with excitement. It demands the best of technical and expressive playing from each and every musician and flawless rhythm from the conductor.\nI had the wild experience two years ago of hearing “The Rite” expertly performed by a regional orchestra that had never done it before. Many of the audience members present had never heard “The Rite” before and were blown away by its angularity and raw emotional power. .\nTalking to people hearing the music for the first time renewed my understanding of Stravinsky's revolutionary accomplishment.\nQ. Which was what?\nA. Stravinsky's three ballet scores for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes — “The Firebird” (1910), “Petrushka” (1911), and “The Rite” (1913) — are among the most influential compositions of the 20th century. They featured dozens of innovations in rhythm, harmony and orchestration that made the young composer an international sensation and influenced composers from Edgard Varese and Olivier Messiaen to Aaron Copland and Philip Glass. Stravinsky and Schoenberg came to define the two opposing poles of musical aesthetics for their age.\n“The Rite” was revolutionary in all its dimensions from Stravinsky's score to Vaslav Nijinsky's choreography and the costumes by Nikolai Roerich.", "score": 0.003929418572304048, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:33dd51cf-1399-4892-80e9-0866208186af>", "text": "Well, sometimes even the jaded low expectations of your at times not-so-humble critic are upended and he is left wondering how he ever could have doubted in the first place. When I initially got this DVD of a 2003 \"reworking\" of Igor Stravinsky's monumental ballet Le Sacre du Printemps, I asked myself how anyone could have messed with the original conception, famously choreographed by Nijinsky under the overall direction of Diaghilev (putting aside for a moment the fact that Nijinsky's choreography was never notated to any great degree, leaving historians to ponder what that production might have really looked like). The 1913 premiere of the work notoriously ended with the audience rioting (and not in a good way), even as Nijinsky stood in the wings screaming out beats to the wildly fluctuating time signatures and tempi as his dancers sought to keep up with the primal music. My, how times have changed. Large swaths of Stravinsky's score sound positively elegantly melodic to modern ears, and the pounding primitive polyrhythms, along with such devices as Stravinsky's famous \"seven note chord,\" simply sound like another World Music extravaganza to ears that have, in the intervening decades since Stravinsky broke virtually every compositional rule in crafting this piece, grown accustomed to dissonance and polytonalities all set to layered beats that, to slightly paraphrase American Bandstand, may not be all that easy to dance to and yet are highly propulsive.\nGerman choreographer and ballet director Uwe Scholz, who passed away at a relatively young age shortly after these two (yes, two, more about which later) versions of Le Sacre were filmed, has not only radically reimagined the piece (twice), he manages to virtually paint the score with the human body (Scholz not only choreographed, but also designed the sets, costumes and lighting for these versions).

More recent technology was solely used by the military until 2006. The first commercial permits for drones were issued by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to aid search efforts for survivors during natural disasters.\nToday, in addition to being part of search and rescue missions, drones are also heavily used to transport critical cargo and obtain data and images for:\n- Land surveillance\n- Law enforcement\n- Health care providers\n- Wildlife tracking\n- Disaster response teams\nDrones can provide deliveries where timing is crucial, such as for organ transplants. However, as with all useful technology, it is important to also understand what security risks they could pose.\nIn this month’s newsletter, PKSD discusses some important concerns, such as safety and privacy, that are arising out of the increased use of commercial and private drones.\nIs There Any Privacy Under Modern Technology’s Watchful Eye?\nMany people have concerns about how drones will affect their privacy. Currently all unmanned aircraft systems (UASs), even those for private use, must be registered with the FAA, and there are certain operational restrictions that an unmanned aircraft systems operator (UAS operator) must follow. However, there are currently no federal restrictions that would prevent a UAS from flying over residential areas.\nLaws That Protect Drones\nSome may be tempted to try and knock one of these unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) out of the sky, especially if it seems to be infringing on your privacy. However, it is a federal crime to knock down or even jam the signal of a drone or any other aircraft regulated by the FAA.\nRisks to Physical Safety\nAs the usefulness of drones increases, our Milwaukee personal injury lawyers are concerned not just about the impact to our privacy, but also the safety issues. The list of possible threats to physical safety is a long one, especially because of the various places a small unmanned UAS can go.

The purpose of this review article is to provide a thorough overview about these aspects. Protein domains are basic units defining protein interactions, and the uniqueness of viral domain repertoires, their mode of evolution, and their roles during viral infection make viruses interesting models of study. Mutations at protein interfaces can reduce or increase their binding affinities by changing protein electrostatics and structural properties. During the course of a viral infection, both pathogen and cellular proteins are constantly competing for binding partners. Endogenous interfaces mediating intraspecific interactions—viral–viral or host–host interactions—are constantly targeted and inhibited by exogenous interfaces mediating viral–host interactions. From a biomedical perspective, blocking such interactions is the main mechanism underlying antiviral therapies. Some proteins are able to bind multiple partners, and their modes of interaction define how fast these “hub proteins” evolve. “Party hubs” have multiple interfaces; they establish simultaneous/stable (domain–domain) interactions, and tend to evolve slowly. On the other hand, “date hubs” have few interfaces; they establish transient/weak (domain–motif) interactions by means of short linear peptides (15 or fewer residues), and can evolve faster. Viral infections are mediated by several protein–protein interactions (PPIs), which can be represented as networks (protein interaction networks, PINs), with proteins being depicted as nodes, and their interactions as edges. It has been suggested that viral proteins tend to establish interactions with more central and highly connected host proteins. In an evolutionary arms race, viral and host proteins are constantly changing their interface residues, either to evade or to optimize their binding capabilities. Apart from gaining and losing interactions via rewiring mechanisms, virus–host PINs also evolve via gene duplication (paralogy); conservation (orthology); horizontal gene transfer (HGT) (xenology); and molecular mimicry (convergence).

Cells were then incubated at 37°C for two days, at which time the extent of infection was gauged by luciferase assay. We added blocking reagents targeting a range of HCV cell entry factors at various times before or after the binding phase. If a given entry factor had already been utilized by the virus, then the blocking reagent would be ineffective, thus indicting the point in the entry process that the entry factor is required.\nUsing this assay we found that both HCVpp and HCVcc exhibit similar entry factor usage patterns in HepG2 cells (Figure 6A and B).

Furthermore, the kinetics of loss of inhibition with antibodies to CD81, CLDN1, and OCLN suggests that these entry factors are used in this order by the incoming particle. This finding is most easily illustrated by focusing on the 60 minute time point (Figure 6A and B, highlighted with dotted line brackets), when CD81 antibody inhibition is nearly completely lost, CLDN1 antibody inhibition is reduced by approximately half, and OCLN directed FLAG antibody still retains most of its blocking potential.

The ability of MHV to cause cell-cell fusion at neutral pH while requiring endocytic uptake for virus-cell fusion suggests different requirements and triggers for these two fusion processes. Similarly, RSV was recently shown to enter cells after endocytic uptake despite the ability of this virus to cause cell-cell fusion .\nThe present study confirms and extends previous publications on MHV entry via clathrin-mediated endocytosis , . Both siRNAs downregulating clathrin-mediated endocytosis-associated proteins, such as clathrin heavy chain (CLTC) and Dynamin 2 (DNM2), and agents affecting this uptake pathway (Chlopro, Dynasore, Dyngo-4a) were capable of inhibiting infection with MHV. Importantly, these findings could be confirmed in our novel replication-independent virus-cell fusion assay, thereby directly showing an involvement of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in entry of MHV. Analysis of several accessory factors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis showed that clathrin-mediated entry of MHV strain A59 depends on clathrin-adaptor DAB2, but not on EPS15 or AAK1. Previously, clathrin-mediated entry of MHV strain 2 was also shown to be independent of EPS15 .", "score": 0.813615203, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:2c64078a-c554-4f1d-8f8e-d5e572c91507>", "text": "The virus enter cells by receptor mediated endocytosis and form a vesicle known as an endosome. Proteins in the third layer (VP7 and the VP4 spike) disrupt the membrane of the endosome, creating a difference in the calcium concentration, this causes the breakdown of VP7 trimers into single protein subunits, leaving the VP2 and VP6 protein coats around the viral dsRNA, forming a double-layered particle (DLP).\nThe eleven dsRNA strands remain within the protection of the two protein shells and the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase creates mRNA transcripts of the double-stranded viral genome. By remaining in the core, the viral RNA evades innate host immune responses including RNA interference that are triggered by the presence of double-stranded RNA.\nDuring the infection, rotavirus produces mRNA for both protein biosynthesis and gene replication. Most of the rotavirus proteins accumulate in viroplasm, where the RNA is replicated and the DLPs are assembled; in the viroplasm the positive sense viral RNAs that are used as templates for the synthesis of viral genomic dsRNA are protected from siRNA-induced RNase degradation. Viroplasm is formed around the cell nucleus as early as two hours after virus infection, and consists of viral factories thought to be made by two viral nonstructural proteins: NSP5 and NSP2. Inhibition of NSP5 by RNA interference in vitro results in a sharp decrease in rotavirus replication, the DLPs migrate to the endoplasmic reticulum where they obtain their third, outer layer (formed by VP7 and VP4). The progeny viruses are released from the cell by lysis.\nRotavirus is transmitted by the fæcal-oral route, via contact with contaminated hands, surfaces and objects, and possibly by the respiratory route. Viral diarrhoea is highly contagious, the faeces of an infected person can contain more than 10 trillion infectious particles per gram; fewer than 100 of these are required to transmit infection to another person.\nRotaviruses are stable in the environment and have been found in estuary samples at levels up to 1–5 infectious particles per US gallon, the viruses survive between 9 and 19 days.

For example, when HIV enters a host CD4 cell, HIV RNA is first changed to HIV DNA (provirus).\nWhat is an example of a Lysogenic virus?\nAs the lysogenic cycle allows the host cell to continue to survive and reproduce, the virus is reproduced in all of the cell’s offspring. An example of a bacteriophage known to follow the lysogenic cycle and the lytic cycle is the phage lambda of E. coli.\nWhich best describes the lysogenic cycles?\nLysogeny, or the lysogenic cycle, is one of two cycles of viral reproduction. Lysogeny is characterized by integration of the bacteriophage nucleic acid into the host bacterium’s genome or formations of a circular replicon in the bacterial cytoplasm.\nDo all viruses have Lysogenic cycle?\nNo matter the shape, all viruses consist of genetic material (DNA or RNA) and have an outer protein shell, known as a capsid. There are two processes used by viruses to replicate: the lytic cycle and lysogenic cycle. Some viruses reproduce using both methods, while others only use the lytic cycle.\nWhat’s the difference between prophage and Provirus?\nProphage – bacterium infected by bacteriophages that integrated his genome in the chromosome of the bacterium. Provirus – eukaryota cell infected by a virus that integrated his genome in the genome of the cell. Bacteriophages do NOT usually infect bacteria, they always infect bacteria.\nWhat happens during Lysogenic infection?\nIn lysogenic infection, viral DNA gets integrated with the host cell’s DNA, where it is copied along with the host cell’s DNA when the host cell replicates.

To call the interactions that have ensued “complicated” is a significant understatement.\nMeet the combatants\nOne of the groups involved is the Lepidoptera, the butterflies and moths. They are seemingly the victims in this story because, like any other species, they can be infected by viruses.

These approaches are expected to clarify the gene regulatory network controlled by CRL1 and to identify new genes for adventitious root development. The allelic diversity of the most interesting genes will be studied in a rice variety population with regard to the variability of the architecture of the root system. We thus hope to identify allelic forms associated with characteristics of density of the root system favorable to a better tolerance to water stress, which could be introduced in the selection programs (Sanguineti et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2008 ).\nMechanism of rice resistance to viruses\nIn recent years several new viral strains have appeared in Vietnam and greatly affect rice growing (Du et al., 2005). Virus resistance genes are infrequent and often quickly bypassed. We therefore wish to develop research aimed at developing, through genetic engineering, multiple and lasting resistances against viral infections (Shimizu et al., 2009). This first requires a study and knowledge of the diversity of these viruses and their biology (in particular their mechanisms of resistance to RNA interference). In this project we will mainly focus on two viruses particularly prevalent in Vietnam: the Rice grassy stunt virus (RGSV, Tenuivirus) and the Rice ragged stunt virus (RRSV, Phytoreovirus). Strains of these viruses will be collected in North and South Vietnam and then sequenced. The variable and conserved areas of the genome of these viruses will thus be identified (Fargette et al., 2008). These studies will identify areas of the viral genome to be targeted by RNA interference.

RNA silencing-based immunity is the cornerstone of plant and invertebrate defense against viral pathogens, and examples of host defense mechanisms and numerous viral counterdefense mechanisms exist. Recent studies indicate that RNA silencing might also play an active role in the context of a mammalian virus infection. We show here that a mammalian virus, human adenovirus, interacts with RNA silencing pathways during infection, as the virus produces microRNAs (miRNAs) and regulates the expression of Dicer, a key component of RNA silencing mechanisms.\nOur work demonstrates that adenovirus encodes two miRNAs within the loci of the virus-associated RNA I (VA RNA I). We find that one of these miRNAs, miR-VA “g”, enters into a functional, Argonaute-2 (Ago-2)-containing silencing complex during infection. Currently, the cellular or viral target genes for these miRNAs remain unidentified. Inhibition of the function of the miRNAs during infection did not affect viral growth in a highly cytopathic cell culture model. However, studies from other viruses implicate viral miRNAs in the establishment of latent or chronic infections.\nAdditionally, we find that adenovirus infection leads to the reduced expression of Dicer. This downregulation does not appear to be dependent on the presence of VA RNA or its associated miRNAs. Rather, Dicer levels appear to inversely correlate with the level of viral replication, indicating that another viral gene product is responsible for this activity. Misregulation of Dicer expression does not appear to influence viral growth in a cell culture model of infection, and also does not lead to gross changes in the pool of cellular miRNAs. Taken together, our results demonstrate that RNA silencing pathways are active participants in the process of infection with human adenovirus.", "score": 0.0009468251933143777, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:78aa628d-f463-4c5d-b6c5-4f48c9dd09e4>", "text": "Previous studies have ascribed specific patterns to the seasonal and annual variations in respiratory virus epidemics and suggested that interference between viruses is the reason for peak fluctuations.33,34 However, these studies report the interference between outbreaks of HRSV and influenza infections. We suggest that, in addition to influenza, HRSV may have a possible interference also with HRV. Thus, further research is needed to elucidate these hypotheses.\nIt is important to note some limitations linked to the results, since, although São José do Rio Preto has 43 daycare centers, only one was authorized by the City Department of Education to implement this study. Hence, we believe that undertaking the study in a single daycare is not enough sample to represent the distribution of respiratory viral infections and to assess how respiratory viruses circulate in the city. Moreover, the percentage of viruses detected may be due to the lack of homogeneity of population in terms of age, because there were variations in the number of children in each age group. As already said, the literature reports a high percentage of viral infection in children under the age of 24 months, and the majority of children in our study population were older than this age group.\nTherefore, we highlight the importance of further studies with larger number of daycare centers and with homogenization of age groups, which would allow a comparison between the results and a delineation of the profile of the children affected by respiratory infections, as well as increased knowledge about the behavior of viral agents that circulate in the daycare centers of the city.\nNevertheless, this work is relevant to the investigation of respiratory infections in daycare centers, considering the scarcity, in the literature, of this type of study in the Brazilian population. Our study is one of the few conducted in Brazil with children attending daycare centers and shows the clinical and epidemiological importance of respiratory tract infections caused by respiratory viruses in children.

Inside cells, there are enzymes that destroy the RNA of viruses. This is called RNA interference. Some blood cells engulf and destroy other virus infected cells.\nAdaptive immunity of animals\nSpecific immunity to viruses develops over time and white blood cells called lymphocytes play a central role. Lymphocytes retain a \"memory\" of virus infections and produce many special molecules called antibodies. These antibodies attach to viruses and stop the virus from infecting cells. Antibodies are highly selective and attack only one type of virus. The body makes many different antibodies, especially during the initial infection, however, after the infection subsides, some antibodies remain and continue to be produced, often giving the host life-long immunity to the virus.\nPlants have elaborate and effective defence mechanisms against viruses. One of the most effective is the presence of so-called resistance (R) genes. Each R gene confers resistance to a particular virus by triggering localised areas of cell death around the infected cell, which can often be seen with the unaided eye as large spots. This stops the infection from spreading. RNA interference is also an effective defence in plants. When they are infected, plants often produce natural disinfectants which kill viruses, such as salicylic acid, nitric oxide and reactive oxygen molecules.\nResistance to bacteriophages\nThe major way bacteria defend themselves from bacteriophages is by producing enzymes which destroy foreign DNA. These enzymes, called restriction endonucleases, cut up the viral DNA that bacteriophages inject into bacterial cells.\nVaccination is a way of preventing diseases caused by viruses. Vaccines simulate a natural infection and its associated immune response, but do not cause the disease. Their use has resulted in a dramatic decline in illness and death caused by infections such as polio, measles, mumps and rubella. Vaccines are available to prevent over thirteen viral infections of humans and more are used to prevent viral infections of animals. Vaccines may consist of either live or killed viruses. Live vaccines contain weakened forms of the virus, but these vaccines can be dangerous when given to people with weak immunity.

And we believe that in order to get a more powerful vaccine, people are going to want one that minimizes this interference,” said Ned Wingreen, a professor of molecular biology.\nWhen Ndifon and colleagues analysed data about viral structure, antibody types and the reactions between them produced by virology laboratories across the country, they noticed a confusing pattern.\nThey found that antibodies were often better at protecting against a slightly different virus, a close cousin, than against the virus that spurred their creation-a process known as cross-reactivity.\nOn a closer look, they found that a phenomenon known as antibody interference was at play-it arises when a virus prompts the creation of multiple types of antibodies.\nAs a result, during a viral attack, antibodies vie with each other to defend the body, and sometimes crowd each other out while they attempt to attach themselves to the surface of the virus.\nBut, strangely, antibodies that are actually less effective at protecting the body against a specific virus are also equally adept at attaching themselves to the virus, blocking the more effective antibodies from doing their job.\nThus, the scientists have suggested that if a way can be found to weaken the binding of the less effective antibodies, this might constitute a new approach to vaccine design.\nThe researchers claimed that the pattern of enhanced cross-reactivities could easily be attributed to viruses that differ only at the sites on their surfaces where the less effective antibodies bind.\nSuch variants would make ideal vaccine strains, guiding the immune system to produce two distinct types of antibodies: effective ones that are well matched to and good at binding to the infecting virus, and ineffective ones that are poorly matched to and bad at binding to the infecting virus, and consequently stay out of the way.\nThe findings have been described in the online edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.", "score": 0.00024409060447773228, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:eec39bb6-b5e9-4373-a99f-4a4cc6064f57>", "text": "Who did it?

Then the questions turned toward scandals that have engulfed the track world and have marginally involved her. What about her relationship with Charlie Francis? What about Balco and Victor Conte? What about the state of her sport?\nJones answered every question with the grace of royalty, the precision of a lawyer and the dexterity of a politician.\n''I believe in a drug-free sport and drug-free competition,'' Jones said.\nFinally, Skip Stolley, the meet organizer of the Millrose Games, stepped in and interrupted. Jones was finished answering drug questions. This was about the Millrose Games and her comeback after a yearlong maternity leave.\nFor the second time in two days, someone involved with Jones attempted to define the terms of an interview. During a conference call with a few reporters on Tuesday, a USA Track & Field representative took a voice count of invited guests. She asked an uninvited reporter how he had gotten an invitation. The reporter was allowed to stay for a broad-ranging conversation that covered Jones's comeback, her baby and, once again, questions about performance-enhancing drugs, Balco and Francis.\nTomorrow, in a rare indoor appearance at Madison Square Garden, Jones will run the 60 meters in a race that will also feature Allyson Felix, the 18-year-old Californian who broke Jones's 200-meter high school record last June.\nJones's comeback is intriguing. There are emerging dynamics between three conflicting camps -- a public relations staff trying to fashion a new image for her, one segment of the news media enamored of Jones's charisma and talent, and another part that is following the scent of an emerging drug scandal. With the best of intentions, the people around Jones want to manufacture the news and her image much as they did leading to the 2000 Sydney Games, when Jones's quest for five gold medals became an obsession. (She won three.)\nThere is a new reality, however. Jones is 28 and a mother who has been touched -- however gently -- by the breeze of a scandal involving a sport that she rules.", "score": 0.04538006921718685, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:7c68c87c-f557-424c-904c-b6463040fa70>", "text": "Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative\n|Part of a series on|\n|Doping in sport|\nThe Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO) (1984–2003) was an American company led by founder and owner Victor Conte. In 2003, journalists Lance Williams and Mark Fainaru-Wada investigated the company's role in a drug sports scandal later referred to as the BALCO Affair. BALCO marketed tetrahydrogestrinone (\"the Clear\"), a then-undetected, performance-enhancing steroid developed by chemist Patrick Arnold. Conte, BALCO vice president James Valente, weight trainer Greg Anderson and coach Remi Korchemny had supplied a number of high-profile sports stars from the United States and Europe with \"the Clear\" and human growth hormone for several years.\nHeadquartered in Burlingame, California, BALCO was founded in 1984. Officially, BALCO was a service business for blood and urine analysis and food supplements. In 1988, Victor Conte offered free blood and urine tests to a group of athletes known as the BALCO Olympians. He then was allowed to attend the Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea. From 1996, Conte worked with well-known American football star Bill Romanowski, who proved to be useful to establish new connections to athletes and coaches such as Korchemny. Conte and Korchemny shortly thereafter founded the ZMA Track Club for marketing purposes, well-known members of it being sprinters Marion Jones and Tim Montgomery. In 2000, Conte managed to contact American baseball star Barry Bonds via Greg Anderson, a coach working in a nearby fitness studio. Bonds then delivered contacts to other baseball professionals.\nIn 2003, the United States Attorney for the Northern District of California began investigating BALCO. U.S. sprint coach Trevor Graham had given an anonymous phone call to the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) in June 2003 accusing a number of athletes being involved in doping with a steroid that was not detectable at the time. He also named Victor Conte as the source of the steroid. As evidence, Graham delivered a syringe containing traces of tetrahydrogestrinone, nicknamed \"the Clear.\"\nShortly after, Don Catlin, MD, the founder of the UCLA Olympic Analytical Laboratory, developed a testing process for tetrahydrogestrinone (THG).", "score": 0.03946783374673555, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:b30d3dec-5709-4d88-9427-07553e35b4b9>", "text": "Its archetypal form, sometimes incorporating or implying the projection of beams, is the underside of eaves to connect a retaining wall to projecting edge s of the roof .\nThe Best Flooring for Your Outside Patio.

The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency sought the bans based on evidence gathered in the criminal investigation of Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative.\nUSADA had requested four-year suspensions for both sprinters. But CAS, the highest court in sports, cut the penalty in half.\nThe bans began retroactively on June 6, 2005. In addition, all Montgomery's results and prize money since March 31, 2001, and Gaines' performances since Nov. 30, 2003, were nullified.\nThat means Montgomery's former world 100-meter record is erased. He ran 9.79 seconds in Paris in September 2002. The record has since been broken by Jamaica's Asafa Powell, who ran 9.78 on June 14 in Athens, Greece.\nCAS said it partly based its ruling on testimony by Kelli White, a former world sprint champion who was suspended for two years in 2004 in the BALCO case. White testified that Montgomery and Gaines admitted to her that they used a prohibited substance provided by the lab.\n\"The panel unanimously found that Ms. White's testimony was both credible and sufficient to establish that the athletes had indeed admitted to have used prohibited substances in violation of applicable anti-doping rules,\" CAS said.\nThe panel said Montgomery and Gaines declined to testify at their hearings.\nUSADA can ban athletes without a positive doping test if there is other sufficient \"analytical\" evidence.

For example, some vendors like HubSpot require partners to hit yearly revenue targets, or take technical and sales training programs and become certified sellers.\nFor example, when customers are researching software, they may find that the software they need doesn’t exist in one package; a VAR can help customize the software to their specific requirements. VARs are particularly helpful for certain industries. In fact, many VARs specialize in certain industries such as the financial or healthcare industries, so they understand the regulations and technical requirements of their customers, and they can provide customized software with greater detail and efficiency because of their knowledge of a specific industry. These VARs also have the background knowledge and data to understand what your market’s pain points are at each stage of the funnel.\nWhile the Value Added Reseller Channel is a popular choice, the traditional VAR model may not be the right choice for all SaaS products. Not to worry, just like putting a porsche engine in a old VW campervan, you can also customize your VAR partner model with an engine that suits your software.

However, it wasn’t until the mid-1990s that CRMs really started to gain traction in the business world. Nowadays, they have become an essential tool for private equity businesses to manage customer relationships more effectively.\nCloud-based/SaaS CRM is all about easy accessibility and maintenance.

Companies can now leverage partnerships to deploy charging infrastructure, lower payback time, and incentivize customers to shop while charging. For instance, supermarkets and shopping malls can build chargers and offer discounts, loyalty points, and other incentives to customers using their charging infrastructure. Zunder has partnered with Nissan to offer a 50% discount on any of their CHAdeMO chargers at their charging stations, while Parking Energy has collaborated with four of Finland’s leading parking operators to provide customers with easy access to their charging stations.\nCompanies now also offer a “bundled” installation model, selling multiple solutions bundled into a single offering. Gridserve is one such example, providing a comprehensive package that includes the installation of EV charging stations, solar panels, EV leasing, and more. Stations-e is another example, offering a local fast-charging stations network and installing high speed mobile networks + other ancillary services. Another example of bundled offering is charging software where charging software can optimise a wide array of charging improvements e.g. balancing peak grid demand, reducing strain on the electricity network, managing charge times and levels etc – please refer to our EV Charging Software article.\nLastly, the market standardisation of charging protocols and its wider adoption will drive the best possible user experience. A prime example of this is ISO 15118’s Plug & Charge, which eliminates the need for users to use multiple different apps for different networks or credit cards. This standard specifies communication between EVs and charging stations, enabling Plug and Charge functionality. This standardisation will drive go-to-market innovations by providing a healthier set of charging options for consumers that are not siloed to individual brands.\nInnovations in charging are driving fundamental shifts in how charging can be done (instead of today’s plug-in-only solutions).\nBroad spectrum of functionalities:\nEV companies are developing a variety of plug-in charging options for various EV charging needs. For example, Virta offers a comprehensive range of charging services, including standard, fast and ultra-fast charging. This enables a more reliable and efficient charging experience and gives users more flexibility regarding when and where they charge their vehicles. Trojan Energy has developed a flat and flush on-street charging solution, with the charging points staying underground when not used so there is more street space available.", "score": 0.823324084, "source": "dense"}]}

Publishers nonetheless praise such ‘lift and shift’ services because they are well suited to clients who are reluctant to adopt ERP products in SaaS mode but still want to take advantage of the scalability and management peace of mind that a cloud infrastructure brings.\nThe multitenant on-demand offering is the purest form of cloud (SaaS).\nThis is followed by the ‘monotenant on-demand’ model, where each customer has their own instance of the ERP software that runs on the vendor’s platform. In this ‘single-tenant SaaS’ model, the customer continues to have the scalable computing power and the flexibility of subscription pricing, but their data and ERP system is kept separate from other customers. Some companies choose this option for their security and confidentiality reasons or to meet the countries’ legal compliance in which they operate.\nThe two types of SaaS ERP (multitenant and single-tenant) are often hosted in a public cloud. The infrastructure and services depend on a provider other than the ERP publisher.\nThe third significant type of cloud ERP is the ‘private cloud.’ Monotenant SaaS is often one of them. In private cloud ERP, the software and hardware are those of a single customer. In some cases, the ERP client even exercises some control over the data center and does not delegate all the host’s responsibilities. A private cloud ERP can even run on-site within the walls of the client company. Rather than cloud, we could therefore speak of ERP in ‘hosted and managed mode.’\nIt is possible to combine private cloud and public cloud for an ERP, depending on the modules and layers. The same is right in the public cloud-only, where multitenant may be relevant for some layers and not for others. A customer can take advantage of the benefits of pooling at the database, operating system and hardware level while running their ERP application monotonously.\nCost-Efficient Cloud Storage\nIf you require a cloud solution that provides you cost-efficient storage, then an OpenStack based cloud is for you.

When the buyer is at the evaluation stage of the journey, you can help customers realize that your software is the answer to their problems and that it is the best choice on the market by publishing content that answers the questions and concerns they may have. For instance, when the buyer is going through the software evaluation process, you could publish a software buyer guide that informs the buyer of the pros and cons of similar software products on the market.\nJust as we take stock of what we want and need when buying a car, and then research each vehicle before heading to the car dealers, buyers will conduct over 60% of their research online before contacting a seller. According to TechTarget 65% of IT buyers will consume at least four pieces of content before contacting the vendor, and the 2014 B2B Buyer Behavior Survey from Demand Gen states that over 61% of buyers will choose the vendor that supplied relevant information at each stage of their journey.\nIt’s all about building trust in your product and company. Therefore, it makes sense to invest on inbound marketing content that provides the research material your customers are searching for.\nMarketing software can help you manage your inbound marketing strategy.\nMarketing software can help you plan your content, meet deadlines and coordinate your team to develop content that is specific to buyers at each stage of the funnel.\nThe software will also help track engagement and the progression of buyers through the funnel, which helps you create and repurpose content and send the information to the buyer just when they need it most.\nSelecting a channel partner to work with can be hugely valuable in amplifying your message and increasing your reach.

However, it is important to choose a sales channel that suits your business model, and even better if the channel you choose adds value for your potential customer and can help you guide them through the software buying process.\nThere are three common types of channel relationships that SaaS companies can use. Cost, flexibility and market adaptability are three major factors that will determine which channel to choose, and you need to understand which channel relates best to your customers’ requirements. The three sales channels are:\nApplication Developer Model\nThe Application Developer Model is slightly different in that the vendor directly supports the customer and the customer pays the vendor. However, a third party can help the customer set up or customize the vendor’s software. For example, Zoho CRM sells its service directly to customers and customers pay them directly.\nBrokerage Channel Model\nThe Brokerage Channel Model helps customize software for customers. This may entail bundling or stacking software to customize a solution for customers; this method can also include account management. It’s similar to an insurance broker sourcing and building a policy for you and works best for simple SaaS products that focus on high transactional requirements.\nValue Added Reseller (VAR)\nVAR provides customers with a fully customized software service. The reseller builds, operates, services and supports and also invoices the customer. The reseller will then pay a license fee or royalties back to the vendor or in some cases the customer can pay the license fee directly to the vendor.\nFor example, Roketto is a HubSpot Certified Partner, which means that we can sell HubSpot Licenses to our clients. Clients who buy a HubSpot license through Roketto are usually going to work with us for inbound marketing services, and the Hubspot software helps us in our service delivery, marketing strategy and with measuring and tracking results.\nAnd because Roketto is a VAR certified partner with Hubspot, we can provide them with a special link that lets them save money on the regular $3000 onboarding fee.

Organizations that choose a cloud-native RPA solution enjoy many benefits, including intelligent process automation in the cloud with a minimal total cost of ownership (TCO). Cloud RPA frees the organizations from the related costs and time to operate and maintain infrastructure, significantly reducing the time to value.\nCloud deployment also opens the door for an accelerated pace of innovation, which is true of the RPA industry, with more capabilities delivered more frequently than ever before that are pushed directly to the automation environment. And that means dealing with change at an accelerated rate: adding new capabilities or even systems. How good or bad the change experience is, how seamless or disruptive it becomes, depends on the organization’s ability to handle change—whether it has resources and processes in place—and the automation technology provider the organization selects.\nFor the individual user, change is simply a matter of taking what a provider offers when it’s offered and working with the change: enjoying the new capabilities and/or dealing with issues such as a new way of using the solution or handling compatibility challenges. For an enterprise-class organization, that change effect is multiplied by the number of users, business applications within the organization, and the complexity of the solution and business. A disruption caused by change can have a significant effect on an organization’s continuity and bottom line.\nHow does an organization keep up with the pace of change to improve productivity and still provide a stable and non-disruptive automation environment to the different center of excellence (COE) automation leads to keep operations running round the clock? With so much to risk, many organizations have adopted a change management approach to handling updates for ensuring a successful implementation.\nWhat is change management?\nChange management can take many forms. But in terms of technology, according to CIO, it’s “the process for reviewing, approving, testing, and installing a new piece of equipment, a cloud instance, or a new release of an application.”\nIt’s important that an organization have a dedicated team to handle releases and promote the value of change for securing acceptance with users across the enterprise.

But besides the development itself, there’s another important issue that requires close attention. We’re talking about the way of licensing and delivering the software.\nWhen there’s a need to choose what framework, technology, or a programming language should be used during the development process, in most cases, the development company makes the final decision and the customer relies on the developer’s experience and skills. But the chosen software delivery model affects both the customer and the developer because different models have different pros and cons and require different development strategy.\nIn this article, we’ll talk about one of the existing software licensing and delivery models named Software as a Service, or SaaS, to be short, and the key benefits it offers.\nWhat is SaaS?\nSaaS is a centrally hosted software that is provided to a customer in the form of a service on a subscription basis. The applications of such kind run on the servers of SaaS providers and users can access them via browsers. Instead of buying an application, a user pays a “rent” that allows him to use it for a certain amount of time. Thus, users can decrease the use cost, which is one of the primary benefits of using SaaS. There’s no need for a user to think about the technical issues since the SaaS provider takes care of it.\nLet’s continue with the main SaaS advantages and benefits for a customer.\nMain Advantages and Benefits for Customer\nWhen we talk about an application without singling out specific features, we usually mean in-house software, software that was created for using within the organization. In this case, the customer is responsible for the support of hardware, databases, storage, security issues, and other important aspects of successfully running application.

Cloud Strategies can provide an independent assessment of a software company’s SaaS strategy for investors and boards, or work directly with the company to maximize its opportunity for success. Cloud Strategies can work at a high level providing an assessment and recommendations in an advisory role, or become an integral part of the company team to make their SaaS Business Work.\nSaaS Company Profiles\nThe SaaS delivery and business models encompass a very wide variety of types of companies. The SaaS strategy will vary greatly, dependent on five primary characteristics of the SaaS company.\nGreenfield or Established Businesses\nStart-ups have the advantage of a clean slate, but don’t have the resources, image recognition, or channels of established players. Existing software vendors have many advantages, but the transition to SaaS can create competition with their existing products, additional working capital requirements, and issues with their existing channel.\nLow or High Price Offering\nMany basic SaaS products like Dropbox have a base edition that is free and entice their customers to move up to a paid version costing $5 to $10 per user per month. SaaS products vary in price from a few dollars per month for products like QuickBooks Online at around $30 to $60 per month to enterprise products such as NetSuite or Saleforce generally cost around $50 per seat per month with a wide variation up or down depending on the features. Some high-value, specialized SaaS products may cost as much as $600 per month. Services costs add significantly to the total cost of implementation in large, complex systems. The strategies and tactics for these SaaS offerings vary widely based on their price.\nDegree of Services Required\nSimple SaaS products have essentially no setup, or may have a minimum end user configuration such as setting up file locations for Dropbox. SaaS products have “Customer Self-Service” as a key attribute, allowing the company and the user to perform more of the setup operations for moderately complex products such as QuickBooks Online.

But as with all important topics, it isn't easy to get it right. To help you figure I researched pricing for two days. Here are my learnings.\nWe even build a little tool that lets you compare different pricing scenarios. This way you can figure out which pricing is suitable for your business.\nDifferent pricing models\nThe different pricing models I'll cover today aren't mutually exclusive. The most common practice is to combine multiple models together. This way you can build the right bundles for your customers. Something that's done pretty well by Hubspot. They combine users, features & freemiums into packages suitable for every customer. But now let's take a look at what pricing could be suitable for you:\nFlat pricing is pretty straightforward. You pay X amount of money in a certain period. The most common are monthly and yearly. No hidden fees, no strings attached.\nPro: Transparency. The customer knows exactly what to expect. It, therefore, is pretty trustworthy.\nCon: Regardless if a user uses your product 10x as often as another user both pay the same amount of money. Therefore some users will love it while it seems expensive to others.\nUser count is something often used by bigger SaaS companies offering products for entire teams. The logic behind it: The bigger the team the higher the revenue. Something that is the case more times than it’s not. There are two common approaches. Either every new user needs a new license or you go with the team-based approach. Having licences for up to 5 users, 10 users etc.\nPro: Every new customer can add growth to your MRR if they grow themselves. Having implemented the solution already they aren’t super likely to switch.\nCon: Other builders might see this as an opportunity to attract customers with better pricing for their size. Also, every license-based SaaS has seen accounts with only one user that is actually 2 or more people. It can be an annoyance to teams with some users who barely have to use the software but still need an account.\nCharging based on features is something for very diverse SaaS products. As with user count pricing models it’s often used by large players.

Finally, for SaaS products that are not fully configurable, or for very complex operations, some customization may be required in modules that interface to SaaS products.\nSaaS sales models vary widely, but all are more internet focused. Freemium models are common for low cost products which can provide a base level of functionality at no cost, ideally paid for by advertising revenue. The intent is to provide sufficient value to “up-sell” to the paid version, typically costing $10 or less per month. These SaaS products are sold by “no-touch” internet sales and marketing. Products that are somewhat higher priced rely on internet marketing supported sales with the potential for online chat. Enterprise SaaS products are sold directly or through a channel, due to their complexity and likely services component. These Enterprise SaaS products are heavily supported by internet marketing which helps educate the customer and reduce the direct sales costs.\nStrategies vary greatly depending on the horizontal or vertical market served. Different markets have differing propensities to move to SaaS and different competitive landscapes. Generally SMB markets have a greater demand for SaaS with the desire to reduce in-house IT complexity, a reduced need for customization, and reduced integration requirements. Certain vertical markets such as medical and financial have greater security, up-time, and compliance requirements which may increase the time to move to a SaaS solution. Consumers are now very comfortable with “applications in the cloud”, and do not have a “switching cost” from current applications. Consumer markets are most cost conscious and can be highly competitive.

That's an exaggeration, but today's savvy ISOs are negotiating agent relationships with value added resellers (VARs) or independent software vendors (ISVs). In this article, I'll highlight some of the legal issues around these relationships, which are becoming central to the ISO business.\nSo what is a VAR or ISV anyway? There is no official industry definition of these terms, but in plain language, VARs and ISVs already sell something to merchants who might have merchant accounts with ISOs.\nAs an example, consider a dentist practice management software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider that has a portfolio of a few hundred dental clinics. Through its SaaS, this ISV helps dentists maintain client records, set appointments, communicate with patients and create invoices. This ISV may see value in adding payments to its own offerings or at least in integrating to the payment services of a given processor or ISO.\nOnce that integration is technically possible, the ISV can easily solicit its dentists to offer them payments with the unparalleled convenience of the payment services working hand-in-glove (pun intended) with the SaaS dentist platform. From the point of view of the ISO, this ISV adds value to the resale of merchant services, and they are therefore a value-added reseller (VAR).\nIt's best not to get hung up on jargon, because it often changes, and different people will understand jargon to have different meanings. It's perhaps best to understand the roles of the various parties and use acronyms that they like to use for themselves.\nTwo factors drive ISVs and VARs to also want to sell processing: profit and competition.\nThe profit incentive is straightforward, as payment processing gives them a chance to participate in an entirely new revenue stream that is separate from their original business objectives. The ISV/VAR looks at their merchant customers the way others do: as sources of revenue with an associated cost of acquisition.\nAdding payments to an existing portfolio has a relatively low cost of acquisition for both the ISV/VAR and the processor behind it. In fact, in the contemporary landscape it probably costs more—from the supply side and also the merchant's purchasing side—to procure payments in a way that is not integrated with the merchant's core operating platform.\nCompetition as a motivator is more complex.", "score": 0.01095141083145412, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:2a321bae-505f-42c5-a8d5-09659ed00186>", "text": "Our SaaS development company offers the most reasonable price for high-quality SaaS development services.

Many of the apartments also benefited from running water and electricity, and could be lived in, if so desired.\nAlfred Hitchcock – Rear Window\nHaving created the world of Rear Window in line with real world architecture, for Hitchcock to then invert the rules of how architecture is used in the real world throws the audience.

Analytical Essay of Rear Window Rear Window is a classic movie, directed by Alfred Hitchcock, about human curiosity, voyeurism and murder.\nThe greatest in this experimental period was, of course, Rear Window.

We move among it, inhabit it; it’s our beehive, our bird’s nest and so it becomes largely invisible to many of us. And yet, in the cinematic world the opposite seems true. We marvel, we run, we creep with our heroes and villains, through architectural landscapes.\nThink of the wondrous scenes that take place in Hogwarts (Harry Potter 1-8) or the playful ones in the eponymous setting of The Grand Budapest Hotel. Now think of how many times you felt a creeping sense of fear as Danny peddled his trike through the empty corridors of the Overlook Hotel in The Shining, or Captain Dallas squeezing himself along the claustrophobic air ducts of the Nostromo in Alien. Through these few examples it is clear that the surroundings of our characters, as well as their predicaments, help shape our emotional response.\nWes Anderson – Grand Budapest Hotel\nArchitecture also drives plot. In Christopher Nolan’s Inception architecture literally and figuratively divides the characters; the action is split thematically into different maze like structures, or levels, that are built within the plot by an architect: the characters navigate between them, moving forward towards a common goal, some getting lost along the way.", "score": 0.836702347, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:65bec348-4869-4029-bf2f-a5736708f174>", "text": "The result is an unnatural starkness that indicates something is hidden. Back lighting and fill lighting are kept to a minimum, resulting in sharp, angular shadows cast ominously on the wall and ceiling above Norman.\nHitchcock also deftly uses camera angles to reveal all the audience needs to know about the troubled mind of Norman Bates. As he did with the lighting, Hitchcock shapes the scene in terms of contrasts. We see Marion sitting comfortably in her chair, leaning slightly forward, enjoying a sandwich Norman has made for her. Hitchcock places the camera near eye level so the audience sees Marion as two people might see each other while sitting and talking. There is nothing unusual in this. In fact, this particular angle provides the audience with a sense of normalcy and comfort in Marion's presence. Hitchcock, however, moves out of the comfort zone to shoot Norman from an unnaturally low perspective. These two camera angles in-and-of themselves mean nothing. Only when they are juxtaposed can any meaning be taken. The shift to Norman's angle suggests that Norman's world is skewed, off balance, out of kilter. We feel uncomfortable in this position because we are not used to viewing the world from such an angle and to do so makes it difficult to extract meaning.\nIn Norman's parlor, we usually see Marion from the front, so her full face is in view.\nHowever, the camera frequently moves to the left side of Norman, obscuring his other side.\nHitchcock's mise-en-scene probably does more to capture the intent of the characters than any one element in the entire scene. It also emphasizes the duality that exists not only within Norman Bates but within all of us. For instance, Marion is surrounded by scenic details that make her a sympathetic character, not without flaw--after all, she did steal forty thousand dollars-- but certainly not one to condemn too harshly. She sits at ease in her chair. In front of her is a tray with a small meal prepared by Norman. On the tray is a pitcher of milk--not just a glass but an entire pitcher. The detail has less to do with the quantity of milk (Marion, in fact, drinks none of it) as it does with the pitcher itself. This pitcher is white and has soft, graceful lines that suggest Marion's essential goodness.", "score": 0.829279482, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:54d9e538-9c02-4e46-9c94-2388a85a6def>", "text": "First, before I get into my main topic, I just have to say that this film reminded me that Grace Kelly was one of the most beautiful actresses of her time. Thank you to Alfred Hitchcock for providing such wonder visions of her in “Rear Window”. Now, back to the topic at hand.\nGoing to the movies and watching a film is, at its very heart, a voyeuristic activity. We sit and watch other people’s lives and stories from afar framed by the screen and form opinions and cast judgements on what we are watching. Alfred Hitchcock throws that voyeurism in our faces with “Rear Window”.\n“Rear Window” is a great example of what a master director with a master editor can accomplish. We watch a mostly point-of-view presentation of how a story is created in one’s mind and how that story can infect others that surround a character. We watch as L.B. Jefferies, confined to his wheelchair, becomes involved in the other lives of his neighbors as he voyeuristically watches their lives unfold, framed by the windows of their apartments.\nWe watch “Jeff” as he watches his neighbors and we become consumed by what he is seeing through classic A-B-A editing. A: We see him watching something. B: We cut to see what he is seeing. A: We cut back to get his reaction to what he is seeing. As the Bordwell reading stated, “the Kuleshov effect operates here: Our mind connects the two parts of space”, Jeff’s apartment and the courtyard, without the use of an establishing shot. This sequence of cuts is repeated over and over again to develop the movie-like story of his neighbors where he forms his opinions and casts judgements on what he is seeing and hearing. Given the lack of details, he fills in the gaps by coming to his own conclusions based purely on his visual input from afar. This is the Kuleshov effect on the part of Jeff himself. He connects the dots in his own mind based simply on what he sees and hears while he watches the movie of his neighbors unfold.\nFor me, “Rear Window” was a film of a man watching a movie of his neighbors. Each window in the courtyard presents a screen for us to voyeuristically watch as Jeff also voyeuristically watches his neighbors progress through their everyday lives and, oh yes, commits murder.", "score": 0.829186916, "source": "dense"}]}

Alfred Hitchcock’s psycho was first screened in 1960, where it instantly became a box- office success, and one of the most influential horror movies of all time, showing explicit violent and sexual scenes which shocked audiences worldwide, and breaking new ground for mainstream Hollywood film.\nIt transformed Hitchcock into a prestigious film director and the ‘mother’ of horror films. Its themes stuck at many American morals and were even blamed for causing severe murders, creating concerns of connections between screen violence and anti-social behaviour, which is still debated to this day.Alfred Hitchcock uses duality from the very opening seconds of the film, to reflect the whole theme of the film, of a split double personality.\nHitchcock’s idea of the black and white contrast, which was originally thought of to reduce the costs, also added to the duality of the film. This also went well with the chillingly screeching music which had a sharp staccato rhythm and slashing strings which created contrast and also added to the tension, suspense and intrigue in the shower scene, the slashing and screaming of Marion. The credits are also split and formed to merge into one whole ‘person’ portraying the duality of the characters in Psycho.\nHitchcock makes use of camera angles, which is effectively shown when Marion is in the car, running away from her fear. The camera is focused through her eyes and shows her looking away from her own reflection as the mirror, which mirrors her dual personality; another effective technique that Hitchcock uses to present the theme of duality in Marion. Norman Bates’ face is almost half covered most of time by the darkness and camera angles which Hitchcock uses, to portray the split personality in Norman Bates, which is his mother. Only at the closing stages of the story, do the audience realize that Bates has two distinct identities, himself and his mother, and that the two personality are continually fighting over the little sanity that is left in Norman Bates, which Bates reveals when dressing as his mother. The mirrors in the motel also work effectively reflecting Norman Bates’ image to show the dual personality in Norman.The language used in psycho also allows Hitchcock to play with the audiences’ assumption of the split personality e.g.\nWhen Norman says: ‘We all go a little mad sometimes.’ Hitchcock uses the theme of predator versus prey to build upon the audiences fear towards Bates.", "score": 0.826190948, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:cdf85bba-d358-4bd4-9891-93111acb7412>", "text": "Marion’s eyes study the furniture of the room. Stuffed birds make up most of the furniture. Hitchcock often used birds as symbols. Most famously in “The Birds” where at the beginning of the picture we witness birds trapped in their cages. By the end of the film it’s the other way around with humans trapped in a house and the birds outside. The purpose of stuffed birds in “Psycho” has been interpreted several times. Norman explains that stuffing birds is his hobby; we later learn that he stuffed his own mother. One of the birds is an owl waving her wings symbolizing the furious side of his split personality (or his mother side); the calm crow is his calmer side (Norman side), or maybe they’re just there to disturb the viewer and place them in an uncomfortable surrounding.\nAfter learning more about Norman’s taxidermy hobby, the conversation takes us deeper into his personality. Taxidermy is supposed to “pass the time not fill it” I can imagine the work, stuffing birds, and his own mother over and over using expensive chemicals. Poor Norman. One of the most disturbing lines follows expressing the oddness of this disturbed character: “Well, a boy’s best friend is his mother.” Moments later, Norman asks Marion where she’s heading. “I didn’t mean to pry”, he utters apologetically. Another humorous line, for Norman does pry in the scene that follows, not verbally though; he does it physically through a peephole.\nDuring the course of this scene, the viewer is exposed to Psycho’s finest moment, a priceless exchange of dialogue. Through their connection we slowly remove our feet from Marion’s shoes and step into Norman’s shoes. The focus now is on Norman and his mother. After, Norman expressing the courses of his daily life with no friends and him putting up with his mother, Marion suggests he send her to a madhouse. A medium shot of Norman changes to a close up, not through a cut but by him moving forward to face the lens. He snaps at her. “We all go a little mad sometimes.”\nAt the end of the scene we learn that Marion changes her mind and decides to return the money the next morning.

With Wasserman's help, Hitchcock not only received tremendous creative freedom from the studios, but with Paramount's profit-sharing contract, Hitchcock received substantive financial rewards as well.\nThree very popular films, all starring Grace Kelly, followed. Dial M for Murder (1954) was adapted from the popular stage play by Frederick Knott. This was originally another experimental film, with Hitchcock using the technique of 3D cinematography, although the film was apparently never released in this format at first; it did receive screenings in the early 1980s in 3D form. Rear Window starred James Stewart again, as well as Thelma Ritter and Raymond Burr. Here, the wheelchair-bound Stewart observes the movements of his neighbours across the courtyard and becomes convinced one of them has murdered his wife. Like Lifeboat and Rope, the movie was photographed almost entirely within the confines of a small space: Stewart's tiny studio apartment overlooking the massive courtyard set. To Catch a Thief, set in the French Riviera, starred Kelly and Cary Grant.\n1958's Vertigo again starred Stewart, this time with Kim Novak and Barbara Bel Geddes. The film was a commercial failure, but has come to be viewed by many as one of Hitchcock's masterpieces.\nHitchcock followed Vertigo with three very different films, which were all massive commercial successes.", "score": 0.01101714823745269, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:17ca49b1-97f3-49f0-8ffb-82ddd8fb5261>", "text": "Installation Instructions for Solar Shades\nRollEase Roller Shade - Installation Instructions\n1.

In 1871, Germany officially became a unified country. This time, we’ll look at the cultural ramifications of the unification and how it impacted art.\nAlthough German-speaking princes had been allied for centuries, the individual provinces needed to strengthen their commitment in order to counter military and economic competition from other countries such as Austria and France. But just because the people in the new country spoke German and shared much in the way of their cultural identity didn’t mean that they felt like a big happy family. And the disruptive forces of the industrial revolution did nothing to help the sense of confusion and frustration.\nThe people of the German Empire needed to ask themselves: what does it mean to be German? The imagery on Mettlach steins of the time offers some interesting answers to that question.\nSome steins use inspiration from the distant past for their subject matter. This shows a pride in the traditions of German culture—with roots back to the middle ages—as well as nostalgia for a simpler time. This past is often called “altdeutschen” or “old Germany”. When it appears in art, it is called historicism.\nFor instance, at the beginning of this post is a beautiful stein that shows a medieval knight mounted on a majestic white horse enjoying a tankard of beer. The romantic notion of the past is echoed in the lid in the shape of a castle turret.\nThis large-scale pitcher shows successful German hunters in extravagant Renaissance dress—just look at that ermine trim! The man on this side is toasted by none other than the ancient goddess of the hunt, Diana, who sits on top of a beer barrel.\nA noble couple in elegant dress from the 16th century is featured on this pitcher. The traditions of the past are celebrated by the man who is practicing falconry, using the bird of prey to hunt.\nHistoricism is not the only way that steins reveal the German exploration of identity. National symbolism can be seen in this Mettlach stein. The Imperial Eagle of Germany is front and center.\nThere is further pride in German modernity: This stein celebrates two very important technological developments that Germany embraced: the telegraph and the railroad.

Instead, over its long past, what is now known as Germany was once states, principalities, kingdoms and more. With its often divided presence, many people tried to unite the country, including Charlemagne of the Holy Roman Empire. In the 9th century, Charlemagne was successful in ruling over a large territory that included modern day Germany, yet it was not strong enough to last and within a single generation, the power of the territory was merely symbolic.\nThe 14th century proved disastrous not only for a fragmented Germany but for all of Europe. Wars and the Black Plague wiped out between 30-60% of the continent’s population. In the 15th century, the Habsburgs were successful in securing a hold on the Holy Roman Emperor which would last into the 19th century. Unfortunately the empire’s various territories were constantly at odds with each other thus preventing the unity that had occurred in France and England.\nThe Reformation, an incredibly important period in European history, was born in Germany when Martin Luther posted his 95 Theses to the town square. Luther hoped to highlight corruption in the Catholic Church and as a result, his desire for change sparked the Reformation that spread quickly across the continent. The next two centuries witnessed the Scientific Revolution and many great thinkers emerged from Germany like Nicholas Copernicus and Johannes Kepler.\nThe 19th century was a time of change for Germany as the desire for unification grew. Tired of several states, each with their own ruler and even currency, much of the population sought nationhood. The March Revolution erupted in 1848 but was ultimately unsuccessful as King Friedrich Wilhelm VI rejected a united nation because it would threaten his power. However, unification was inevitable and occurred more than two decades later in 1871, after the Franco-Prussian war. This unification was ushered in by Otto von Bismarck who helped to maintain peace in Europe until 1914.\nThe First World War was a massive conflict from 1914 to 1918 between the Allies (Britain, France and Russia) and the Central Powers (Germany and Austria-Hungary).

Our immune system produces antibodies to fight against unwanted substances that are harmful for us. During an allergy, the body produces antibodies to fight off against substances that do not cause harm. This immune system reaction can trigger conditions such as inflammation of skin, nasal passages or the digestive system. This can be termed as an allergic reaction.\nIf the allergic reaction becomes severe enough to induce life threatening symptoms then it is referred to as an Anaphylaxis. During this condition a person experiences severe allergic reactions and if not treated in time, it may even result in death.\nA study has shown that women commonly, experience more severe allergic reactions than men owing to their estrogen hormones.\nStudies pertaining to anaphylaxis are difficult to perform because of its life threatening nature. About 200 people die from anaphylaxis every year in the United States, but these numbers could be bigger, because many people die from unrecognized anaphylaxis. A person may be suffering from heart disease and may die because of a heart attack, but it’s also possible that the attack may well have been induced by a severe allergic reaction.\nResearchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID have found that female mice are more prone to more severe anaphylactic reactions as compared to their male counterparts. They discovered that estradiol, which is an estrogen, enhances the activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), which produces some of the common symptoms that are attributed to anaphylaxis.\nOnly when plain eNOS is introduced into the system of the person undergoing anaphylaxis will result in the drop of blood pressure of the person, enabling the fluid in the blood vessels to leak into the surrounding tissue, which would in turn cause swelling. Adding estradiol would further cause the symptoms to become more pronounced than ever.\nResearchers in a bid to understand that whether estradiol was the real culprit blocked the estrogen in female mice. And the results showed that female mice experienced similar levels of allergic reactions as their male counterparts, thereby further strengthening the research.\nSo overall, the research concluded that gender factor does play an important role in allergies.\n“More women are admitted to hospitals for anaphylaxis as compared to men which indicates that something is going on here.

I think there are some women who would rather eat a worm than be compared to men. On the other end of that pole are those who gladly acknowledge the distinct strengths and weaknesses of both sexes and are grateful for the comparison. It’s likely that most of us with two X chromosomes fall somewhere in between the two extremes.\nAs far as our life experiences, I believe that a woman’s is not so different from a man’s in terms of the actual things that happen: love, marriage, children, death, career, friendship, education, etc.. It’s far more likely that the variance comes from the way we each react to a particular scenario. For example: it’s far more likely that a woman will show her emotions while experiencing a traumatic or an extremely joyful event. And though it’s perfectly acceptable for both sexes to do this, you just don’t see very many men tearing up when they watch their best friend get married. The thing is, these differences are hard-wired into our dna. Men have been the hunters and protectors since the beginning; of necessity they are less reactive to stressful situations. I mean, what if back then when the guys had to go find food they suddenly started crying hysterically when a big scary bear jumped out in front of them instead of killing it? I’m just saying…\nAnd, since I’m using hypothetical situations, here’s one starring a woman. What if back then when a woman had to give birth on her own, take care of that newborn without the help of Dr. Spock or new mommy blogs, suddenly just left the baby because she didn’t feel a connection with her? Not good… Sadly, this tragedy does happen. Thankfully, it’s not often.\nThe point to all this is just to be aware of our differences, especially when you’re trying to communicate to the opposite sex. I’m not just talking love relationships here. We have fathers, brothers, sons, male friends, co-workers, and clients. Men will always be different from women.

Ribbons and curls tend to be more in line of what is expected of them, but writing in the US journal Social Science & Medicine, Dr Sharyn Clough, from the Department of Philosophy at Oregon State University puts forward the view that this emphasis on cleanliness may contribute to higher rates of certain diseases in adult women.\nThere is a well-documented link between increased hygiene and sanitation and higher rates of asthma, allergies and autoimmune disorders that is known as ''hygiene hypothesis''. Dr Clough points out that women have higher rates in all of these disorders and she thinks she knows the reason why.\n''Girls,'' she says, ''tend to be dressed more in clothing that is not supposed to get dirty, they tend to play indoors more than boys and their playtime is more often supervised by parents. As a result girls stay cleaner.'' She points out that there is a significant difference in the types and amounts of germs that boys and girls are exposed to, leading her to the view that this might explain some of the health differences between men and women.\nDr Clough proposes that there should be new ways of looking at old studies. The ''hygiene hypothesis'' has linked the recent rise in asthma, allergies and autoimmune disorders such as Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis with particular geographical and environmental locations. Many studies have noted that as countries become industrialised and more urban, rates of these diseases rise. A good example is India, where rates of Crohn's disease are climbing as sanitation improves and industrialisation increases.\nIn the United States it is reported that asthma prevalence is 8.9% in females as opposed to 6.5% in males and autoimmune diseases strike three times as many women as men.

C.\nPublic Library of Science\n1 - 12\nItem Usage Stats\nMetadataShow full item record\nBackground: Autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) are characterized by a strong genetic susceptibility from the Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) locus. Additionally, disorders of epigenetic processes, in particular non-random X chromosome inactivation (XCI), have been reported in many female-predominant autoimmune diseases. Here we test the hypothesis that women with RA or SSc who are strongly genetically predisposed are less susceptible to XCI bias. Methods: Using methylation sensitive genotyping of the androgen receptor (AR) gene, XCI profiles were performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 161 women with RA, 96 women with SSc and 100 healthy women. HLA-DRB1 and DQB1 were genotyped. Presence of specific autoantibodies was documented for patients. XCI skewing was defined as having a ratio ≥ 80:20 of cells inactivating the same X chromosome. Results: 110 women with RA, 68 women with SSc, and 69 controls were informative for the AR polymorphism. Among them 40.9% of RA patients and 36.8% of SSc patients had skewed XCI compared to 17.4% of healthy women (P = 0.002 and 0.018, respectively). Presence of RA-susceptibility alleles coding for the \"shared epitope\" correlated with higher skewing among RA patients (P = 0.002) and such correlation was not observed in other women, healthy or with SSc. Presence of SSc-susceptibility alleles did not correlate with XCI patterns among SSc patients. Conclusion: Data demonstrate XCI skewing in both RA and SSc compared to healthy women. Unexpectedly, skewed XCI occurs more often in women with RA carrying the shared epitope, which usually reflects severe disease.", "score": 0.18667204378341284, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:179fdc52-0be0-484b-a537-5c561f92b8f8>", "text": "Hypothyroidism And Autoimmune Disease - Is Als An Autoimmune Disease\nRealize that you can most likely experience a normal life without depression, pain, and fatigue.

The link between increased hygiene and sanitation and higher rates of asthma, allergies and autoimmune disorders is known as the \"hygiene hypothesis\" and the link is well-documented. Yet the role of gender is rarely explored as part of this phenomenon.\nOregon State University philosopher Sharyn Clough thinks researchers need to dig deeper. In her new study, published in the journal Social Science & Medicine, she points out that women have higher rates of allergies and asthma, and many autoimmune disorders. However, there is no agreed-upon explanation for these patterns. Clough offers a new explanation.\nClough documents a variety of sociological and anthropological research showing that our society socializes young girls differently from young boys. In particular, she notes, girls are generally kept from getting dirty compared to boys.\n\"Girls tend to be dressed more in clothing that is not supposed to get dirty, girls tend to play indoors more than boys, and girls playtime is more often supervised by parents,\" said Clough, adding that this is likely to result in girls staying cleaner. \"There is a significant difference in the types and amounts of germs that girls and boys are exposed to, and this might explain some of the health differences we find between women and men.\"\nHowever, that doesnt mean that parents should let their daughters go out into the back yard and eat dirt, Clough points out. \"What I am proposing is new ways of looking at old studies,\" she said. \"The hygiene hypothesis is well-supported, but what I am hoping is that the epidemiologists and clinicians go back and examine their data through the lens of gender.\"\nThe \"hygiene hypothesis\" links the recent rise in incidence of asthma, allergies, and autoimmune disorders such as Crohns disease and rheumatoid arthritis, with particular geographical and environmental locations, in particular urban, industrialized nations.

At least 15 diseases are known to be the direct result of an autoimmune response, while circumstantial evidence implicates >80 conditions with autoimmunity . In several instances, such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, and myocarditis, the autoimmune disease can be induced experimentally by administering self-antigen in the presence of adjuvant (collagen, myelin basic protein, and cardiac myosin, respectively) .

Conservative estimates indicate that 6.7 million or 78.8% of the persons with autoimmune diseases are women .|\nSoon after autoimmune diseases were first recognized more than a century ago, researchers began to associate them with viral and bacterial infections. Autoimmune diseases tend to cluster in families and in individuals (a person with one autoimmune disease is more likely to get another), which indicates that common mechanisms are involved in disease susceptibility. Studies of the prevalence of autoimmune disease in monozygotic twins show that genetic as well as environmental factors (such as infection) are necessary for the disease to develop. Genetic factors are important in the development of autoimmune disease, since such diseases develop in certain strains of mice (e.g., systemic lupus erythematosus or lupus in MRL mice) without any apparent infectious environmental trigger. However, a body of circumstantial evidence links diabetes, multiple sclerosis, myocarditis, and many other autoimmune diseases with preceding infections . More often, many different microorganisms have been associated with a single autoimmune disease, which indicates that more than one infectious agent can induce the same disease through similar mechanisms .

It can be done by replacing the entire battery or just a few of its cells with brand-new ones, depending upon how much it has actually been used.\nThe procedure includes cleaning the battery terminals, eliminating any corrosion, re-calibrating the battery if essential, testing the battery for performance and after that setting up the brand-new cells in location of the old ones.\nHow do I know when my battery needs reconditioning?\nIf you are experiencing poor efficiency from your battery, the first indication that your battery might require reconditioning is. It might indicate that one or more of your batteries have actually lost their ability to hold a charge if this happens.\nThis issue usually happens after years of usage, however it can likewise take place rapidly due to a number of elements consisting of:\n- Excessive heat\n- Poor ventilation\n- Excessive cold\nIt will no longer offer power to your car’s electronic systems if your battery does not hold a charge anymore. Your engine computer, lights, radio, a/c, and so on, will all stop working till the battery is replaced. You need to constantly check your owner’s manual before attempting to change your battery.\nWhy would my battery requirement to be reconditioned?\nA battery that has actually been sitting unused for extended periods of time can lose approximately 50% of its original capability with time. When this occurs, it becomes less able to save energy and deliver it to your vehicle’ s electrical parts.\nExamining If Your Battery Has Gone Bad\nThe first step is to determine why your battery has spoiled. If your battery was recently replaced, examine the warranty duration.", "score": 0.83466953, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:4828e3a0-d60e-4bca-a351-8ca767661bf6>", "text": "Unknown.

Freezing temperatures, the extra use of lights, defrosters and wiper all reduce your battery’s engine cranking power. These scenarios combined with older batteries (over 3 years of age) can leave you stuck.\nIn today’s world, European-engineered vehicles require a battery to work harder than they did 20 years ago. Most vehicles on the road today include features like key-less entry, key-less start, lane-assist, adaptive cruise control, and multi-media interface systems which create high-demand energy situations. Then, consider that late model Euros have more advance fuel-systems and integrated, networked computer and control systems that require a battery to maintain reserve power during extreme temperatures and other high electrical load situations.\nYou should take the above referenced factors into consideration when purchasing a battery for your vehicle.

The average car battery can last between 3-5 years, but the actual life of your battery depends on several factors.\n- The quality of the battery when first purchased. You don’t have to spend a fortune, but don’t be cheap about it.\n- How well you maintain it. Battery maintenance goes a long way toward longer life. Include your battery on your checklist whenever you take your car in for routine check ups. Don’t forget the cables and terminals and keep them clean.\n- The weather. Check the top of your battery to see the temperature specifications. If you live in a cold climate make sure you purchase one intended for your area. Cold weather reduces the cranking power of your battery so an older battery will experience more issues in the winter than a new one. Car batteries can even freeze and explode so if you think your battery is frozen proceed with caution.\n- Your car usage. Turn off all your car’s accessories before you turn off your car. The heater and A/C, radio, wipers, etc. can really drain your battery even when the car is off. Even consistently short trips can shorten battery life.\nAnd since it’s still the middle of winter we’ll pass on some more battery tips from our friends at AAA:\n- Turn off all accessories at night before turning the ignition switch off.\n- Make sure battery case and brackets are free of corrosion.\n- Keep the car in a garage overnight, if available.\n- Check the tension and condition of your fan belt. If it is loose, it can affect the battery’s ability to recharge.\n- Watch and listen for battery-drain warning signs. If headlights dim when idling but brighten when you rev the engine it could signal an electrical system problem. If you hear a grinding or clicking when you turn the ignition to the crank position, your battery may be weak\n- Lastly, if your battery does not initially turn the engine over on the first try in the morning, turn the ignition key on and wait one minute before cranking the engine again. This gives the battery chemicals time to jell and energize the battery terminals.\nIf you’re wondering if your battery is on its last legs bring your car into Sallas Auto Repair and we’ll be happy to check it as well as your car’s other systems.

They don't require an adapter plate, and the identical stud pattern means you don't have to fill old holes and drill new ones. To convert older style manual winches to power, please contact Harken.\nGeneral Radial® Information\nHow to I find the serial number on my Radial winch?\nThe serial number should be apparent when you take off the drum. It is on the drum support, just below the lower red roller-bearing cage.\nDo all winches have part numbers?\nNo, only the Radial and Performa™ lines, which includes the electric, hydraulic, UniPower, and Rewind models.\nWhy is the drum narrower at the bottom?\nThis shape combined with the surface grip keeps the line low on the drum, providing efficient and trouble-free operation.\nHow much electricity do electric winches use?\nAlthough electric winches can consume as much as 150 to 200 amps, they do not run for long periods of time. A day's use might amount to no more than 10 minutes. Many sailors measure the amp-hours used for each electrical device, calculate their total electrical needs, and match this to battery capacity.\nHow do winches of different speeds affect battery drain?\nA Harken 2-speed winch drains less power from the battery because it offers the mechanical advantage of a second gear. A single-speed winch operates in the motor's upper range and draws more amps. Because line speed slows dramatically in the upper range, time of use is comparable to 2-speed, but amperage draw is greater.\nHow do I determine my battery requirements?\nCalculate the amount of electricity you need for all systems per charging period. Compare this number to your battery capacity. For optimal battery life and performance, your battery capacity should be three times the daily draw. For example, if electrical draw is 100 amp-hours per day, you will need 300 amp-hours of battery capacity.\nWhat is an amp-hour?", "score": 0.005339425852301788, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:22b1269a-dfb4-4548-b848-6c97bb17cf67>", "text": "In our article discussing Ah (ampere-hours) and Wh (watt-hours), we got a ton of questions about the longevity of batteries. The question “How long does a battery last?” was a predominant one. To help everybody trying to calculate how long will a battery last, we have created a Battery Life Calculator.\nIt’s quite useful knowing when a battery will die on us. Example: If we go camping and depend on batteries for all our power needs, and we have no other means of generating electricity.\nBefore we check out the Battery Life Calculator, let’s note that figuring out how long will a battery last is pretty simple in theory (in practice, it’s actually quite difficult). We use this equation for battery drain time:\nBattery Life (in hours) = Battery Capacity (in Ah) / Load Current (in A)\nWhat does ah mean on a battery? It just means amp-hours. 1 Ah is a current of 1 amp running for 1 hour.\nExample: How long will a 100 Ah (amp-hour) battery last if we hook it up to a 1 Ah electric device? Well, battery capacity = 100 Ah, load current = 1 A, thus such a battery will last for 100 Ah / 1 A = 100 hours.\nBasically, a 100 Ah battery means that such a battery can provide 100 A of current for 1 hour. It can also provide 1 A current for 100 hours. Or 0.1 A or 100 mA for 1000 hours.\nIt seems quite simple, right?\nIf you have 100 capacity units (100 Ah) and you connect it to a device that requires 1 capacity unit (1 A) every hour, it will drain the battery in precisely 100 hours.\nWhy Calculating The Battery Life Is Not Exactly Easy\nHere’s the deal:\nIn practice, we only need two numbers to calculate when the battery will die on us. These are:\n- Battery capacity (in Ah). This one is pretty easy to get; it’s written right on the battery. Typical AA battery has 2.5 Ah or 2500 mAh (milli-amp-hours) capacity, AAA battery has 1 Ah capacity, laptop battery has 2 Ah to 6 Ah, 100 Ah battery has Ah capacity, and so on.

Remote control toys, Wii remotes, laser pointers (well, that is for me), flash lights, even Nerf guns. For me, I have found the best place to pick up batteries is at one of these \"dollar\" stores. Sure the batteries are cheaper, but are they any good? Who knows. Let's find out.\nThe first way to look at the quality of a battery is to see how much stored energy is in it. How could you measure this? Well, here is how I did it. I took a battery and connected to a light bulb and let it run for as long as it could. Like this:\nWith this setup, I can measure both the current ( I ) from the battery and the electric potential ( ΔV ) across the battery. At any given instant in time, the power from the battery will be:\nPower tells me how fast the energy is changing, but not the total energy in the battery. In order to find the total energy, I can write the power like this:\nIf the current and the change in potential were constant for the whole time interval (Δt), this would be a fairly straightforward calculation. Alas, these are not constant. So what do I do? I cheat. If I instead look at a very short time interval, the current and potential do not really change too much. This means that I can reasonably calculate the energy during this short time. Then I just need to do this a whole bunch of times to get the total energy.\nAdding up a whole bunch of small pieces is called \"an integral\". In this case, I won't use calculus to evaluate an integral since I don't know a mathematical function for the power. Instead I will do it numerically with the following formula (by \"I will do\" I really mean \"make a computer do\"):\nAnd that is it. The total energy that the battery produced.\nVernier makes both a current and voltage probe for the LabQuest system. Collecting data was fairly simple (even though each battery would take quite some time).

How many hours of power will your trolling motor have per battery charge?\nUnfortunately, the simplest answer to this question is, it depends. Every battery and trolling motor is slightly different, and there are many different variables that may influence how long your battery is going to last.\nBecause of these variables, the same battery may run your trolling motor for a given amount of time on one boating trip and for a completely different amount of time on another trip.\nLet’s take a closer look at these variables.\nWhat Factors Impact the Run Time of a Marine Battery on a Trolling Motor?\nOne of the most important numbers when figuring battery run time is the amp hours, or Ah. This number should be given on all marine batteries. It denotes the amount of amperage the battery could supply over a given time period.\nFor example, let’s consider a marine battery with a 100Ah rating. Fully charged, and under perfect conditions, this battery could supply your trolling motor 100 amps of power for one hour, 50 amps for 2 hours, 25 amps for 4 hours, 10 amps for 10 hours, etc.\nAs you can see from the example above, how long the battery lasts depends on how many amps your trolling motor is consistently drawing from the battery. The lower the amp draw, the longer the battery will last.\nMarine batteries come with different amp hour ratings. Some have 50Ah or 75Ah ratings, many have 100Ah or 120Ah ratings, and some even have 200Ah ratings.", "score": 0.0012779076971516463, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:22b1269a-dfb4-4548-b848-6c97bb17cf67>", "text": "We have that; it’s 200 Ah.\n- Amp draw. That we don’t have; we have to calculate it.\nTo calculate amp draw (A) from watts (W), we also need to know the voltage (V). To calculate amps, we use the basic electric power equation:\nP (in W) = I (in A) * V (in V)\nBasically, electric power P (wattage) is calculated by multiplying electric current I (amps) with voltage V (volts). To calculate amps, you have to express the electric current I (amps) like this:\nI (in A) = P (in W) / V (in V)\nThis basically tells us that we get the amps by dividing watts by volts.\nExample: We have an 800 W AC unit that runs on a 120 V electric circuit. What’s the amp draw here? Easy, we just divide 800 W by 120 V and get 800W/120V = 6.67 A.\nIf you find this confusing a bit, you can use our watts to amps calculator here to help you out with the calculation.\nIn our example above, we have calculated the amp draw of the 800 W AC. It’s 6.67 A. Now we have both numbers; we have a 200 Ah battery and we know the AC has a 6.67 A draw. How long will a 200 Ah battery last if it has to power this AC? Let’s calculate:\n200 Ah Battery Life = 200 Ah / 6.67 A = 30 hours\nIn short, a 200 Ah battery will be able to power an 800 W 120 V air conditioner for about 30 hours.\nNow, it’s important that we feel the effect of different voltages. Let’s say that we have the same 200 Ah battery, the same power input 800 W unit, but it runs on a 240 V electrical circuit instead of a 120 V circuit.\nBecause the voltage is different, the amp draw – the amps required to run such an AC – will also change.", "score": 0.0008834788988426276, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:06ff274d-a810-4246-8d11-01aae0f3c26a>", "text": "- Can a solar panel overcharge a battery?\n- How long will a 100ah battery run a fridge?\n- How long will it take a 100 watt solar panel to charge a battery?\n- Where does solar go when batteries are full?\n- Do solar panels drain batteries at night?\n- What can I power with a 200 watt solar panel?\n- How much power can a 200 watt solar panel produce?\n- How fast will a 200 watt solar panel charge a 12-volt battery?\n- How long will a 200Ah battery last?\n- How many batteries do I need for 10000 watts?\n- What size solar panel do I need to charge a 12 volt battery?\n- Can you leave a solar trickle charger on all the time?\n- How many batteries do I need for a 2000 watt inverter?\n- How many solar panels and batteries do I need to run a refrigerator?\n- How many batteries is 5000 watts?\n- How many 12V batteries are needed to power a house?\n- How many solar panels do I need to run a TV?\n- How long will a 200W solar panel take to charge a battery?\n- How do you know if a solar panel is charging a battery?\n- How long do solar batteries hold their charge?\nCan a solar panel overcharge a battery?\nYes, when a solar panel is directly connected to the battery, then it can be overcharged.\nA 12 Volt solar panel can give an output of 21 Volts during peak sunlight.\nThe 12 Volt battery should be charged to a maximum voltage of 14.4 Volts..\nHow long will a 100ah battery run a fridge?\n1000 hoursA very small user of power is a 1.2 watt LED light running on a 12 volt power source will use 1.2W / 12V = 0.1 amps.

Many species are endemic to this region and found nowhere else in the world. The rolling foothills of our Piedmont region were once home to “Piedmont prairies” with a plant palette similar to that of Midwestern prairies.\nHowever, much of this land has been used and abused since the 1700s, the mountains timbered, the rich soil of its gentle foothills eroded and exhausted by cotton, the rivers polluted by the mills and industries which gravitated to their banks.\nThe Swamp Rabbit Trail follows the path of an old shortline railroad that carried freight (often timber) from the mountains above Marietta into Greenville.

In the center of the city, the river drops significantly to form Reedy River Falls, the focal point of beautiful Falls Park. From there it continues to flow south into Laurens County where it eventually joins the Saluda River at Lake Greenwood.\nIn the late 1700s, European settlers purchased land along the Reedy River and established grist mills and trading posts. The river became the center of Greenville’s growing economy, and by the late 1800s the grist mills had given way to textile mills. Unfortunately, the Reedy suffered greatly from the city’s progress as it became polluted and unsuitable for recreational activities.\nIt wasn’t until 1967 that the condition of the river began to improve. The Carolina Foothills Garden Club reclaimed 26 acres along the Reedy in downtown Greenville to be developed as the popular Falls Park. Since that time, the Garden Club and the City of Greenville have worked alongside various state and federal agencies to develop the park and clean up the river. Recently, the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources and other groups have created a watershed planning guide to further ensure the health of the river.\nReflections on the Reedy River\nSCIWAY thanks Jeff Hammond of Greenville and Jenny Munro of Greer for contributing these beautiful photos to the South Carolina Picture Project. Jeff describes his picture as follows; “Here is a picture taken last month in Downtown Greenville, right on the Reedy River overlooking a few buildings in the center of downtown Greenville. The Reedy River runs straight through downtown Greenville and overlooks the famous Swamp Rabbit Trail.”\nJenny describes her photo here: “I work in downtown Greenville and was walking toward the park when I glanced over the bridge in the opposite direction. We usually think of the Reedy River as relatively bucolic, but it really is an urban river surrounded by buildings and sidewalks. The curves in the river and the bridge caught my eye.”\nReedy River Map\nReedy River Add Info and More Photos\nThe purpose of the South Carolina Picture Project is to celebrate the beauty of the Palmetto State and create a permanent digital repository for our cultural landmarks and natural landscapes.", "score": 0.833485842, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:156fe5c7-af1a-4cee-81f9-928a43e9098d>", "text": "Commercial fishermen I know have told me that have seen everything, including sharks, in their nets or in the sound when they fish near the inlets.

What happened to all these dunes and why is Jockey's Ridge the only one left?\nAnswer: Well, J. Ridge, as we affectionately call it, is not the only one left. There are several near the Nags Head Post Office, part of the Seven Sisters range, there are many in Nags Head Woods and there is Run Hill and also Kill Devil Hill where the Wright Brothers Monument sits. There were several in the Corolla area that have been bulldozed. J. Ridge was saved largely by the efforts of Carolista Baum and a campaign by locals who lobbied the state government to make it a park when it was discovered, one day, that it was private property and the bulldozers were already in motion. A great example of grassroots environmentalism.\nQuestion 4: Where are all of the rabbits during the day that we see along the road on Roanoke Island and on Highway 12 in the morning or evenings? Do they really have webbed feet? Do they drown in hurricanes?\nAnswer: Those rabbits you are seeing in those locations are known as “Marsh Rabbits” and they do indeed have webbed feet. Their ears are shorter and coats blacker than cottontails. They are able to swim for short distances and also, unlike cottontails, they build lodges similar to muskrats. A photographer friend was trying to photograph them along the marsh and would hear a tell-tale plop, plop as her wary quarries bailed into the water to get away. They are also crepuscular which means they feed at dawn and at dusk so that is why you don't see them in the daytime. And yes, during times of intense sound flooding they can drown. I have only seen that happen one time in my 30 years here, but not to fear, because they rebound quickly.

They have been in Greenville for five seasons, though this is the first year they are called the “Swamp Rabbits.” Previously, they were known as the “Road Warriors” – a subtle and generic nod to the community’s current automobile manufacturing economy (metro Greenville is both the national headquarters of Michelin and the BMW’s only US plant). However, the name never really resonated outside of a small, hard-core group of fans. So, the team turned to local heritage for their new name:\n“We determined that we wanted our new identity to honor a piece of Greenville’s history while also being relevant within the community today,” said Fred Festa, owner of the Swamp Rabbits. “Ultimately, we selected the Swamp Rabbits because the name holds dear to a variety of residents, businesses, popular recreational areas and the historic landmark, the Swamp Rabbit railroad, dating back the 1920s in Greenville.”\nThe railroad, which linked the South Carolina city with the coal fields of Tennessee, became known as the “Swamp Rabbit” by locals who would use the freight train as a means of transportation to picnic in northern Greenville County.\nIn a recent, long-form interview on the Tao of Sports podcast, the team’s Executive Vice President Chris Lewis describes that that the name change (though controversial among some supporters) not only links the franchise to the community through one of its most locally resonant histories, it also provides a strong symbol that the team is committed to the community. Furthermore, he notes that it is meant to spur local interest in the team – both from sponsors and the general public – and drive new merchandise sales. Surprisingly, this turn towards local heritage has resonated across North America, with both American and Canadian sports media outlets – as well as a nationally-trending social media – covering the name change.\nThough it remains to be seen whether the Swamp Rabbit’s name will ultimately pay-off in terms of increased local interest, it does point to the fact that there remains a strong link between sport and broader forms of local heritage, and that local heritages are often unique, appealing, and (dare I say) authentic.", "score": 0.016253988870476736, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:f5f1ad52-ffcc-4853-91a0-2026f9075466>", "text": "Sunday, November 24, 2013\n\"Hi Nicola, I thought you would enjoy seeing the wonderful ring you and your husband were so instrumental in creating for Maggie and I.

EI aims to address developmental delays in D/HH children, focusing on communication skills (verbal and sign language).\n3. Hearing impairment hinders normal speech and language development.\n4. Hearing screening for every baby is recommended within the first month, with follow-ups up to 2 years of age.\n5. Early identification and intervention can lessen the impact on a child's development.\n6. Congenital, delayed-onset, progressive, or acquired hearing loss can be identified through risk factors, baby responses to sounds, and professional help.\n7. Audiologic monitoring is necessary for children at risk for hearing loss.\n8. Newborn hearing screening is crucial for early identification and intervention.\n9. The Joint Committee on Infant Hearing recommends:\n   - Screening by 1 month of age,\n   - Hearing and medical evaluations by 3 months of age,\n   - Amplification within 1 month of diagnosis,\n   - Early intervention services by 6 months of age.\n10. Family-centered practice is essential in the identification and treatment of young D/HH children.\n11. Guam EHDI ensures all babies get screened by 1 month, with a Diagnostic Audiological Evaluation by 3 months for those who fail the screening, and early intervention services by 6 months for babies with hearing loss.\n12. For concerns about a baby's hearing, discuss with the baby's doctor or contact Guam Early Intervention System.\n13. The EHDI National Goals aim to identify all infants and children with late onset, progressive, or acquired hearing loss at the earliest possible time.\n14. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Hearing Loss Team provides resources and information on hearing loss.\n15. The Maternal Exit Survey and the Maternal CATI Interview address factors that impede or enable families to follow-up for early hearing evaluation and intervention.\n16. The average age of identification of children with hearing loss has been reduced with comprehensive EHDI programs.\n17. Early identification and intervention can provide the best opportunity for children with hearing loss to reach their maximum potential in areas like language, communication, social and emotional development, and school achievement.\n18. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends universal newborn hearing screening programs nationwide.\n19. The goal is to identify 100% of infants with significant congenital hearing loss by 3 months of age, with appropriate intervention by 6 months of age.\n20. The Listening Stars: Parent Infant Program (0-18 Months) assists children diagnosed with developmental delays in identifying and understanding sounds.\n21. Baby Developmental Milestones can be used as a guide to monitor a child's development from birth to 18 months.\n22. Early Intervention plays a vital role in children with developmental delays, especially when intervention begins before 6 months of age.\n23.

However, data reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that some D/HH children were not documented as having received early intervention services. In addition, some D/HH children may be born with other conditions that also can result in developmental delays. Referring D/HH children to early intervention as soon as possible will help ensure that they can reach their full potential. Early Intervention represents the goal of the entire Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) process.

The main focus of early identification and early intervention for a child with hearing loss is on developing communication skills, both verbal and sign language, to the maximum possible extent. Further, if hearing impairment is associated with other disorders like mental retardation, blindness, cerebral palsy, etc., the intervention program addresses those needs also.\nHearing impairment is detrimental to the normal speech and language development in such children. While speech and language are innate skills of human beings, these skills develop only by hearing, listening and incorporating the use of words, intonations, voice variations, and the patterns in which words are strung together to form expressions.\nWhy Early Intervention?\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a hearing screening to be done for every baby a few weeks after birth, and also follow-up visits up to two years of age. With modern technology of manual and automatic hearing testing routines, congenital hearing loss is being identified in children before they are 3 months of age. Identification of hearing impairment is possible by looking into the risk factors, responses of the baby to sounds around and seeking professional help when the risks and signs indicate a hearing problem.\nRisk Factors for Hearing Loss\nSome of the important risk factors associated with hearing loss can be listed and an informal screening can help in determining whether to look out for signs of hearing impairment. The risk factors include:\n• Family history of hearing impairment\n• Prenatal infections in the mother like rubella, herpes simplex and toxoplasmosis\n• Abnormal development of the structures in head and neck region like cleft palate, atresia (absence of pinna), etc\n• Premature birth\n• Medications given in neonatal period\n• Syndrome associated with hearing loss like Waardenburg, neurofibromatosis, etc\n• Recurrent infections in the ear, nose and throat\n• Infections like meningitis, measles, mumps, etc\n• Head trauma\nCertain symptoms may be noticed by the mother or primary caregiver of the baby that can call for a detailed hearing assessment to be done.", "score": 0.858017921, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:ae5027e9-0b42-4dd3-a40f-01446335461b>", "text": "Permanent childhood hearing loss can be congenital, delayed-onset, progressive, or acquired in nature. Congenital hearing loss refers to hearing loss that is present at birth and is often identified through a newborn hearing screening conducted shortly after birth. While estimates vary, some hearing loss in childhood is delayed-onset or progressive in nature. As a result, it is important to provide audiologic monitoring over time for children who are considered to be \"at risk\" for hearing loss. In addition, some mild hearing losses as well as auditory neuropathy may not be identified through newborn hearing screening due to the current limitations of the test equipment or testing methodology used.\nHearing is critical to speech and language development, communication, literacy, and learning. Early identification and intervention of hearing loss can lessen the impact on a child's development (Sininger, Grimes, & Christensen, 2010; Yoshinaga-Itano, Baca, & Sedey, 2010). The Joint Committee on Infant Hearing (JCIH, 2007) recommends that\n- all children be screened for hearing loss no later than 1 month of age,\n- hearing and medical evaluations be completed no later than 3 months of age,\n- infants with confirmed hearing loss are fit with amplification (if the family chooses and if appropriate) within 1 month of diagnosis,\n- early intervention services begin no later than 6 months of age.\nNote: The scope of this content is limited to the diagnosis and management of permanent hearing loss for children from birth through 5 years of age from an audiological perspective. Resources for hearing screening and habilitation, as well as hearing loss for school-age and adult populations, are under development.\nFamilies who are actively involved in the assessment and treatment process achieve better outcomes (DesJardin, 2006). It is paramount that audiologists incorporate family-centered practice into the identification and treatment of young children who are deaf or hard of hearing; family-centered activities include\n- engaging the family and using the child's toys from home in various aspects of the evaluation and therapy sessions,\n- suspending judgment and building rapport with the family about their needs and interests,\n- matching re/habilitation with the family needs and goals,\n- recognizing the family's rights regarding informed consent and confidentiality.\nThe goal of family-centered practice is to create a partnership with the family so that the family fully participates in all aspects of the child's care.", "score": 0.855637193, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:8070eae0-4547-4fd7-b957-bf027bce8566>", "text": "Language development is impacted if there is any loss in the ability to hear.\nEven a mild hearing loss can dramatically effect a child’s language development.

Both surveys will be available in English and Spanish.\nHearing loss is the most common disorder that can be detected through newborn screening programs. Prior to the implementation of newborn hearing screening, children with hearing loss typically were not identified until 2 to 3 years of age. This is well beyond the period of early language development. Now, with comprehensive EHDI programs, the average age of identification of children with hearing loss has been reduced so that it is now possible to provide interventions for children younger than one year of age. With early identification, children with hearing loss can begin receiving appropriate intervention services that provide the best opportunity for these children to reach their maximum potential in such areas as language, communication, social and emotional development, and school achievement.\nNewborn hearing screening is only the first step in the identification of children with hearing loss. Children who do not pass their screening need to be further evaluated to determine if they have hearing loss. The value of newborn hearing screening cannot be realized unless children complete the screening, evaluation, and intervention process. Since recent data indicate that nearly 40 percent of children do not complete the evaluation-intervention process, this project is designed to understand what barriers exist in following through with evaluation and intervention.

The statement, published in the February 1999 issue of Pediatrics, discusses the justifications for universal hearing screening, tracking and follow-up, identification and intervention, evaluation, and other recommendations and issues. The AAP establishes parameters with the goal of ensuring that all newborns with hearing loss be identified.\n“Significant hearing loss is one of the most common major abnormalities present at birth and, if undetected, will impede speech, language and cognitive development,” according to the policy statement. The average age for detection of significant hearing loss in the United States is less than 14 months, but the AAP would like to see all newborns screened before they leave the hospital so that treatment can be initiated before these infants are six months old. The policy states that about one to three per 1,000 infants in well-baby nurseries have significant loss of hearing in both ears, and about two to four per 100 infants in the intensive care unit have hearing loss.\nThe following five essential elements for an effective screening program were identified by the AAP: initial screening with a test having a high degree of sensitivity and specificity; tracking and follow-up; identification; intervention; and evaluation. Guidelines for each of the five essential elements are discussed in the statement. The following guidelines have been excerpted from the section of the guidelines that discusses identification and intervention in a universal neonatal hearing screening program:\nThe goal of universal screening is that 100 percent of infants with significant congenital hearing loss be identified by three months of age, and appropriate and necessary intervention be initiated by six months of age.\nAppropriate and necessary care for the infant with significant hearing loss should be directed and coordinated by the child's physician within the medical home, with support from appropriate ancillary services.\nA regionalized approach to identification and intervention for infants with significant hearing loss is essential, ensuring access for all children with significant hearing loss to appropriate expert services. The AAP recognizes that professionals with competency in this area may not be available in every community.

This Appalachian region is acknowledged nationally as suffering from extreme health disparities and is underserved in healthcare services. The 54 Appalachian counties in Kentucky are plagued by poverty unemployment and a shortage of healthcare.

There has been much work in recent years to reduce the age of diagnosis and intervention for these children. The paper by Pimperton et al,1 provides important evidence to support the observations of those working clinically with these children, that early identification and habilitation of significant hearing impairment in children pays dividends in terms of education. The cohort of children on whom this paper is based was identified by universal newborn hearing screening before the establishment of NHSP, the national newborn hearing screening programme. The same cohort was studied earlier at an average age of 7.9 years2 when significant benefit in language development was shown in those diagnosed before 9 months of age compared with those identified when older than 9 months. The particular value of this paper is that it has looked at performance in the second decade as well as the first, and there is a paucity of work in this age group. Pimperton et al have highlighted the value of early diagnosis and intervention in establishing good language skills, which underpin later reading comprehension.\nManagement of deafness in children has seen a significant change in the last 15 years. Prior to newborn hearing screening, the average age of diagnosis of deafness severe enough to compromise speech and language development (moderate-to-profound deafness bilaterally) was 26 months, with hearing aid fitting at 32.2 months.3 Many of these children failed to acquire good speech and oral language. Amplification using hearing aids gave access to sound, but the late start meant that the critical period for good speech and language acquisition was passed. The average reading age of a deaf school leaver was said to be about 8 years, and career and educational opportunities were, as a consequence, limited.\nThe impetus for change came from the Joint Committee on Infant Hearing, a multidisciplinary American group established in 1969, which first examined the evidence to support early screening and early intervention.

Today there are scores of varieties, sizes, shapes, colors, flavors, and they all have a spicy heat of varying degrees.

Well, I’m here to help you out by giving you some suitable alternatives for poblano peppers. Some of this pepper may vary slightly in flavor, but they are sure to give you a wonderful result.\n1. Green Bell Pepper\nIf you are looking for a mildly flavored pepper, green bell pepper should be your go-to pepper. It can replace poblano peppers in stuffing recipes. Unlike other bell peppers, the green bell pepper isn’t sweet, but it is sweeter than poblano pepper.\nThey share the same color, so if you need that green color associated with poblano, green bell peppers can seamlessly replace poblano peppers; they also have large cavities, making them good for stuffing. If you need bell peppers to be spicier, you can add some chili powder or any other spicy seasoning to them before or during preparation. Use the same measurements where the recipe calls for poblano chili but regulate the chili powder added.\n2.

Ancho chile is 1000‐2000 SCO units.\nHow to use ancho chile\nWhen cooking with ancho chile peppers, it is essential to understand that although they have moderately mild heat, they still have a kick. On the Scoville Heat Units, the ancho peppers measure between 1,000 and 2,000 compared to a bell pepper which measures 0 and the jalapeño which measures 5,000. You know where you stand with the ancho pepper, and how much to use. The ancho peppers are normally re-hydrated before use. Place them in hot water for up to 30 minutes, and they are ready to use. Make sure that you seed and stem them first, then they are ready to season sauces, stews, soups, salsa, and any food that you want to add some spice to. Learning how to use ancho chile is as easy as adding any other spices to your food when you want a mild to moderate heat content.\nOther uses for ancho peppers\nWhen someone asks what ancho chile peppers are, a good answer would be that they are the seasonings used for chili powder that gives chili that awesome flavor. The peppers are ground while they are still dried to make the chili powder, and can be used in many other recipes besides chili.

They are known as the 4Cs :\nCut, Color, Clarity and Carat weight.\nIt is the combination of these four C that determines a diamond's value. By changing any of the characteristics, you can dramatically affect the diamond's value, all other factors being equal.\nUnderstanding Carat Weight\nA diamond's weight is measured in what is known as a Carat? which is a small unit of measurement equal to 200 milligrams. Carat is not a measure of a diamond's size, since cutting a diamond to different proportions can affect its weight. (The word Carat is used to express the purity of gold, and is not used in relation to diamonds.) Here is a diagram that shows the relative size of various carat weights in a diamond that is cut to the same proportions:\nThe most important thing to remember when it comes to a diamond's carat weight is that it is not the only factor that determines a diamond's value. In other words, bigger does not necessarily mean better. All four C's Cut, Color, Clarity and Carat Weight must be balanced in order to arrive at a diamond that fits your budget. None of the 4Cs is mutually exclusive, nor is any one more important than the others.\nMore on Carat:\nThe word carat actually comes from the word carob (as in carob seeds), which is how ancient cultures measured the weight of diamonds on their scales. In 1913, however, the weight was standardized internationally and adapted to the metric system.\nAlthough they can be measured when mounted in jewelry, diamonds are most accurately weighed when they are not mounted in a setting. In fact, gemological laboratories such as the Gemological Institute of America (GIA) and American Gemological Society (AGS) will only grade diamonds that are unmounted. A diamond grading report will tell you the exact carat weight, to the nearest hundredth of a carat, for that particular diamond.\nEach Carat is divided into 100 parts called 'points.' So a one carat diamond has 100 points. Points in a fraction of one carat are measured within ranges, so that a 3/4 carat diamond may have between .69 and .82 points and still be considered a 3/4 carat.", "score": 0.9832287342877152, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:74c6fa7f-97a3-44e4-80da-e7b988495a6d>", "text": "A \"10-point\" diamond weighs 1/10th of a carat and a 50-point stone weighs half a carat.", "score": 0.85422039, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:031af047-681b-4d20-9dce-a44557f5dd99>", "text": "Two diamonds of equal Carat Weight may vary substantially in price due to their Cut, Color and Clarity.

This martian atmosphere gas is present in almost all of the martian (SNC) meteorites, including ALH 84001.\n10. The martian (SNC) meteorites are believed to be from Mars due to their distinct oxygen isotope compositions and the presence of extraterrestrial clays or water-bearing minerals.\n11. Mars's atmosphere is made of Carbon Dioxide (CO2).\n12. Mars may have become more habitable over time due to collisions with large space rocks like asteroids and comets.\n13. The collisions may be some of the leading factors in why Mars has a habitable temperature range and flowing water among other potential life-supporting features.\n14. Mars's lost magnetosphere may have been caused by meteorite strikes, scraping away Mars's atmosphere over four billion years.\n15. A recent study suggests that Mars may have had an oxygen-rich atmosphere 4 billion years ago.\n16. The Hope Probe, a planetary orbiter, is expected to collect new data on Mars's atmosphere and evaluate its seasonal and daily changes.\n17. Substantial geophysical evidence suggests that Mars was once a much warmer and more humid world, with a lot of liquid water on Mars's surface that could have been optimal for some form of life to evolve.\n18. The evaporation-to-space route for Mars's water is flawed, as it allows for the disassociation of water molecules into free hydrogen and oxygen atoms.\n19. Volumes of data collected by the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft have led some scientists to conclude that liquid water may have existed on the surface of Mars relatively recently in its history.\n20. High-resolution MGS images have shown evidence of glacial activity in the recent past, in the form of moraines and crevasses similar to those on Earth carved by moving sheets of ice.\n21. There is no visual evidence of glaciers on the Red Planet today, though.\n22. Some planetary scientists have argued that gullies that appear to have been formed virtually in the present day formed when groundwater deposits reached the surface in the sides of crater walls, although others have argued that carbon dioxide ice deposits could form similar features.\n23. The presence of glaciers suggests that there must have been standing bodies of water as well.\n24. The Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) Curiosity found abnormal levels of methane in the atmosphere of Mars, which could have been produced by life.\n25.

This suggests, researchers say, that the early Martian surface was full of oxygen. The findings have been published in the journal Nature.\n\"What we have shown is that both meteorites and surface volcanic rocks are consistent with similar origins in the deep interior of Mars but that the surface rocks come from a more oxygen-rich environment, probably caused by recycling of oxygen-rich materials into the interior,\" said Bernard Wood, a co-author of the study and a professor in Oxford University's Department of Earth Sciences. \"This result is surprising because while the meteorites are geologically 'young', around 180 million to 1,400 million years old, the Spirit rover was analysing a very old part of Mars, more than 3,700 million years old.\"\nWood and his colleagues believe that the different compositions of the Martian material may be due to subduction, the process by which surface material is recycled into a planet's interior. The hypothesis is that Mars was very oxidized early in its history, and that subduction has brought early surface material to where Spirit found it, while the meteorites are younger Martian material from deeper within the planet.\n\"The implication is that Mars had an oxygen-rich atmosphere at a time, about 4000 million years ago, well before the rise of atmospheric oxygen on earth around 2500 million years ago,\" said Wood. \"As oxidation is what gives Mars its distinctive colour it is likely that the 'red planet' was wet, warm, and rusty billions of years before Earth's atmosphere became oxygen rich.\"", "score": 0.833949566, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:9ad55a17-123a-48b4-916d-652eaf7d0d96>", "text": "There is no liquid water, but there may be ice in the craters at the north and south poles.

It once had a magnetic field, but it decayed four billion years ago, leaving Mars with no protection from solar radiation. This stripped Mars of most of its atmosphere, leaving it with only one per cent of the pressure of Earth’s atmosphere.\nHowever, the pressure must have been higher in the past because we see what appear to be runoff channels and dried-up lakes.

Its desolate environment is inhospitable to life: liquid water is nearly, if not wholly, nonexistent, and the oxygen-rich atmosphere that gives the planet its familiar reddish tinge is hostile to the early biosynthesis required for life — historically thought to be only possible in oxygen-poor atmospheres.\nOver the years, though, NASA rovers have found geological evidence that points toward the past presence of flowing liquid water and minerals that form only in oxygen-poor environments, suggesting that the planet once had conditions to support early life.\nThe researchers modeled Mars’ climate and atmospheric chemistry, actually finding “fluctuations” between these oxygen-poor — or reducing — and oxygen-rich — or oxidizing — conditions over time, according to Robin D. Wordsworth, lead author and Harvard professor of Environmental Science and Engineering.\nThe fluctuating presence or absence of oxygen on Mars would have affected its climate over time, according to Wordsworth. Because oxygen is a poor greenhouse gas, the Martian atmosphere would have trapped less heat during its oxygen-rich periods. Oxygen-poor periods, however, were characterized by a greater abundance of hydrogen gas, which — in combination with carbon dioxide — would have acted as a “potent” greenhouse gas and more efficiently retained heat.\n“There is a current popular hypothesis for warming early Mars in a reducing environment with a lot of hydrogen.

Once a warm, wet world, Mars lost its magnetic field more than 4 billion years ago when its outer core cooled, shutting off the dynamo that kept the field in place. That exposed the planet to the solar wind, which clawed away at the atmosphere; and that in turn allowed the planet’s water to sputter off into space. To look at Mars today is to see a desert world, stamped with the dry riverbeds, delicate deltas and deep ocean basins hinting at the water that is no more.\nAt least, that’s the long-accepted view. But according to a study published Mar. 16 in Science by a team of researchers at the California Institute of Technology, that scenario might be all wrong. Mars is dry, alright—or at least it appears to be. But the researchers say much of its water—from 30% to a staggering 99% of it—is still there. It simply retreated into the martian rocks and clay rather than escaping into space.\nJust how much water once flowed across the surface of Mars is expressed by a unit of measure known as “global equivalent layer” (GEL)—the depth that the water would be if it were not sequestered in basins and rivers, but instead were spread evenly across the entire planet. The best estimates for Mars’s original GEL is anywhere from 100 to 1,500 meters (330 to 4,900 ft). That’s an awfully wide range, but today it’s considerably narrower: the modern-day water on the planet’s surface—almost entirely trapped in its polar ice caps—has a GEL of just 20 to 40 m.\nWhen Mars lost its atmosphere, all that original water had to go somewhere. The evaporation-to-space route was always the easiest explanation—but it’s a flawed one, too. The problem, as the Caltech researchers knew, involves hydrogen. As Martian water molecules rise into and then escape from the atmosphere, they disassociate into free hydrogen and oxygen atoms. An oxygen atom in water is just an oxygen atom, but hydrogen comes in two forms: ordinary hydrogen (with a single proton in its nucleus) and deuterium (with a proton and a neutron). Water molecules made of heavier deuterium instead of ordinary hydrogen are known, straightforwardly enough, as heavy water.", "score": 5.77189224602954e-05, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:eaaf1e41-e2f9-44e5-a561-cdee80837e84>", "text": "Does the Red Planet have liquid water today?\nBY JEFF FOUST\nPosted: July 19, 2001\nVolumes of data collected by the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft have led some scientists to conclude that liquid water may have existed on the surface of Mars relatively recently in its history.\nIn a paper published in a recent issue of the journal Nature, University of Arizona hydrologist Victor Baker concludes that, rather than being cold and dry for most of the last 3.9 billion years, liquid water and ice has shaped the surface of Mars within the last 10 million years.\nElsewhere on the planet, Baker and other scientists have seen evidence of massive floods, gullies, and even lakebeds that appeared to harbor liquid water for up to ten thousand years, a possibility only if the Martian climate was much warmer and wetter than at the present.\nMGA images have also shown evidence of glacial activity in the recent past, in the form of moraines -- piles of rock carried and deposited by glaciers on Earth -- and crevasses that are similar to those on Earth carved by moving sheets of ice. There is no visual evidence of glaciers themselves on Mars today, though.\nThe glacier evidence is particularly interesting to Baker. \"If there are glaciers, then Mars is very different than many people have described it,\" he said. \"Glaciers aren't ice cubes, sitting there to waste away. In order to have glaciers, you have to have precipitation. Water has to move through the atmosphere, and it precipitates and makes the ice grow.\"\n\"The presence of glaciers means that Mars once was a lot warmer, and that there was much more water on the Martian surface,\" Baker added. \"The presence of glaciers suggests that there must have been standing bodies of water as well.\"\nOther evidence suggests that liquid water may exist on Mars today. High-resolution MGS images released last June showed evidence of gullies that appear to have been formed virtually in the present day. Some planetary scientists have argued that those gullies formed when groundwater deposits reached the surface in the sides of crater walls, although other have argued that carbon dioxide ice deposits could form similar features.\nBaker thinks that Mars may go through cycles of extended cold, dry periods punctuated by warmer, wetter spells.

Sometimes the meaning is expanded to include any life that is based on the same sort of water-mediated carbon chemistry (with amino acids and proteins) that we have on Earth, but with some other inheritance mechanism that does not use DNA or RNA.\nLife as we don’t know it would include life that some speculate could exist on Saturn’s moon Titan, where the temperatures are far below the freezing point of water. However, even in this bitter cold, hydrocarbons like methane and ethane are liquid, and might conceivably form the basis for carbon-based life very different from that on Earth. Astrobiologists are uncertain how we could recognize or detect life as we don’t know it, although presumably any life would use energy to change its chemical environment, thus perhaps providing clues to its existence.\nIf the presence of life on Earth suggests that life emerges on a planet whenever conditions are favorable, why is there apparently no evidence that life began here more than once?\nNo one knows whether life emerges on a planet whenever conditions are favorable. The only example of life we know is on our planet. It is entirely possible that life has begun several times on Earth. However, if this happened the competition between different life forms would have led to the survival of only one kind.

Join me in a five-part series as I discuss some important aspects of preventative care, including 1) warm-ups and cool downs 2) physical conditioning 3) adequate rest and recovery 4) footwear and floors, and 5) self-care and management.\n*As my current area of focus within the dance world is primarily partner dances, many of my examples will be based on this style of dance, but the themes I will be discussing are broadly applicable to other forms of dance.\nDo I really need to do a warm-up?\nHow many of us would head to the gym for a workout and immediately hit the treadmill in a full sprint without a warm-up? Yet, how many dancers have showed up to a social dance where the first song playing is so good that they just have to dance, regardless of how fast and energetic the song may be?\nProperly warming up your body before hitting the dance floor can reduce your risk of such injuries as, muscle strains, tendonitis, and overuse injuries. Every dance practice, performance, and social dance evening should begin with a warm-up to prepare your body for exercise, and end with a cool-down to kick-start your post-dance recovery.\nHow does a warm-up help?\nWarming up with light aerobic exercise not only improves performance, but may also reduce the risk of injury. Warm-ups lead to a number of physiological changes in your body that are necessary to prepare you mentally as well as physically, including:\n- increased rate and depth of breathing, which increases the intake of oxygen and release of carbon dioxide\n- increased heart rate, which allows more oxygen and fuel to be delivered to working muscles\n- increased elasticity of muscles and tendons, which increases range of motion of joints and reduces risk of tearing\n- improved proprioception (joint position sense) which improves not only balance and stability, but also awareness of body position which can help with aesthetic aspect of your movements\n- improved signalling of nerves, which improves reaction time and your ability to generate a muscle contraction\nHow do I warm up?", "score": 0.839292586, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:85785016-bfef-4557-a453-501ded74570b>", "text": "November 2000 https://www.iadms.org/page/1\n2) Delegete, A.

It strikes the fifth metatarsal, the bone that lies along the outer edge of the foot. It usually happens when a dancer jumps and lands badly, coming down on an inverted (turned-in) foot. As the name “dancer’s fracture” suggests, this is a common ballet injury.\nSesamoiditis: When a dancer is on demi-pointe, her weight rests on the sesamoid bones, which lie just behind the big toe.

But the person getting injured most often isn't who you might think.\n\"Men don't usually have back problems, even though they're the ones doing the lifting,\" said Ballard, who now is a registered respiratory therapist and registered pulmonary function technologist for Baptist St. Anthony's Health System. \"I have seen backs hurt of women who are being carried. They have to do a lot of bending at the waist, and they sometimes get tweaks in their backs.\"\nBallard said that both stretching and massage will help keep vulnerable muscles from being injured.\n\"Those muscles get worked so hard,\" he said. \"It's important to stretch and have those muscles massaged - especially to protect the ones that don't really grow in size and are hard to strengthen.\"\nBarbara Harris, a trainer and rehabilitation specialist for the Boston Ballet, said that a normally curved spine acts like a spring, absorbing impact from dance movements. But dancers think a straight spine is better - \"it makes them look very lifted and very long,\" she said.\nThe \"lifted\" look, with a straight back and neck, and pelvis tucked under the back, makes dancers seem to float as they move, Harris said. However, dancers can get the same look with less risk to their backs simply by keeping the pelvis in a neutral position, neither tilted forward nor back, she said.\nThose who don't prepare their backs properly may wind up at a sports medicine clinic and at rehab. At the clinic, they may get X-rays and bone scans. The scans have the advantage of picking up tiny tears before they get big enough for X-ray spotting, when the injuries are harder to heal, Micheli said.\nAt rehab, Harris works with a Pilates-based system of flexibility and strengthening - a method that often is familiar to dancers. She also focuses on teaching them how to recognize and foster good back alignment.\nAlmost all dancers can dance after treatment, Micheli said.

Just to join the Riverdance team typically meant 15 years of rigorous practice since age five or six. Prior to a two hour show, there would be a full week of rehearsals everyday, adding up to about 40 hours of practice. Its amazing how the dancers are able to persevere despite the painful blisters and injuries they come across, and still be fully energized to give their best to the audience. The commitment and determination of the dancers are an inspiration to youth and adults worldwide, reminding them that any dream can be accomplished if patience and heart is put into it.\nThe interview started with a few steps taught by the four Riverdance dancers. There is no other ways to understand Irish dance better than to learn and feel it- and it wasn’t easy. The steps were simple, but we had to move really fast, with energy, and it must be quite nerve-wrecking because a little delay could be magnified by the synchronised beat from the hard shoes with fibre glass.\nWhat impressed me the most is the passion shown in the interview towards Irish dancing, that everyone in Ireland is so involved in their culture and knows the dance. I guess it is this mutual connection and interest that bonded the people together and made Riverdance such an epic success. In fact, dancers of Riverdance came from different backgrounds, but after all they have gone through, Riverdance is just one big family. Quite literally! There has been 35 marriages between company members!\nTen years ago, I went to see a spectacular show in New York called Riverdance, and last week I got to meet some of the Riverdance dancers! Laura Minogue even taught me dance steps. It takes lots of practice before you can dance on the high beat.\nWe also got to have a close look at some of the show’s costumes.

The core originates the majority of the full body movements that you perform. The core is also what determines your posture as it plays a large role in aligning your ribs, spine, and pelvis.\nAs a dancer this means a strong core is essential from standing in basic positions all the way to balancing and even turning! At a young age we develop muscle memory to keep the “ribs in” as you have heard from your ballet teachers many times. Holding those “ribs in” is just a start to learning core strength at a young age.\nContrary to what you may think, your core is actually more than just the abdominal muscles. The core consists of these major muscle groups including a few key back muscles;\nExternal and Internal Obliques\nThere are simple exercises that you can do year round to help strengthen, tone, and firm your core for peak performance. You may even find that you will break some of the bad habits developed in ballet class after finding your core strength.\nFor Example; Many back injuries are caused by a weak core. If we work on strengthening the abdominal muscles and sides, we can take some of the stress off the back. All ballet movements will feel much easier and freer once you strengthen your core.\nI have put together a comprehensive eBook with over 30 pages of core conditioning exercises for dancers.

To continue on in dance the style has to be chosen by the dancer. The number of styles of dance are uncountable but the most popular are ballet, hip hop, contemporary, and ballroom.\nUsually those four are the styles that become a profession.

They are not enclosed in metal, unlike car and truck drivers. They rely on protective gear to prevent injuries when accidents occur.

That also means that a lot of people are at risk of motorcycle accidents.\nMany attorneys specialize in specific practice areas like motorcycle accidents accidents because they are such major issues. For motorcycle accidents specifically, serious and sometimes fatal injuries can occur, which is why many attorneys cater to this issue. But the medical bills and the legal fees are all preventable, if everybody would just be careful on the road.\nBelow are the most common injuries associated with motorcycle accidents, because knowledge is the first step to prevention.\nThe most common injury that can be sustained in a motorcycle accident is road rash. This can be sustained when a rider slides to the pavement, creating friction between the pavement and the skin. The injury does not just include bruises, cuts, and scrapes. It can include infections, surface nerve damages, and skin irritations.\nSometimes, road rash cannot be prevented, especially on highly traumatic instances. But it can be minimized by using the proper protective gear that will protect your skin against powerful scratching. Wear leather jackets, motorcycle jeans, gloves, and knee pads.\nWhen a motorcyclist gets ejected because of a crash or a collision, his first instinct is to put his arms out to lessen the impact of his fall to a surface. This has the tendency to put most of the pressure on the biker’s arms, resulting into injury. At worst, it may even cause permanent nerve damage to the upper body. To prevent arm injuries, always wear sturdy jackets and elbow pads when riding.\nAnother body part that is very vulnerable during motorcycle accidents is the leg. The most common leg injuries are large cuts, scrapes and road rashes due to skidding, shattered knees, and fractures. At worst, the injuries sustained may cause permanent disability. To avoid leg injuries, always wear pants, knee pads, and motorcycle boots.\nHead and Brain Injuries\nThere is a reason why motorcyclists always wear helmets.

The integrated virus is thought to be transcribed along with the other intronic regions of the cellular gene, but is then merely spliced out. This mechanism has been confirmed in J-Lat cells, a CD4+ T-cell line used as a model for HIV-1 postintegration latency . Lenasi and colleagues have shown that transcriptional interference could be reversed by inhibiting the upstream transcription or by cooperatively activating viral transcription initiation and elongation. Of note, certain host transcription factors and/or viral activators, which bind strongly to their cognate sites, could resist the passage of \"read-through\" RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) . As studies in yeast have demonstrated that the elongating polymerase is followed by a rapid refolding of histones in a closed configuration to counteract transcription initiation at cryptic sites in the transcription unit , chromatin structure and epigenetic events could also be implicated in transcriptional interference. Conversely, Han et al.  have demonstrated that upstream transcription could enhance HIV-1 gene expression without significant modification of the chromatin status in the region when the provirus is integrated in the same orientation as the host gene. These partially contradictory studies have been questioned  based on earlier studies that reported transcriptional interference as important in repressing viral promoters integrated in the same orientation as an upstream host gene promoter [60, 65, 66]. Interestingly, Marcello and colleagues  have recently reported that an integrated provirus suffering from transcriptional interference in basal conditions becomes transcriptionally active following Tat expression; and that this provirus can switch off the transcription of the host gene within which it has integrated or can allow the coexistence of expression of both host and viral genes. Further analysis of the mechanisms exploited by host genes to regulate a viral promoter inserted in their transcriptional unit or by the virus to counterbalance the host gene control will be needed to completely elucidate these transcriptional interference events.", "score": 0.826187074, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:5434ee51-ac62-4869-84b3-33a3a1412778>", "text": "Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\nTo achieve successful infection enveloped viruses need to fuse with a host cell membrane to deliver the viral genome into the host cell. Some viruses, such as herpes simplex virus, Sendai virus, and human immunodeficiency virus, appear to be capable of direct fusion at the plasma membrane after initial attachment –. However, the majority of enveloped viruses use endocytosis for uptake and transport prior to fusion. Since endocytic cargo may eventually end up in the destructive environment of the lysosome, environmental cues are crucial to trigger viral fusion at the right stage of trafficking. These triggers, which may include a decrease in pH, changes in redox environment, and proteolytic activity –, induce conformational changes in the viral fusion proteins leading to the merger of viral and host membranes. Two well-studied viruses; influenza A virus (IAV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), are known to undergo fusion upon exposure to low pH –.

As depicted, the drug occupies a CCR5 pocket, blocking its interaction with GP120.\nModes of Protein Interaction\nPPIs commonly rely on large interfaces, whilst transient ones involve short linear peptides, as sequence motifs composed of 15 residues or less (Segura-Cabrera et al., 2013). Proteins that show a wide range of binding partners are called “hubs.” Hubs having only few interfaces are likely to interact transiently with different partners at different times (date hubs; Han et al., 2004), usually via domain–motif interactions (Franzosa and Xia, 2011). Conversely, proteins showing multiple interfaces tend to establish simultaneous interactions with multiple partners. Such proteins (party hubs) are likely to arrange themselves in complexes, via stable DDIs (Han et al., 2004).\nDue to their mode of interaction and number of interface residues, party hubs tend to evolve slowly, as changes in their residues are likely to impair some interactions with specific partners (Fraser et al., 2002). The opposite scenario is observed among proteins that establish transient interactions, which usually evolve faster (Teichmann, 2002). Interestingly, most viral proteins interfering with cell signaling and regulatory pathways perform transient interactions with host proteins (Perkins et al., 2010), leading to severe changes in cellular metabolism (Segura-Cabrera et al., 2013). Unfortunately, compared to stable (domain–domain) interactions, transient (domain–motif) interactions are under-represented in PPI databases, mainly due to limitations associated with the methods used so far to obtain protein–protein interaction data (Russell et al., 2004).", "score": 0.819474101, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:4c183e8a-366c-499c-9d01-2b901c27d01f>", "text": "A higher and more goal way to determine cytopathic effects is required.

Publishers nonetheless praise such ‘lift and shift’ services because they are well suited to clients who are reluctant to adopt ERP products in SaaS mode but still want to take advantage of the scalability and management peace of mind that a cloud infrastructure brings.\nThe multitenant on-demand offering is the purest form of cloud (SaaS).\nThis is followed by the ‘monotenant on-demand’ model, where each customer has their own instance of the ERP software that runs on the vendor’s platform. In this ‘single-tenant SaaS’ model, the customer continues to have the scalable computing power and the flexibility of subscription pricing, but their data and ERP system is kept separate from other customers. Some companies choose this option for their security and confidentiality reasons or to meet the countries’ legal compliance in which they operate.\nThe two types of SaaS ERP (multitenant and single-tenant) are often hosted in a public cloud. The infrastructure and services depend on a provider other than the ERP publisher.\nThe third significant type of cloud ERP is the ‘private cloud.’ Monotenant SaaS is often one of them. In private cloud ERP, the software and hardware are those of a single customer. In some cases, the ERP client even exercises some control over the data center and does not delegate all the host’s responsibilities. A private cloud ERP can even run on-site within the walls of the client company. Rather than cloud, we could therefore speak of ERP in ‘hosted and managed mode.’\nIt is possible to combine private cloud and public cloud for an ERP, depending on the modules and layers. The same is right in the public cloud-only, where multitenant may be relevant for some layers and not for others.

When the buyer is at the evaluation stage of the journey, you can help customers realize that your software is the answer to their problems and that it is the best choice on the market by publishing content that answers the questions and concerns they may have. For instance, when the buyer is going through the software evaluation process, you could publish a software buyer guide that informs the buyer of the pros and cons of similar software products on the market.\nJust as we take stock of what we want and need when buying a car, and then research each vehicle before heading to the car dealers, buyers will conduct over 60% of their research online before contacting a seller. According to TechTarget 65% of IT buyers will consume at least four pieces of content before contacting the vendor, and the 2014 B2B Buyer Behavior Survey from Demand Gen states that over 61% of buyers will choose the vendor that supplied relevant information at each stage of their journey.\nIt’s all about building trust in your product and company. Therefore, it makes sense to invest on inbound marketing content that provides the research material your customers are searching for.\nMarketing software can help you manage your inbound marketing strategy.\nMarketing software can help you plan your content, meet deadlines and coordinate your team to develop content that is specific to buyers at each stage of the funnel.\nThe software will also help track engagement and the progression of buyers through the funnel, which helps you create and repurpose content and send the information to the buyer just when they need it most.\nSelecting a channel partner to work with can be hugely valuable in amplifying your message and increasing your reach.

However, it is important to choose a sales channel that suits your business model, and even better if the channel you choose adds value for your potential customer and can help you guide them through the software buying process.\nThere are three common types of channel relationships that SaaS companies can use. Cost, flexibility and market adaptability are three major factors that will determine which channel to choose, and you need to understand which channel relates best to your customers’ requirements. The three sales channels are:\nApplication Developer Model\nThe Application Developer Model is slightly different in that the vendor directly supports the customer and the customer pays the vendor. However, a third party can help the customer set up or customize the vendor’s software. For example, Zoho CRM sells its service directly to customers and customers pay them directly.\nBrokerage Channel Model\nThe Brokerage Channel Model helps customize software for customers. This may entail bundling or stacking software to customize a solution for customers; this method can also include account management. It’s similar to an insurance broker sourcing and building a policy for you and works best for simple SaaS products that focus on high transactional requirements.\nValue Added Reseller (VAR)\nVAR provides customers with a fully customized software service. The reseller builds, operates, services and supports and also invoices the customer. The reseller will then pay a license fee or royalties back to the vendor or in some cases the customer can pay the license fee directly to the vendor.\nFor example, Roketto is a HubSpot Certified Partner, which means that we can sell HubSpot Licenses to our clients. Clients who buy a HubSpot license through Roketto are usually going to work with us for inbound marketing services, and the Hubspot software helps us in our service delivery, marketing strategy and with measuring and tracking results.\nAnd because Roketto is a VAR certified partner with Hubspot, we can provide them with a special link that lets them save money on the regular $3000 onboarding fee.

Cloud RPA frees the organizations from the related costs and time to operate and maintain infrastructure, significantly reducing the time to value.\nCloud deployment also opens the door for an accelerated pace of innovation, which is true of the RPA industry, with more capabilities delivered more frequently than ever before that are pushed directly to the automation environment. And that means dealing with change at an accelerated rate: adding new capabilities or even systems. How good or bad the change experience is, how seamless or disruptive it becomes, depends on the organization’s ability to handle change—whether it has resources and processes in place—and the automation technology provider the organization selects.\nFor the individual user, change is simply a matter of taking what a provider offers when it’s offered and working with the change: enjoying the new capabilities and/or dealing with issues such as a new way of using the solution or handling compatibility challenges. For an enterprise-class organization, that change effect is multiplied by the number of users, business applications within the organization, and the complexity of the solution and business. A disruption caused by change can have a significant effect on an organization’s continuity and bottom line.\nHow does an organization keep up with the pace of change to improve productivity and still provide a stable and non-disruptive automation environment to the different center of excellence (COE) automation leads to keep operations running round the clock? With so much to risk, many organizations have adopted a change management approach to handling updates for ensuring a successful implementation.\nWhat is change management?\nChange management can take many forms. But in terms of technology, according to CIO, it’s “the process for reviewing, approving, testing, and installing a new piece of equipment, a cloud instance, or a new release of an application.”\nIt’s important that an organization have a dedicated team to handle releases and promote the value of change for securing acceptance with users across the enterprise.

A wide variety of existing programming languages with their own strong and weak sides, frameworks, libraries, and other development tools allow creating applications of different types: for desktops, for mobile devices, web applications that work via browser, etc. Different software development methodologies and frameworks like Scrum or Kanban will help you adapt the development process for various types of projects, reduce costs, eliminate risks, and use the available resources more efficient. But besides the development itself, there’s another important issue that requires close attention. We’re talking about the way of licensing and delivering the software.\nWhen there’s a need to choose what framework, technology, or a programming language should be used during the development process, in most cases, the development company makes the final decision and the customer relies on the developer’s experience and skills. But the chosen software delivery model affects both the customer and the developer because different models have different pros and cons and require different development strategy.\nIn this article, we’ll talk about one of the existing software licensing and delivery models named Software as a Service, or SaaS, to be short, and the key benefits it offers.\nWhat is SaaS?\nSaaS is a centrally hosted software that is provided to a customer in the form of a service on a subscription basis. The applications of such kind run on the servers of SaaS providers and users can access them via browsers. Instead of buying an application, a user pays a “rent” that allows him to use it for a certain amount of time. Thus, users can decrease the use cost, which is one of the primary benefits of using SaaS. There’s no need for a user to think about the technical issues since the SaaS provider takes care of it.\nLet’s continue with the main SaaS advantages and benefits for a customer.\nMain Advantages and Benefits for Customer\nWhen we talk about an application without singling out specific features, we usually mean in-house software, software that was created for using within the organization. In this case, the customer is responsible for the support of hardware, databases, storage, security issues, and other important aspects of successfully running application. As you can imagine, this approach entails high costs due to the necessity for a team of IT specialists and regular expertise.\nFor a small business or state-owned enterprises, this may become a headache.

Cloud Strategies can provide an independent assessment of a software company’s SaaS strategy for investors and boards, or work directly with the company to maximize its opportunity for success. Cloud Strategies can work at a high level providing an assessment and recommendations in an advisory role, or become an integral part of the company team to make their SaaS Business Work.\nSaaS Company Profiles\nThe SaaS delivery and business models encompass a very wide variety of types of companies. The SaaS strategy will vary greatly, dependent on five primary characteristics of the SaaS company.\nGreenfield or Established Businesses\nStart-ups have the advantage of a clean slate, but don’t have the resources, image recognition, or channels of established players. Existing software vendors have many advantages, but the transition to SaaS can create competition with their existing products, additional working capital requirements, and issues with their existing channel.\nLow or High Price Offering\nMany basic SaaS products like Dropbox have a base edition that is free and entice their customers to move up to a paid version costing $5 to $10 per user per month. SaaS products vary in price from a few dollars per month for products like QuickBooks Online at around $30 to $60 per month to enterprise products such as NetSuite or Saleforce generally cost around $50 per seat per month with a wide variation up or down depending on the features. Some high-value, specialized SaaS products may cost as much as $600 per month. Services costs add significantly to the total cost of implementation in large, complex systems. The strategies and tactics for these SaaS offerings vary widely based on their price.\nDegree of Services Required\nSimple SaaS products have essentially no setup, or may have a minimum end user configuration such as setting up file locations for Dropbox. SaaS products have “Customer Self-Service” as a key attribute, allowing the company and the user to perform more of the setup operations for moderately complex products such as QuickBooks Online.

But as with all important topics, it isn't easy to get it right. To help you figure I researched pricing for two days. Here are my learnings.\nWe even build a little tool that lets you compare different pricing scenarios. This way you can figure out which pricing is suitable for your business.\nDifferent pricing models\nThe different pricing models I'll cover today aren't mutually exclusive. The most common practice is to combine multiple models together. This way you can build the right bundles for your customers. Something that's done pretty well by Hubspot. They combine users, features & freemiums into packages suitable for every customer. But now let's take a look at what pricing could be suitable for you:\nFlat pricing is pretty straightforward. You pay X amount of money in a certain period. The most common are monthly and yearly. No hidden fees, no strings attached.\nPro: Transparency. The customer knows exactly what to expect. It, therefore, is pretty trustworthy.\nCon: Regardless if a user uses your product 10x as often as another user both pay the same amount of money. Therefore some users will love it while it seems expensive to others.\nUser count is something often used by bigger SaaS companies offering products for entire teams. The logic behind it: The bigger the team the higher the revenue. Something that is the case more times than it’s not. There are two common approaches. Either every new user needs a new license or you go with the team-based approach. Having licences for up to 5 users, 10 users etc.\nPro: Every new customer can add growth to your MRR if they grow themselves. Having implemented the solution already they aren’t super likely to switch.\nCon: Other builders might see this as an opportunity to attract customers with better pricing for their size. Also, every license-based SaaS has seen accounts with only one user that is actually 2 or more people. It can be an annoyance to teams with some users who barely have to use the software but still need an account.\nCharging based on features is something for very diverse SaaS products. As with user count pricing models it’s often used by large players.

Finally, for SaaS products that are not fully configurable, or for very complex operations, some customization may be required in modules that interface to SaaS products.\nSaaS sales models vary widely, but all are more internet focused. Freemium models are common for low cost products which can provide a base level of functionality at no cost, ideally paid for by advertising revenue. The intent is to provide sufficient value to “up-sell” to the paid version, typically costing $10 or less per month. These SaaS products are sold by “no-touch” internet sales and marketing. Products that are somewhat higher priced rely on internet marketing supported sales with the potential for online chat. Enterprise SaaS products are sold directly or through a channel, due to their complexity and likely services component. These Enterprise SaaS products are heavily supported by internet marketing which helps educate the customer and reduce the direct sales costs.\nStrategies vary greatly depending on the horizontal or vertical market served. Different markets have differing propensities to move to SaaS and different competitive landscapes. Generally SMB markets have a greater demand for SaaS with the desire to reduce in-house IT complexity, a reduced need for customization, and reduced integration requirements. Certain vertical markets such as medical and financial have greater security, up-time, and compliance requirements which may increase the time to move to a SaaS solution. Consumers are now very comfortable with “applications in the cloud”, and do not have a “switching cost” from current applications. Consumer markets are most cost conscious and can be highly competitive.

That's an exaggeration, but today's savvy ISOs are negotiating agent relationships with value added resellers (VARs) or independent software vendors (ISVs). In this article, I'll highlight some of the legal issues around these relationships, which are becoming central to the ISO business.\nSo what is a VAR or ISV anyway? There is no official industry definition of these terms, but in plain language, VARs and ISVs already sell something to merchants who might have merchant accounts with ISOs.\nAs an example, consider a dentist practice management software-as-a-service (SaaS) provider that has a portfolio of a few hundred dental clinics. Through its SaaS, this ISV helps dentists maintain client records, set appointments, communicate with patients and create invoices. This ISV may see value in adding payments to its own offerings or at least in integrating to the payment services of a given processor or ISO.\nOnce that integration is technically possible, the ISV can easily solicit its dentists to offer them payments with the unparalleled convenience of the payment services working hand-in-glove (pun intended) with the SaaS dentist platform. From the point of view of the ISO, this ISV adds value to the resale of merchant services, and they are therefore a value-added reseller (VAR).\nIt's best not to get hung up on jargon, because it often changes, and different people will understand jargon to have different meanings. It's perhaps best to understand the roles of the various parties and use acronyms that they like to use for themselves.\nTwo factors drive ISVs and VARs to also want to sell processing: profit and competition.\nThe profit incentive is straightforward, as payment processing gives them a chance to participate in an entirely new revenue stream that is separate from their original business objectives. The ISV/VAR looks at their merchant customers the way others do: as sources of revenue with an associated cost of acquisition.\nAdding payments to an existing portfolio has a relatively low cost of acquisition for both the ISV/VAR and the processor behind it. In fact, in the contemporary landscape it probably costs more—from the supply side and also the merchant's purchasing side—to procure payments in a way that is not integrated with the merchant's core operating platform.\nCompetition as a motivator is more complex.", "score": 0.01095141083145412, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:2a321bae-505f-42c5-a8d5-09659ed00186>", "text": "Our SaaS development company offers the most reasonable price for high-quality SaaS development services.

Where Blade Runner’s success is with relatable public space, Rear Window’s is with private, regarding the relationships between locked rooms and their as equally locked residents. This compartmentalisation of characters and plotlines within separate rooms, either conjoining or across a courtyard builds an innate tension, in turn breeding paranoia and perversion, leading Hitchcock to subvert his own created worlds; building in methods of spying and having characters enter and leave rooms through non-traditional modes.\nAlfred Hitchcock – Rear Window\nHitchcock doesn’t limit this to Rear Window, in Psycho, Norman spies on Marion as she undresses via a peephole in his parlour wall, a symptom of the psychosis yet to be revealed.

Many of the apartments also benefited from running water and electricity, and could be lived in, if so desired.\nAlfred Hitchcock – Rear Window\nHaving created the world of Rear Window in line with real world architecture, for Hitchcock to then invert the rules of how architecture is used in the real world throws the audience. Windows become doorways: traditional means of accessing the outside world, they now become the means of access to the occupants and their secrets, both voyeuristically and physically, with characters climbing in and falling out of them. Private rooms become public spaces, with their inhabitants chained to their separate miseries: Miss Lonelyhearts trapped in her empty apartment, the nameless songwriter trapped in his bustling one – both looking for the same thing.

We move among it, inhabit it; it’s our beehive, our bird’s nest and so it becomes largely invisible to many of us. And yet, in the cinematic world the opposite seems true. We marvel, we run, we creep with our heroes and villains, through architectural landscapes.\nThink of the wondrous scenes that take place in Hogwarts (Harry Potter 1-8) or the playful ones in the eponymous setting of The Grand Budapest Hotel. Now think of how many times you felt a creeping sense of fear as Danny peddled his trike through the empty corridors of the Overlook Hotel in The Shining, or Captain Dallas squeezing himself along the claustrophobic air ducts of the Nostromo in Alien. Through these few examples it is clear that the surroundings of our characters, as well as their predicaments, help shape our emotional response.\nWes Anderson – Grand Budapest Hotel\nArchitecture also drives plot.

Back lighting and fill lighting are kept to a minimum, resulting in sharp, angular shadows cast ominously on the wall and ceiling above Norman.\nHitchcock also deftly uses camera angles to reveal all the audience needs to know about the troubled mind of Norman Bates. As he did with the lighting, Hitchcock shapes the scene in terms of contrasts. We see Marion sitting comfortably in her chair, leaning slightly forward, enjoying a sandwich Norman has made for her. Hitchcock places the camera near eye level so the audience sees Marion as two people might see each other while sitting and talking. There is nothing unusual in this. In fact, this particular angle provides the audience with a sense of normalcy and comfort in Marion's presence. Hitchcock, however, moves out of the comfort zone to shoot Norman from an unnaturally low perspective. These two camera angles in-and-of themselves mean nothing. Only when they are juxtaposed can any meaning be taken. The shift to Norman's angle suggests that Norman's world is skewed, off balance, out of kilter. We feel uncomfortable in this position because we are not used to viewing the world from such an angle and to do so makes it difficult to extract meaning.\nIn Norman's parlor, we usually see Marion from the front, so her full face is in view.\nHowever, the camera frequently moves to the left side of Norman, obscuring his other side.\nHitchcock's mise-en-scene probably does more to capture the intent of the characters than any one element in the entire scene. It also emphasizes the duality that exists not only within Norman Bates but within all of us. For instance, Marion is surrounded by scenic details that make her a sympathetic character, not without flaw--after all, she did steal forty thousand dollars-- but certainly not one to condemn too harshly.

Thank you to Alfred Hitchcock for providing such wonder visions of her in “Rear Window”. Now, back to the topic at hand.\nGoing to the movies and watching a film is, at its very heart, a voyeuristic activity. We sit and watch other people’s lives and stories from afar framed by the screen and form opinions and cast judgements on what we are watching. Alfred Hitchcock throws that voyeurism in our faces with “Rear Window”.\n“Rear Window” is a great example of what a master director with a master editor can accomplish. We watch a mostly point-of-view presentation of how a story is created in one’s mind and how that story can infect others that surround a character. We watch as L.B. Jefferies, confined to his wheelchair, becomes involved in the other lives of his neighbors as he voyeuristically watches their lives unfold, framed by the windows of their apartments.\nWe watch “Jeff” as he watches his neighbors and we become consumed by what he is seeing through classic A-B-A editing. A: We see him watching something. B: We cut to see what he is seeing. A: We cut back to get his reaction to what he is seeing. As the Bordwell reading stated, “the Kuleshov effect operates here: Our mind connects the two parts of space”, Jeff’s apartment and the courtyard, without the use of an establishing shot. This sequence of cuts is repeated over and over again to develop the movie-like story of his neighbors where he forms his opinions and casts judgements on what he is seeing and hearing. Given the lack of details, he fills in the gaps by coming to his own conclusions based purely on his visual input from afar. This is the Kuleshov effect on the part of Jeff himself. He connects the dots in his own mind based simply on what he sees and hears while he watches the movie of his neighbors unfold.\nFor me, “Rear Window” was a film of a man watching a movie of his neighbors. Each window in the courtyard presents a screen for us to voyeuristically watch as Jeff also voyeuristically watches his neighbors progress through their everyday lives and, oh yes, commits murder.", "score": 0.829186916, "source": "dense"}]}

Alfred Hitchcock’s psycho was first screened in 1960, where it instantly became a box- office success, and one of the most influential horror movies of all time, showing explicit violent and sexual scenes which shocked audiences worldwide, and breaking new ground for mainstream Hollywood film.\nIt transformed Hitchcock into a prestigious film director and the ‘mother’ of horror films. Its themes stuck at many American morals and were even blamed for causing severe murders, creating concerns of connections between screen violence and anti-social behaviour, which is still debated to this day.Alfred Hitchcock uses duality from the very opening seconds of the film, to reflect the whole theme of the film, of a split double personality.\nHitchcock’s idea of the black and white contrast, which was originally thought of to reduce the costs, also added to the duality of the film. This also went well with the chillingly screeching music which had a sharp staccato rhythm and slashing strings which created contrast and also added to the tension, suspense and intrigue in the shower scene, the slashing and screaming of Marion. The credits are also split and formed to merge into one whole ‘person’ portraying the duality of the characters in Psycho.\nHitchcock makes use of camera angles, which is effectively shown when Marion is in the car, running away from her fear. The camera is focused through her eyes and shows her looking away from her own reflection as the mirror, which mirrors her dual personality; another effective technique that Hitchcock uses to present the theme of duality in Marion. Norman Bates’ face is almost half covered most of time by the darkness and camera angles which Hitchcock uses, to portray the split personality in Norman Bates, which is his mother. Only at the closing stages of the story, do the audience realize that Bates has two distinct identities, himself and his mother, and that the two personality are continually fighting over the little sanity that is left in Norman Bates, which Bates reveals when dressing as his mother. The mirrors in the motel also work effectively reflecting Norman Bates’ image to show the dual personality in Norman.The language used in psycho also allows Hitchcock to play with the audiences’ assumption of the split personality e.g.\nWhen Norman says: ‘We all go a little mad sometimes.’ Hitchcock uses the theme of predator versus prey to build upon the audiences fear towards Bates.", "score": 0.826190948, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:cdf85bba-d358-4bd4-9891-93111acb7412>", "text": "Marion’s eyes study the furniture of the room. Stuffed birds make up most of the furniture. Hitchcock often used birds as symbols. Most famously in “The Birds” where at the beginning of the picture we witness birds trapped in their cages. By the end of the film it’s the other way around with humans trapped in a house and the birds outside. The purpose of stuffed birds in “Psycho” has been interpreted several times. Norman explains that stuffing birds is his hobby; we later learn that he stuffed his own mother. One of the birds is an owl waving her wings symbolizing the furious side of his split personality (or his mother side); the calm crow is his calmer side (Norman side), or maybe they’re just there to disturb the viewer and place them in an uncomfortable surrounding.\nAfter learning more about Norman’s taxidermy hobby, the conversation takes us deeper into his personality. Taxidermy is supposed to “pass the time not fill it” I can imagine the work, stuffing birds, and his own mother over and over using expensive chemicals. Poor Norman. One of the most disturbing lines follows expressing the oddness of this disturbed character: “Well, a boy’s best friend is his mother.” Moments later, Norman asks Marion where she’s heading. “I didn’t mean to pry”, he utters apologetically. Another humorous line, for Norman does pry in the scene that follows, not verbally though; he does it physically through a peephole.\nDuring the course of this scene, the viewer is exposed to Psycho’s finest moment, a priceless exchange of dialogue. Through their connection we slowly remove our feet from Marion’s shoes and step into Norman’s shoes. The focus now is on Norman and his mother. After, Norman expressing the courses of his daily life with no friends and him putting up with his mother, Marion suggests he send her to a madhouse. A medium shot of Norman changes to a close up, not through a cut but by him moving forward to face the lens. He snaps at her. “We all go a little mad sometimes.”\nAt the end of the scene we learn that Marion changes her mind and decides to return the money the next morning.

In 1871, Germany officially became a unified country. This time, we’ll look at the cultural ramifications of the unification and how it impacted art.\nAlthough German-speaking princes had been allied for centuries, the individual provinces needed to strengthen their commitment in order to counter military and economic competition from other countries such as Austria and France. But just because the people in the new country spoke German and shared much in the way of their cultural identity didn’t mean that they felt like a big happy family. And the disruptive forces of the industrial revolution did nothing to help the sense of confusion and frustration.\nThe people of the German Empire needed to ask themselves: what does it mean to be German? The imagery on Mettlach steins of the time offers some interesting answers to that question.\nSome steins use inspiration from the distant past for their subject matter. This shows a pride in the traditions of German culture—with roots back to the middle ages—as well as nostalgia for a simpler time. This past is often called “altdeutschen” or “old Germany”. When it appears in art, it is called historicism.\nFor instance, at the beginning of this post is a beautiful stein that shows a medieval knight mounted on a majestic white horse enjoying a tankard of beer. The romantic notion of the past is echoed in the lid in the shape of a castle turret.\nThis large-scale pitcher shows successful German hunters in extravagant Renaissance dress—just look at that ermine trim! The man on this side is toasted by none other than the ancient goddess of the hunt, Diana, who sits on top of a beer barrel.\nA noble couple in elegant dress from the 16th century is featured on this pitcher. The traditions of the past are celebrated by the man who is practicing falconry, using the bird of prey to hunt.\nHistoricism is not the only way that steins reveal the German exploration of identity. National symbolism can be seen in this Mettlach stein. The Imperial Eagle of Germany is front and center.\nThere is further pride in German modernity: This stein celebrates two very important technological developments that Germany embraced: the telegraph and the railroad.

Instead, over its long past, what is now known as Germany was once states, principalities, kingdoms and more. With its often divided presence, many people tried to unite the country, including Charlemagne of the Holy Roman Empire. In the 9th century, Charlemagne was successful in ruling over a large territory that included modern day Germany, yet it was not strong enough to last and within a single generation, the power of the territory was merely symbolic.\nThe 14th century proved disastrous not only for a fragmented Germany but for all of Europe. Wars and the Black Plague wiped out between 30-60% of the continent’s population. In the 15th century, the Habsburgs were successful in securing a hold on the Holy Roman Emperor which would last into the 19th century. Unfortunately the empire’s various territories were constantly at odds with each other thus preventing the unity that had occurred in France and England.\nThe Reformation, an incredibly important period in European history, was born in Germany when Martin Luther posted his 95 Theses to the town square. Luther hoped to highlight corruption in the Catholic Church and as a result, his desire for change sparked the Reformation that spread quickly across the continent. The next two centuries witnessed the Scientific Revolution and many great thinkers emerged from Germany like Nicholas Copernicus and Johannes Kepler.\nThe 19th century was a time of change for Germany as the desire for unification grew. Tired of several states, each with their own ruler and even currency, much of the population sought nationhood. The March Revolution erupted in 1848 but was ultimately unsuccessful as King Friedrich Wilhelm VI rejected a united nation because it would threaten his power. However, unification was inevitable and occurred more than two decades later in 1871, after the Franco-Prussian war. This unification was ushered in by Otto von Bismarck who helped to maintain peace in Europe until 1914.\nThe First World War was a massive conflict from 1914 to 1918 between the Allies (Britain, France and Russia) and the Central Powers (Germany and Austria-Hungary).

Gas lighting was introduced; omnibus services began in 1828; and Paris got its first railway, which ran to Le Pecq, near Saint-Germain-en-Laye, in 1837. New districts grew up on the outskirts of Paris. Although the wall of the farmers-general remained the administrative boundary of Paris until 1859, it was decided in 1840 to refortify the capital with a longer military wall.\nEven by the mid-19th century, some areas of Paris had not been improved substantially for hundreds of years.

Haussmann was the creator of modern Paris. A planner on the grand scale, he advocated straight arterial thoroughfares, symmetry, and advantageous vistas. He slashed the boulevards through the tangles of slums, began the modern sewer and water systems, gutted the Île de la Cité, rebuilt the ancient market of the Halles, and added four new Seine bridges and rebuilt three old ones.

One of them, the Sorbonne, became a fountainhead of theological learning with Albertus Magnus and St. Thomas Aquinas among its scholars. The university community constituted an autonomous borough; another was formed on the right bank by merchants ruled by their own provost. In 1358, under the leadership of the merchant provost Etienne Marcel, Paris first assumed the role of an independent commune and rebelled against the dauphin (later Charles V).

Why did you move to France in 1989? New York was already the center of the art world among other things at that time, what made you decide upon Paris?\nLee Bae. I was thinking to work on my art outside of Korea for a long time. To leave a place that one has become familiar with is an act of desire out of fundamental human will to objectively look at one’s Self. In the beginning, I visited New York many times for a possibility to settle there. America definitely has many lively sectors, and I really felt their strengths. However, if I may say so, art felt more commercial than being art itself. There, I felt as if the artist were simply lingering on the market grounds. New York was undoubtedly the most important place for art and other sectors, but I was afraid of settling in an market-like place. So I agonized over where was a suitable place I could go to construct my art and mature myself as an artist. I felt this was possible in Paris, and so I moved there. Time passed, and so I stayed. Looking back, I really feel that Paris was good for my artistic development.\nShim Eunlog. In Korea, you created colorful abstractions using paints. Once you moved to Paris, you began monotone works from charcoal. What caused this change?\nLee Bae. When I made drawings in Paris, I used a slender stick of charcoal, but I was not fully satisfied with it, so I bought a whole bag of charcoal for grill. As I drew with charcoal, I was fascinated by its texture, and also brought me back to the very first time I began painting. An artwork I made very early on was made of mashed up charcoal made to look like a drawing. Even if charcoal is common and shabby matière, it can deepen in its meaning if it matches well with the artist and connects with his artistic sensibilities. If the artist can find a material he resonates with, and spends a long time with it, that material can stand out as a projection of the artist’s image. There was also a financial reason for using charcoal. Paints were particularly expensive, and charcoal was comparatively very cheap – and I could use one bag of charcoal for a really long time.\nSim Eunlog.", "score": 0.04964906924165453, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:5ad963f8-b3e3-476c-b61b-ed5a901dc061>", "text": "On a quiet stretch of Christopher Street near the Hudson River, the New Ohio Theatre not only found a new home in the historic Greenwich Village Archive Building but a partner in fostering theater companies. With IRT Theater, which shares space in the red-brick building, the downtown Manhattan theater mainstay will, on Oct. 8, launch the Archive Alliance Residency program, which promises to emphasize incubating theater companies instead of specific works.\nAs part of the two-year residency, up to four independent theater companies will be offered two separate engagements in IRT’s 3B Development Series and a one-week presentation in the New Ohio’s Obie Award–winning Ice Factory summer festival. In the second year of the program, the companies will be given a four-week run in the New Ohio’s main season.\n“We aren’t really curating a project per se. We are investing in the company and saying to them, ‘We like who you are and what you are doing,’ ” said the New Ohio artistic director Robert Lyons. “We’re taking a big leap of faith with them. There is a significant commitment on our part, and that is somewhat unique in residencies.... There is a lot of freedom and security for the company; that is what we are trying to provide them.”\nThe idea for IRT and the New Ohio’s collaboration was born almost a year ago, when Lyons first found himself in the Christopher Street space, which was poised for a massive renovation. The previous incarnation of the New Ohio Theatre, called the Ohio Theatre and before that the Ohio Performance Space, operated for more than 20 years at 66 Wooster St. in SoHo. In 2010 the group lost its lease but eventually, with the help of the city, found a home in the Greenwich Village Archive Building. Shortly after the New Ohio moved in, IRT artistic director and curator Kori Rushton stopped by to welcome Lyons to the neighborhood. As the pair talked, they realized they knew many of the same theater companies. After six months of informal discussions, Lyons and Rushton found themselves in a restaurant across the street from their theaters, formally solidifying the partnership that would become the Archive Alliance Residency.\n“There is a naturally complementary relationship,” Lyons said. “We are a presenter organization, and they primarily have residencies and develop works.", "score": 0.02967187548873136, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:0cb02b46-9ac5-46e6-a9e6-723541b54498>", "text": "Everybody's a photographer, everybody's a filmmaker, and it's not like that, it is a profession, a savoir-faire and not faire-savoir… Sorry I had to!

Brady and Danielle Moyer, MS\nThe occurrence of fibromyalgia is 10 to 20 times higher in women than in men . Those women are also more likely than men to have severe tender points of pain, “pain all over”, sleep disturbances, and fatigue .\nThe incidence of Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) is higher in women when compared to men. Internationally, the prevalence of IBS is 67% higher in women .\nAnxiety disorders are more than twice as likely to occur in women when compared to men .\nThe question is: why?\nThough the reasons are still being studied, research suggests that an interaction between biology, psychology, and sociocultural factors leads to higher occurrences of these diseases in women . Of particular interest is the role of women’s hormonal and nervous systems, which respond somewhat differently to stress and trauma than those of men .\nResearch by the American Psychological Association looked at 290 studies between 1980 and 2005 to determine if men or women were more at risk for potentially traumatic events and PTSD (Post-traumatic Stress Disorder). The results concluded that, although men experience more traumatic events on average than women, women are more likely to meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD. PTSD is an anxiety disorder caused by a traumatic event and symptoms include “re-experiencing the trauma, avoidance and numbing and hyperarousal .” PTSD occurs in 10-12% of women and 5-6% of men, making the rate in women almost double . Women’s PTSD also tends to last longer (on average four years), whereas men’s lasts one year on average .\nThe types of trauma men and women experience are different as well. Men are more likely to experience trauma from natural disasters, human-caused disasters, accidents, and combat, whereas women are more likely to experience trauma from domestic violence, sexual abuse, and sexual assault . Sexual trauma has been shown to be particularly toxic to mental health, and can typically begin at a young age when the brain is still developing . This can impact a woman's fear and stress response well into adulthood.\nTrauma, stressors, and/or PTSD alter pain processing and incoming stimuli in an individual.

In systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), the prevalence of the disease is 9 times higher among women; however, the cause of this disparity is largely unknown, a recent study indicates.\nThe study, published in JCI Insight, examined the potential mechanisms promoting increased likelihood of autoimmunity in women as opposed to men. The study pointed to a skin-targeted overexpression of the female-biased transcription cofactor vestigial like family member 3 (VGLL3) as a potential contributor to autoimmunity. Previous research has indicated that women have more VGLL3 in their skin cells than men.\nAccording to the study, the researchers found that in mice, having too much VGLL3 in skin cells promoted an autoimmune response that extended beyond the skin. In the mouse model, overexpression of VGLL3 drove an autoimmunity-prone transcriptional signature similar to that observed in female skin, causing inflammation and activation of type I IFN signaling that mimics cutaneous lupus, according to the researchers.\nAdditionally, the researchers noted that extra VGLL3 in the skin cells appeared to change expression levels of a number of genes important to the immune system, including many of the same genes altered in autoimmune diseases. In mice with excess VGLL3, their skin became scaly and raw and they produced antibodies against their own tissues.\n“VGLL3 appears to regulate immune response genes that have been implicated as important to autoimmune diseases that are more common in women, but that don’t appear to be regulated by sex hormones,” lead study author Johann Gudjonsson, MD, PhD, professor of dermatology at the University of Michigan Medical School, said in a press release. “Now, we have shown that overexpression of VGLL3 in the skin of transgenic mice is by itself sufficient to drive a phenotype that has striking similarities to systemic lupus erythematosus, including skin rash, and kidney injury.”\nThe researchers concluded that the data support the assertion that overexpression of VGLL3 in female skin primes women for autoimmunity.

(7)\nThere are other hormonal factors to consider regarding the “over reactive” stress response in women. This stress response triggers the gene expression responsible for disrupting the endocrine system. That’s where significant problems begin.\nThe heightened stress response in women is generally considered to be a survival instinct. Women – as the reproductive gender – may need a higher rate of stress hormones to assure procreation.\nHowever, that heightened ability (at chronic levels) tips the scales into disruption, dysfunction, and the tendency toward disease. The resulting endocrine disruption increases the risk factors for thyroid dysfunction, glycemic dysregulation, diabetes, and more. (8)\n3) Immunity factors\nNow we get to the topic of the immune system and autoimmunity. Stress hormones affect the immune system by depressing or delaying response. Many people who deal with chronic health challenges report an impaired immune system and increased frequency of colds, flu, etc.\nThis is different from the over active immune response that leads to autoimmunity. Yet, they’re both part of the same equation. The immune system – and the risk for autoimmune predisposition – are definitely impacted by gender-related hormones.\nAccording to this National Institute of Health report, “It is well established that gender plays a profound role in the incidence of autoimmunity with diseases such as lupus occurring much more frequently in females than in males. This is related to higher numbers of circulating antibodies as well as other factors.” (9)\nThe good news is that once we’re aware of why risk factors may be increased for females, we’re now empowered with the information we need to take action and reduce our exposure to these risks.", "score": 0.851976216, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:813f0f54-20d5-410f-b6cd-fb820628d265>", "text": "Why do women live longer than men?\nBeing the bigger and stronger of the sexes, one might assume that men would normally live longer, healthier lives than women. The opposite is true, however. In the US, for example, women outlive men by an average of 5-7 years and, according to the World Health Organization in 2006, this pattern is true for all countries on earth.\nWhile lifestyle choices certainly play a role in the disparity, some researchers argue that genetics may also be a factor. After all, the tendency for females to outlive males applies not only to humans, but for all mammal species.\nFactors that may explain why women live longer than men\nSeveral biological theories are commonly mentioned:\n- The higher level of testosterone hormone in men leads them to engage in more violent or risky behavior.\n- Until menopause, the higher estrogen levels in women serves a protective function against \"bad\" LDL cholesterol. Thus, women generally tend to avoid the earlier signs of heart disease commonly seen in men.\n- Women tend to have lower iron levels through a significant portion of their life due to menstruation -- and iron, which comes primarily from meats in our diet, plays a strong role in the formation of cell-damaging and cell-aging free-radicals.\n- Because females have 2 X chromosomes (versus XY in males), defects in one chromosome may be offset by the other. (In birds, however, the chromosome variation is reversed: female birds have ZW chromosomes whereas males have the same ZZ. And, as a result, male tend to outlive females in most bird species.)\n+ Free Shipping & Returns on Eligible Items.\n(*Amazon's Top 100 list updated hourly.)\nA recent theory is that, in general, smaller individuals in a species live longer. Perhaps this is because their development involves fewer cell doublings and a reduced demand for ongoing tissue regeneration over a lifetime. Supporting this theory is the fact that age-related diseases generally appear earlier in men than in women.\nThis is probably where the dramatic differences between male and female longevity are determined:\n- Men tend to drink and smoke more.

Second, it appears that hormones affect RA risk and flares. Many women with RA who get pregnant experience fewer or no symptoms at all, only to find that they reappear after the baby is born.

Our immune system produces antibodies to fight against unwanted substances that are harmful for us. During an allergy, the body produces antibodies to fight off against substances that do not cause harm. This immune system reaction can trigger conditions such as inflammation of skin, nasal passages or the digestive system. This can be termed as an allergic reaction.\nIf the allergic reaction becomes severe enough to induce life threatening symptoms then it is referred to as an Anaphylaxis. During this condition a person experiences severe allergic reactions and if not treated in time, it may even result in death.\nA study has shown that women commonly, experience more severe allergic reactions than men owing to their estrogen hormones.\nStudies pertaining to anaphylaxis are difficult to perform because of its life threatening nature. About 200 people die from anaphylaxis every year in the United States, but these numbers could be bigger, because many people die from unrecognized anaphylaxis. A person may be suffering from heart disease and may die because of a heart attack, but it’s also possible that the attack may well have been induced by a severe allergic reaction.\nResearchers from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases NIAID have found that female mice are more prone to more severe anaphylactic reactions as compared to their male counterparts. They discovered that estradiol, which is an estrogen, enhances the activity of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), which produces some of the common symptoms that are attributed to anaphylaxis.\nOnly when plain eNOS is introduced into the system of the person undergoing anaphylaxis will result in the drop of blood pressure of the person, enabling the fluid in the blood vessels to leak into the surrounding tissue, which would in turn cause swelling. Adding estradiol would further cause the symptoms to become more pronounced than ever.\nResearchers in a bid to understand that whether estradiol was the real culprit blocked the estrogen in female mice. And the results showed that female mice experienced similar levels of allergic reactions as their male counterparts, thereby further strengthening the research.\nSo overall, the research concluded that gender factor does play an important role in allergies.\n“More women are admitted to hospitals for anaphylaxis as compared to men which indicates that something is going on here.

I think there are some women who would rather eat a worm than be compared to men. On the other end of that pole are those who gladly acknowledge the distinct strengths and weaknesses of both sexes and are grateful for the comparison. It’s likely that most of us with two X chromosomes fall somewhere in between the two extremes.\nAs far as our life experiences, I believe that a woman’s is not so different from a man’s in terms of the actual things that happen: love, marriage, children, death, career, friendship, education, etc.. It’s far more likely that the variance comes from the way we each react to a particular scenario. For example: it’s far more likely that a woman will show her emotions while experiencing a traumatic or an extremely joyful event. And though it’s perfectly acceptable for both sexes to do this, you just don’t see very many men tearing up when they watch their best friend get married. The thing is, these differences are hard-wired into our dna. Men have been the hunters and protectors since the beginning; of necessity they are less reactive to stressful situations. I mean, what if back then when the guys had to go find food they suddenly started crying hysterically when a big scary bear jumped out in front of them instead of killing it? I’m just saying…\nAnd, since I’m using hypothetical situations, here’s one starring a woman. What if back then when a woman had to give birth on her own, take care of that newborn without the help of Dr. Spock or new mommy blogs, suddenly just left the baby because she didn’t feel a connection with her? Not good… Sadly, this tragedy does happen. Thankfully, it’s not often.\nThe point to all this is just to be aware of our differences, especially when you’re trying to communicate to the opposite sex. I’m not just talking love relationships here. We have fathers, brothers, sons, male friends, co-workers, and clients. Men will always be different from women.

She points out that there is a significant difference in the types and amounts of germs that boys and girls are exposed to, leading her to the view that this might explain some of the health differences between men and women.\nDr Clough proposes that there should be new ways of looking at old studies. The ''hygiene hypothesis'' has linked the recent rise in asthma, allergies and autoimmune disorders such as Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis with particular geographical and environmental locations. Many studies have noted that as countries become industrialised and more urban, rates of these diseases rise. A good example is India, where rates of Crohn's disease are climbing as sanitation improves and industrialisation increases.\nIn the United States it is reported that asthma prevalence is 8.9% in females as opposed to 6.5% in males and autoimmune diseases strike three times as many women as men.

C.\nPublic Library of Science\n1 - 12\nItem Usage Stats\nMetadataShow full item record\nBackground: Autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) are characterized by a strong genetic susceptibility from the Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) locus. Additionally, disorders of epigenetic processes, in particular non-random X chromosome inactivation (XCI), have been reported in many female-predominant autoimmune diseases. Here we test the hypothesis that women with RA or SSc who are strongly genetically predisposed are less susceptible to XCI bias. Methods: Using methylation sensitive genotyping of the androgen receptor (AR) gene, XCI profiles were performed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 161 women with RA, 96 women with SSc and 100 healthy women. HLA-DRB1 and DQB1 were genotyped. Presence of specific autoantibodies was documented for patients. XCI skewing was defined as having a ratio ≥ 80:20 of cells inactivating the same X chromosome. Results: 110 women with RA, 68 women with SSc, and 69 controls were informative for the AR polymorphism. Among them 40.9% of RA patients and 36.8% of SSc patients had skewed XCI compared to 17.4% of healthy women (P = 0.002 and 0.018, respectively). Presence of RA-susceptibility alleles coding for the \"shared epitope\" correlated with higher skewing among RA patients (P = 0.002) and such correlation was not observed in other women, healthy or with SSc. Presence of SSc-susceptibility alleles did not correlate with XCI patterns among SSc patients. Conclusion: Data demonstrate XCI skewing in both RA and SSc compared to healthy women. Unexpectedly, skewed XCI occurs more often in women with RA carrying the shared epitope, which usually reflects severe disease.", "score": 0.18667204378341284, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:179fdc52-0be0-484b-a537-5c561f92b8f8>", "text": "Hypothyroidism And Autoimmune Disease - Is Als An Autoimmune Disease\nRealize that you can most likely experience a normal life without depression, pain, and fatigue.

The average car battery can last between 3-5 years, but the actual life of your battery depends on several factors.\n- The quality of the battery when first purchased. You don’t have to spend a fortune, but don’t be cheap about it.\n- How well you maintain it. Battery maintenance goes a long way toward longer life. Include your battery on your checklist whenever you take your car in for routine check ups. Don’t forget the cables and terminals and keep them clean.\n- The weather. Check the top of your battery to see the temperature specifications. If you live in a cold climate make sure you purchase one intended for your area. Cold weather reduces the cranking power of your battery so an older battery will experience more issues in the winter than a new one. Car batteries can even freeze and explode so if you think your battery is frozen proceed with caution.\n- Your car usage. Turn off all your car’s accessories before you turn off your car. The heater and A/C, radio, wipers, etc. can really drain your battery even when the car is off. Even consistently short trips can shorten battery life.\nAnd since it’s still the middle of winter we’ll pass on some more battery tips from our friends at AAA:\n- Turn off all accessories at night before turning the ignition switch off.\n- Make sure battery case and brackets are free of corrosion.\n- Keep the car in a garage overnight, if available.\n- Check the tension and condition of your fan belt. If it is loose, it can affect the battery’s ability to recharge.\n- Watch and listen for battery-drain warning signs. If headlights dim when idling but brighten when you rev the engine it could signal an electrical system problem. If you hear a grinding or clicking when you turn the ignition to the crank position, your battery may be weak\n- Lastly, if your battery does not initially turn the engine over on the first try in the morning, turn the ignition key on and wait one minute before cranking the engine again. This gives the battery chemicals time to jell and energize the battery terminals.\nIf you’re wondering if your battery is on its last legs bring your car into Sallas Auto Repair and we’ll be happy to check it as well as your car’s other systems.

Many sailors measure the amp-hours used for each electrical device, calculate their total electrical needs, and match this to battery capacity.\nHow do winches of different speeds affect battery drain?\nA Harken 2-speed winch drains less power from the battery because it offers the mechanical advantage of a second gear. A single-speed winch operates in the motor's upper range and draws more amps. Because line speed slows dramatically in the upper range, time of use is comparable to 2-speed, but amperage draw is greater.\nHow do I determine my battery requirements?\nCalculate the amount of electricity you need for all systems per charging period. Compare this number to your battery capacity. For optimal battery life and performance, your battery capacity should be three times the daily draw. For example, if electrical draw is 100 amp-hours per day, you will need 300 amp-hours of battery capacity.\nWhat is an amp-hour?", "score": 0.005339425852301788, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:22b1269a-dfb4-4548-b848-6c97bb17cf67>", "text": "In our article discussing Ah (ampere-hours) and Wh (watt-hours), we got a ton of questions about the longevity of batteries. The question “How long does a battery last?” was a predominant one. To help everybody trying to calculate how long will a battery last, we have created a Battery Life Calculator.\nIt’s quite useful knowing when a battery will die on us. Example: If we go camping and depend on batteries for all our power needs, and we have no other means of generating electricity.\nBefore we check out the Battery Life Calculator, let’s note that figuring out how long will a battery last is pretty simple in theory (in practice, it’s actually quite difficult). We use this equation for battery drain time:\nBattery Life (in hours) = Battery Capacity (in Ah) / Load Current (in A)\nWhat does ah mean on a battery? It just means amp-hours. 1 Ah is a current of 1 amp running for 1 hour.\nExample: How long will a 100 Ah (amp-hour) battery last if we hook it up to a 1 Ah electric device? Well, battery capacity = 100 Ah, load current = 1 A, thus such a battery will last for 100 Ah / 1 A = 100 hours.\nBasically, a 100 Ah battery means that such a battery can provide 100 A of current for 1 hour. It can also provide 1 A current for 100 hours. Or 0.1 A or 100 mA for 1000 hours.\nIt seems quite simple, right?\nIf you have 100 capacity units (100 Ah) and you connect it to a device that requires 1 capacity unit (1 A) every hour, it will drain the battery in precisely 100 hours.\nWhy Calculating The Battery Life Is Not Exactly Easy\nHere’s the deal:\nIn practice, we only need two numbers to calculate when the battery will die on us. These are:\n- Battery capacity (in Ah). This one is pretty easy to get; it’s written right on the battery. Typical AA battery has 2.5 Ah or 2500 mAh (milli-amp-hours) capacity, AAA battery has 1 Ah capacity, laptop battery has 2 Ah to 6 Ah, 100 Ah battery has Ah capacity, and so on. You can read more about battery capacities here.\n- Load Current or Amp Draw (in A).", "score": 0.003902483435829424, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:08ca2aa7-2fc9-4d83-ae35-ee73233a67f4>", "text": "If you have kids, you probably know this already, but lots of stuff needs batteries. Remote control toys, Wii remotes, laser pointers (well, that is for me), flash lights, even Nerf guns. For me, I have found the best place to pick up batteries is at one of these \"dollar\" stores. Sure the batteries are cheaper, but are they any good? Who knows. Let's find out.\nThe first way to look at the quality of a battery is to see how much stored energy is in it. How could you measure this? Well, here is how I did it. I took a battery and connected to a light bulb and let it run for as long as it could. Like this:\nWith this setup, I can measure both the current ( I ) from the battery and the electric potential ( ΔV ) across the battery. At any given instant in time, the power from the battery will be:\nPower tells me how fast the energy is changing, but not the total energy in the battery. In order to find the total energy, I can write the power like this:\nIf the current and the change in potential were constant for the whole time interval (Δt), this would be a fairly straightforward calculation. Alas, these are not constant. So what do I do? I cheat. If I instead look at a very short time interval, the current and potential do not really change too much. This means that I can reasonably calculate the energy during this short time. Then I just need to do this a whole bunch of times to get the total energy.\nAdding up a whole bunch of small pieces is called \"an integral\". In this case, I won't use calculus to evaluate an integral since I don't know a mathematical function for the power. Instead I will do it numerically with the following formula (by \"I will do\" I really mean \"make a computer do\"):\nAnd that is it. The total energy that the battery produced.\nVernier makes both a current and voltage probe for the LabQuest system. Collecting data was fairly simple (even though each battery would take quite some time). Here is the data from LoggerPro (Vernier's software):\nThis software can calculate both the power as well as integrate to find the total energy. But I am not going to do this.

If your battery dies unexpectedly, you could find yourself stranded out on the water.\nBut is there any way of knowing how long your battery may last?\nHow long will a marine battery run a trolling motor on a single charge?\nWhat factors can affect your battery’s run time?\nAnd is there any way to make a battery last longer between charges?\nIn this article, we’ll answer all of these questions and more.\nTable of Contents\n- How Long Does a Marine Battery Last on a Trolling Motor?\n- How Can I Calculate the Battery Run Time on a Trolling Motor?\n- Can I Make the Battery Last Longer?\nHow Long Does a Marine Battery Last on a Trolling Motor?\nThe question seems simple enough: how long can you expect your battery to last? How many hours of power will your trolling motor have per battery charge?\nUnfortunately, the simplest answer to this question is, it depends. Every battery and trolling motor is slightly different, and there are many different variables that may influence how long your battery is going to last.\nBecause of these variables, the same battery may run your trolling motor for a given amount of time on one boating trip and for a completely different amount of time on another trip.\nLet’s take a closer look at these variables.\nWhat Factors Impact the Run Time of a Marine Battery on a Trolling Motor?\nOne of the most important numbers when figuring battery run time is the amp hours, or Ah. This number should be given on all marine batteries. It denotes the amount of amperage the battery could supply over a given time period.\nFor example, let’s consider a marine battery with a 100Ah rating. Fully charged, and under perfect conditions, this battery could supply your trolling motor 100 amps of power for one hour, 50 amps for 2 hours, 25 amps for 4 hours, 10 amps for 10 hours, etc.\nAs you can see from the example above, how long the battery lasts depends on how many amps your trolling motor is consistently drawing from the battery. The lower the amp draw, the longer the battery will last.\nMarine batteries come with different amp hour ratings. Some have 50Ah or 75Ah ratings, many have 100Ah or 120Ah ratings, and some even have 200Ah ratings.", "score": 0.0012779076971516463, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:22b1269a-dfb4-4548-b848-6c97bb17cf67>", "text": "We have that; it’s 200 Ah.\n- Amp draw. That we don’t have; we have to calculate it.\nTo calculate amp draw (A) from watts (W), we also need to know the voltage (V). To calculate amps, we use the basic electric power equation:\nP (in W) = I (in A) * V (in V)\nBasically, electric power P (wattage) is calculated by multiplying electric current I (amps) with voltage V (volts). To calculate amps, you have to express the electric current I (amps) like this:\nI (in A) = P (in W) / V (in V)\nThis basically tells us that we get the amps by dividing watts by volts.\nExample: We have an 800 W AC unit that runs on a 120 V electric circuit. What’s the amp draw here? Easy, we just divide 800 W by 120 V and get 800W/120V = 6.67 A.\nIf you find this confusing a bit, you can use our watts to amps calculator here to help you out with the calculation.\nIn our example above, we have calculated the amp draw of the 800 W AC. It’s 6.67 A. Now we have both numbers; we have a 200 Ah battery and we know the AC has a 6.67 A draw. How long will a 200 Ah battery last if it has to power this AC? Let’s calculate:\n200 Ah Battery Life = 200 Ah / 6.67 A = 30 hours\nIn short, a 200 Ah battery will be able to power an 800 W 120 V air conditioner for about 30 hours.\nNow, it’s important that we feel the effect of different voltages. Let’s say that we have the same 200 Ah battery, the same power input 800 W unit, but it runs on a 240 V electrical circuit instead of a 120 V circuit.\nBecause the voltage is different, the amp draw – the amps required to run such an AC – will also change.", "score": 0.0008834788988426276, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:06ff274d-a810-4246-8d11-01aae0f3c26a>", "text": "- Can a solar panel overcharge a battery?\n- How long will a 100ah battery run a fridge?\n- How long will it take a 100 watt solar panel to charge a battery?\n- Where does solar go when batteries are full?\n- Do solar panels drain batteries at night?\n- What can I power with a 200 watt solar panel?\n- How much power can a 200 watt solar panel produce?\n- How fast will a 200 watt solar panel charge a 12-volt battery?\n- How long will a 200Ah battery last?\n- How many batteries do I need for 10000 watts?\n- What size solar panel do I need to charge a 12 volt battery?\n- Can you leave a solar trickle charger on all the time?\n- How many batteries do I need for a 2000 watt inverter?\n- How many solar panels and batteries do I need to run a refrigerator?\n- How many batteries is 5000 watts?\n- How many 12V batteries are needed to power a house?\n- How many solar panels do I need to run a TV?\n- How long will a 200W solar panel take to charge a battery?\n- How do you know if a solar panel is charging a battery?\n- How long do solar batteries hold their charge?\nCan a solar panel overcharge a battery?\nYes, when a solar panel is directly connected to the battery, then it can be overcharged.\nA 12 Volt solar panel can give an output of 21 Volts during peak sunlight.\nThe 12 Volt battery should be charged to a maximum voltage of 14.4 Volts..\nHow long will a 100ah battery run a fridge?\n1000 hoursA very small user of power is a 1.2 watt LED light running on a 12 volt power source will use 1.2W / 12V = 0.1 amps.

Many species are endemic to this region and found nowhere else in the world. The rolling foothills of our Piedmont region were once home to “Piedmont prairies” with a plant palette similar to that of Midwestern prairies.\nHowever, much of this land has been used and abused since the 1700s, the mountains timbered, the rich soil of its gentle foothills eroded and exhausted by cotton, the rivers polluted by the mills and industries which gravitated to their banks.\nThe Swamp Rabbit Trail follows the path of an old shortline railroad that carried freight (often timber) from the mountains above Marietta into Greenville. Some of the Trail also parallels the Reedy River. It’s a delightful glimpse into our communal “backyard” — where the plants have been left to fend for themselves.\nNature is resilient. Over the years, the forests began to grow back. The soil lost downstream can never be recovered, but life stored deep in the seedbank continues to emerge. Our citizenry has worked to clean up the waters.\nWhere the Trail is crisscrossed by utility lines, prairie plants emerge: Indian-hemp, Splitbeard Bluestem, a multitude of Sunflowers, Asters and Goldenrods.
