No difference in the rate of tattoo clearing was seen. All 3 treatment intervals resulted in approximately 50% clearing after 3 treatment sessions; however, as the number of treatments increases, the potential for tissue reaction also increases.\nOccasional rest periods or longer treatment intervals of 2-3 months allow melanin to recover and transient textural changes to normalize, which may help avoid unwanted adverse tissue responses. Higher fluences and shorter pulse widths appear to remove tattoo pigment more rapidly but may induce excessive shock wave tissue reaction; therefore, they must be balanced with the desire to remove pigment without scarring or hypopigmentation. The current recommendation is to treat at 6- to 8-week intervals unless a longer period is needed for tissue recovery. \nRecommended treatment parameters\nThe main parameters include pulse duration, wavelength, fluence, and spot size. All of the Q-switched lasers are in the nanosecond range, and pulse width is predetermined by the laser. Wavelength is chosen based on the best available wavelength for the tattoo ink color. For example, red ink is best treated by a green wavelength (510 or 532 nm), and green ink is best treated by a red wavelength (694 or 755 nm). When melanin is present, the 1064-nm wavelength is the best choice to avoid disruption of the epidermis.\nFluence should be sufficient to produce immediate whitening without immediate bleeding or blistering. Larger spot sizes provide deeper penetration and should be used as long as sufficient fluence can be obtained. This maximizes the distribution of laser light to the dermal pigment and minimizes cutaneous injury. Predicting the number of treatment sessions necessary for tattoo removal is difficult.\nFrequently, the initial treatment session produces a more dramatic response than subsequent sessions. Definite sites of clearing, corresponding to laser impacts, are often seen.

In this article, we will explore the essential aspects of tattoo care during the seasons and provide valuable tips to ensure your tattoo stays in top shape all year round. We will also introduce a reliable tattoo care product called Bitchin Butter that can enhance your tattoo care routine.\nTattoos have become increasingly popular as a way to express one’s personality and commemorate significant life events. However, many people overlook the importance of proper tattoo care, especially during different seasons. In this article, we will delve into the topic of caring for tattoos during summer and winter, focusing on the unique challenges each season presents and offering practical solutions to maintain the beauty and integrity of your ink.\nUnderstanding Tattoo Care\nBefore we dive into the specifics of seasonal tattoo care, it’s essential to have a basic understanding of general tattoo care principles. Proper tattoo care begins immediately after getting inked and continues for the rest of your tattoo’s life. Some crucial aspects of tattoo care include keeping the tattoo clean, moisturized, protected from the sun, and avoiding excessive scratching. By following these basic guidelines, you can minimize the risk of infection, fading, and other complications.\nImportance of Seasonal Tattoo Care\nSeasonal changes, particularly between summer and winter, bring about significant variations in weather conditions, temperature, and humidity. These changes can have a profound impact on your tattoo’s appearance and overall health. Neglecting seasonal tattoo care can lead to issues such as sunburn, dryness, cracking, and premature fading. By adapting your tattoo care routine to the specific requirements of each season, you can preserve the vibrancy and longevity of your ink.\nCaring for Your Tattoo in Summer\nSummer is a time of increased sun exposure, higher temperatures, and more outdoor activities. These factors can pose unique challenges for your tattoo’s well-being. Here are some essential tips to care for your tattoo during the summer months:\nProtecting Your Tattoo from the Sun\nExcessive sun exposure can cause your tattoo to fade and lose its clarity over time. To protect your tattoo, always apply a high SPF sunscreen to the inked area before going outside.", "score": 0.822688758, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:517afc0c-0d0d-4847-97c5-45298b4abb89>", "text": "The resulting gray-black tattoo may prove difficult to remove and is certainly more visible than the flesh tone; therefore, test sites are recommended with patient consent. If darkening occurs, immediately re-treat the area, then wait several weeks to assess the darkened tattoo's response. If it has lightened significantly, treatment can proceed. Q-switched lasers seem ideal for removing large areas of black facial tattoos (tarsal fanning of pigment, eyebrow tattoo). However, the beam size (2-6.5 mm) may make removal of small dots of precisely confined tattoo pigment (eg, eyeliner tattoo) technically difficult without risk of temporary or permanent hair loss from heat damage to the terminal hair.\nUse caution with the high fluences and very short pulses from Q-switched lasers, which may increase the risk of tissue reaction. Potential, irreversible pigment darkening induced by laser interaction with iron oxide or titanium dioxide pigments warrants a test site. Selected patients, especially those with eyeliner tattoos, may be treated with high-powered carbon dioxide and erbium lasers because of the precision available and/or the need to bypass the ink-darkening phenomenon. The picosecond laser may also be an option to treat paradoxical tattoo darkening. \nHigh-energy short pulses cause a pressure shock wave that ruptures blood vessels and aerosolizes tissue (with potentially infectious particles), requiring a barrier or a cone device to protect the operator from tissue and blood contact. Lower fluences largely eliminate this problem but result in more treatment sessions. Scarring or tissue textural changes are also attributable to hot spots within the beam and pulse-to-pulse variability. Maintaining a high-energy output with a larger spot size (which decreases fluency) is equally effective, with less hazard to the operator and fewer adverse effects (less epidermal disruption) for the patient.\nComparative Studies of Q-switched Lasers\nDirect comparison studies of the various available wavelengths are difficult because treatment parameters, including pulse width, spot size, and fluence, are hard to standardize and results are therefore often inconclusive.\nSeveral comparative studies have been performed by using different lasers on the same tattoos. A comparison of the QSRL and Nd:YAG lasers found them equally effective in removing black ink; however, the QSRL was more effective in removing green ink. A second comparison of the QSRL and Nd:YAG lasers was limited to 1 treatment session, and a similar response was noted.", "score": 0.822371662, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:a7ccf863-a64e-4cd6-ba49-997497fb298d>", "text": "Second Skin Tattoo is environmental health registered and maintains the highest standards of hygiene.\nThe studio has a top of the range starclave print autoclave and ultrasonic cleaner in line with current legislation.\nAs would be expected, brand new needles are used for every tattoo.

These devices are what the tattoo artist uses to apply your tattoo.\nWhat Is a Tattoo Gun?\nA tattoo gun is a handheld gun-shaped machine (hence the name) that drives tattoo ink into the skin. It allows the artist to make tiny hand movements and is gentle enough to use even on the face - such as when permanent make-up is applied. The term tattoo gun is still used in Europe; in the United States, tattoo machine is a more popular term.\nInterestingly enough, the tattoo gun was invented by Thomas Edison (yes, the light bulb Edison). The machine was patented in the US in 1876 as an autographic printer. In 1891, Samuel O'Reily tailored the printer into a tattoo gun by adding a tube and needle system. This wasn't the first time society found a use for one of Edison's inventions that he hadn't intended, but it is doubtful he ever envisioned his printer being used to create tattoos or that a variation of his invention would still be in use over a hundred years later.\nHow the Gun Works\nThe tattoo gun uses electromagnetic coils to move the needle up and down to drive the pigment/ink into the skin. The needle moves up and down between 80 and 150 times a second, allowing the tattoo artist to penetrate the skin with ink without moving his hand. Most tattoo machines can control needle depth to almost any degree and different needles are used depending on what kind of work is being done. Most versions of the gun are turned off and on through the use of a foot pedal.\nTattoos go into the lower layer of skin, or the dermis and are not designed to go into the fatty layer of skin. The tattoo machine has to be exact enough to penetrate the scaly layer and epidermis layer to leave the ink in the dermis layer. The needle of the tattoo machine makes little holes in the skin, which the ink is deposited into. The ink does fade out of the dermis layer after a while, so get your tattoos refreshed every couple of years.\nDoes Tattooing Hurt?\nBeing on the receiving end of a tattoo gun can be painful, although reports vary about how much. The level of pain depends on your artist's skill, your own pain threshold, and on what part of your body the tattoo is applied.", "score": 0.05385343232615654, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:820dd0df-7c44-416b-be06-c78c0baa57f3>", "text": "To try salabrasion, you’re going to need water, salt, and a rubbing pad like a sponge. After cleaning the skin around your undesired tattoo, you’ll want to roll the pad in the salty water and then use the pad to scrub the skin. Keep rubbing the area for about 30 minutes, removing the upper layer of skin.\nHow long do poke and stick tattoos last?\nInexperienced artists may go too deep or not deep enough, causing the tattoo to fade prematurely. Deciding whether or not to get a stick and poke tattoo isn’t easy. While not permanent, they can last for many years. You should always be aware of the risks, and take necessary precautions.\nHow do you make a fake tattoo look real?\nAfter you have removed the paper and your tattoo is fully adhered to your skin, dust the area with baby powder or translucent powder (found in most cosmetics stores). Translucent powder will remove the shine providing more of a matte finish to your tattoo. Finally, spray the tattoo with hairspray or finishing spray.\nWhat hurts more stick and poke or gun?\nDoes it generally hurt more or less than the traditional method? “In general it doesn’t hurt as much as a machine tattoo as it’s far less invasive, which means the skin heals much quicker too. However the pain often depends on the particular area being tattooed – some areas will hurt more than others.\nAre stick and pokes illegal?\nA stick and poke tattoo is created by using a needle, or group of needle, to put ink into the skin. There is no electric machine involved, so the tattoo artist does this by hand using only a needle or a tool that holds the needle. … Stick and pokes are not illegal if they are done by a licensed artist.", "score": 0.031882527747337366, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:70ec47a1-ab19-4280-9ec6-a14348d1df5d>", "text": "Men marked their arms and hands with initials of themselves and loved ones, significant dates, symbols of the seafaring life, liberty poles, crucifixes, and other symbols.\"\nWhile people can—and still routinely do—get tattooed using the traditional Polynesian needle-stick method, the tribal arm band that your barrister is rocking was most likely applied with the modern method: a needle gun. Comprising a sterilised needle driven by an electric motor, the gun injects dye about a millimetre under the skin at a rate of 50 to 3,000 pricks per minute and is controlled via a sewing machine-style foot pedal.\nA rotary tattoo machine - image: Access Tattoo\nThe modern tattoo gun traces its roots back to Samuel O'Reilly's 1891 invention of the rotary tattoo machine, the world's first such patented device. Based on an earlier patent by Thomas Edison designed to make copies of office documents by punching through the original and depositing ink in a second leaf of paper underneath. This device employed an electric motor to drive a rotating crankshaft which lifted and lowered the needle.\nA coil tattoo gun - image: dondesigns\nLater improvements on this initial design integrated a fitted ramp that increased the drive's efficiency. Known as coil (or hybrid rotary) tattoo machines, these are the most commonly used type of tattoo gun. Unlike their rotary forerunners, which used a physical mechanism to drive the needle, coil guns use an electromagnetic circuit to do so, generally causing less damage to the skin.\nA pneumatic tattoo machine\nThe latest revolution to tattoo technology came in 2000 when Tattoo Carson Hill debuted the world's first pneumatic tattoo machine. Unlike electrical guns, a pneumatic tattoo machine is gas driven and, more importantly, can be sterilised in an autoclave. This drastically reduces the rate of post-inking infection. Going beyond that, the Neuma company introduced a hybrid pneumatic-electric machine in 2009 that actively released an antimicrobial agent whenever the needle touches liquid. This all but eliminates the chances of the machine picking up a blood-borne pathogen which can be spread to the next customer.\nTattoo artist Ron Ackers at work in Bristol, Great Britain c. 1950's - image: Vintage Gal\nThese days, it's not just sailors and ruffians that get inked.

The ink has to get into the tissue underneath the outer layer of skin. The outer layer is called the epidermis, and the ink must get to the dermis.\nThousands of tiny pricks in the skin are made by the machine used; the machine is held by the tattoo artist and has a needle fixed to it. The needle will be dipped in ink, and the artist will power the motor that powers the machine. The needle then pricks the skin quickly and repeatedly.\nTattoo needles can vary from place to place. They can have 3 to 25 ends, and different needles can achieve different effects. A machine can pierce the skin anywhere from 50-3000 times per minute.\nThe ink must get down into the dermis, as the outer layer of skin is always shedding and repairing itself. This means the tattoo wouldn’t last very long at all in the epidermis. However, if the tattoo is pierced too deeply into the skin, if too much pressure is applied by the artist, it will not only be extremely painful, but look distorted and ugly as it scars your skin.\nThis is why you must have a reputable tattoo artist who knows what they are doing.\nWhat Sort Of Ink Is Used For Tattoos?\nThere are different brands and types of ink, and the type used can depend on which parlour you go to for your tattoo. It could be worth enquiring about the type of ink used, as they all contain different chemicals that go into your body. Many parlours now use vegan inks.\nInks contain different ingredients, such as glycerine, pigment, water, titanium oxide, and more.

We get plenty from just seeing the record itself: the mix of sci-fi and kanji in the typeface, the track titles—\"House Of Horror,\" \"51 Days In Waco,\" \"25 O'Clock Apocalypse\"—that evoke differing forms of terror. Put the record on the turntable and these vibes come alive. This is Mitchell, one of the defining figures in early New York techno, experimenting with intense interpretations of acid, the sound that had emerged in Chicago around five years prior as an offshoot of house music.\nAcid Archives 92-94, which collects 15 tracks, most of which were released between those years, is a sonic dialectic in progress. The original acid sound, popularised by acts like DJ Pierre/Phuture, Ron Hardy, Bam Bam, Sleezy D and others, was itself raw and rough, but for Mitchell it seems, not raw and rough enough. Increasing speed and distortion are a couple ways he got there. There's barely a kick drum here that isn't frazzled, and we're sometimes in the region of 150 BPM. But what stands out more is just how chaotic a headspace his tracks create. Snares and cymbals are used like rhythmic detonations. Voice samples seem tailored to fracture the minds of addled ravers. The acid lines from Mitchell's 303 are bizarre, cunning or, in places, even scary. It's as easy to imagine people in a state of outright darkened euphoria as it is people fleeing, utterly shaken, from a dance floor.\nL.I.E.S. makes the point that, with so many extreme and/or uptempo styles of dance music currently being pushed by a new generation of artists, the time seems right for a compilation such as Acid Archives 92-94. Indeed, there's actually something here that no contemporary producer can offer: the thrill and spirit of an artist exploring an almost totally new sound.

The band gained lots of status as one of the heaviest and most brutal underground Death Metal bands back in the day and they indeed enjoyed a pretty large following through all those years when they existed.\nHowever, Rottrevore neither appealed me that much nor I liked them that much for some strange reason the way like I honored so many other underground Death Metal acts at that time; now I´m referring with this to such bands as Pyrexia, Suffocation, Funebre, Carnage, Nihilist/Entombed, Necrovore, Gorguts, etc. For me Rottrevore was basically a bit too \"noisy Death Metal act (just like a band like Mortician has always been)\" that never caused any THAT big reactions in me after all.

For example songs on “Allenthesis” are more death metal oriented. Material from the “F.R.E.A.K.” is more amateurish and has more noisecore elements.\nI think this CD will be interesting for these who love to discover old and not famous bands, for these who lost their old Orchestral Pit’s Cannibals tapes during the decades, and who want to refresh their memories about this nasty band.\nRemember guys, keep the underground music scene strong by supporting the artist/band/labels.

In particular, I was influenced by commercial drum ‘n’ bass, tropical house and electronic artists like Chainsmokers and Cheat Codes.\nHow easy was it to select the final tracks for your EP, and were there any tracks that didn’t make the cut?\nIt was actually pretty easy to select the tracks as I knew how I wanted to tell a story. I wrote Take It All and You Are My Weakness first and then worked backwards through the narrative. There was only a couple of songs I wrote in that period that I decided wouldn’t fit on the EP, just as they didn’t have the right lyrical content.\nCould you tell me about your writing process? Being a solo artist do you have anyone to bounce ideas from, or do you just know when a song is ready?\nI tend to come up with song ideas at really random times, so I record a quick idea on my phone and then work it out fully at the piano later.

Tracks were mostly centered around the TR-808 drum machine.\nDrexciya, which eschewed media attention and its attendant focus on personality, developed an afrofuturist myth. The group revealed in the sleeve notes to their 1997 album The Quest that \"Drexciya\" was an underwater country populated by the unborn children of pregnant African women who were thrown off of slave ships; the babies had adapted to breathe underwater in their mother's wombs. The myth was built partly on Paul Gilroy's The Black Atlantic: Modernity and Double Consciousness (1993), according to Kodwo Eshun.\nReports of Drexciya's disbanding in 1997 were contradicted two years later when a new Drexciya track appeared on the Underground Resistance compilation Interstellar Fugitives, followed by three more Drexciya albums.\n- The Quest (1997), Submerge\n- Neptune's Lair (1999), Tresor\n- Harnessed the Storm (2002), Tresor\n- Grava 4 (2002), Clone\nEPs and singles\n- \"Deep Sea Dweller\" (1992), Shockwave Records\n- \"Drexciya 2: Bubble Metropolis\" (1993), Underground Resistance\n- \"Aquatic Invasion\" (1994), Underground Resistance\n- \"Drexciya 3: Molecular Enhancement\" (1994), Rephlex, Submerge\n- \"Drexciya 4: The Unknown Aquazone\" (1994), Submerge\n- The Journey Home (1995), Warp Records\n- \"The Return Of Drexciya\" (1996), Underground Resistance\n- \"Uncharted\" (1998), Somewhere In Detroit\n- \"Fusion Flats\" (1999), Tresor\n- \"Hydro Doorways\" (2000), Tresor\n- \"Digital Tsunami\" (2001), Tresor\n- \"Drexciyan R.E.S.T.", "score": 5.2058836088786686e-08, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:b009278b-3a2f-4ffb-b8d0-7e57e361d2cb>", "text": "Each story is unique, and in each film I had creative input. I can’t just push the button on the camera. For me it is all about \"directing\" the cameras, that's why a cinematographer is also known as the Director of Photography, or DP.\nPLM: What makes you pick one project over another?\nEP: Story again; but it also depends on the director. If I feel that the director can let me in and trust me, then I know we are going to have a lot of fun and create something great.\nPLM: What has been your favorite project or projects so far and why?\nEP: It is very hard to say. Each of them is different. A cinematographer has a lot of instruments in order to tell the story and every film can be shot in a ton of ways. So far, there hasn't been one project that I shot like any of the others, so they are all uniquely different and impossible to choose.\nPLM: What has been your most challenging project and why?\nEP: Every project is challenging. Most of the time it is in terms of limitations in the budget so you can’t get necessary equipment, or bring more people on board. It’s always challenging, but interesting at the same time. You will be wondering how much can be accomplished with only one 650W lighting kit and a limited grip stuff, but that's why it is a challenge and the reason it feels so great when you've accomplished your goal.\nPLM: What separates your overall visual style from other cinematographers?\nEP: I can’t compare my style to others because there are tons of cinematographers who might shoot the same way as I do. I can tell you that I like wide lenses, even on close-ups. It's gorgeous how a 25mm lens wraps the face (with no distortion), adding life to a character and making the shot more dynamic; but again, that depends of what kind of feel needs to be represented in the scene. My work mixes a European and Hollywood style of cinematography.\nI like to light the set first, not the actor. In this way the actor gets the space to LIVE in it, not just act, that ay he or she can have absolute freedom in their movements.

I mean, there was a keyboard player, but he was kept very much in the background. In a three-piece band, obviously the guitar player’s got to work real hard on the rhythm. So the guy’s gotta work hard. He was very good at that, and that’s the thing that wouldn’t be obvious in the studio particularly. Onstage he would be playing both – he’d be hitting the leads, and he’d pull the lead one note short to be able to get into the next section for the rhythm. When I saw him live, the difference was he’d be more dynamic insofar as he’d be leaping between two or three different parts to try and cover them all, which he seemed to do pretty good.

Then I came up with the final structure of my piece and wrote the score for the flute and soprano.\nHow has the technology that you have used enhanced or hindered the musical possibilities of your piece?\nFiona: Using MaxMSP has really enhanced my ability to blend the acoustic and electronic soundworlds through the processing of the live instruments. I used ProTools to record the instruments and create the backing track. This has allowed me to transform the flute and voice recordings in ways which wouldn’t be possible in a live setting. It has also allowed me to layer many more sounds than I would be able to with the two instruments alone.\nHow did you develop your musical material throughout the piece?\nFiona: The musical material was initially developed through the processing of recorded sound, largely using the GRM freeze and evolution plugins. These plugins allowed me to create beds and loops of sound which formed the starting point and underlying driver of the musical material. Once these sounds were in place I was then able to layer and develop a structure to the piece. The musical ideas for the live sounds were developed through improvising over the electronic bed I created and then making selections from there of what worked well and what I wanted to use.\nHow would you describe the process of collaboration?\nFiona: Collaboration is an invaluable tool for a composer or any creative. Through sharing ideas and working together it’s possible to draw on each other’s expertise and push oneself in new directions. In this project I worked closely with Lamorna and Jane on developing sounds that would work well with the effects processing used in the work. In particular with the flute we had a number of workshops to find the best sounds for this piece.\nLamorna, could you tell a bit about performing the piece?\nLamorna: One of the biggest challenges of performing a piece like Imago is staying together with the backing track which is fixed. This means that you need to play with a stopwatch – keeping an eye on the clock to make sure that you move from one section to the next at the correct moment as well as listening out for aural cues. Some gestures need to be synchronised like regular chamber music so following the score and having a close visual connection between the musicians is also vital.", "score": 0.47463454332305, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:3096d3ad-8696-4441-a4a9-c500206131a2>", "text": "DELIVER US FROM EVIL\nSo shall we include this one on the album - another 1980's HELL live favourite - or not?

As you descend, consider the countless numbers of marine organisms that make up the more 450-foot thick cliff you are passing through.

The top of the Redwall is also pock-marked with semicircular depressions representing ancient sinkholes, some may be related to the caves formed within the limestone unit.

The sand and silt was deposited with iron and trace minerals that provided it with the key ingredient to form the colors we see today.\nWhat was once a layered horizontal and flat stratigraphy was disrupted by the Indian Plate colliding into the Eurasian Plate approximately 55 million years ago. Much like when two cars get in a wreck and the bumpers fold and break, a similar process folded what was once flat sandstones into the Rainbow Mountains we see today. This process uplifted mountains and exposed sedimentary rocks that were otherwise hidden well below the surface of the earth. Weathering and erosion removed the overlying layers of continental siliciclastic rocks and exposed underlying formations with different mineralogy and chemistry. This causes the striking variation in colors seen across the Rainbow Mountains.\nhow they got the color we see today.\nPrecipitated groundwater moves through the sandstone grains and deposits trace minerals in between the grains. This precipitate can build up to a point where there is no longer an pore space between the individual grains, cementing them in place. This process is what imparts the trace minerals mentioned below and allows for the otherworldly coloring of sandstones around the world.\nThe primary color is a deep red sandstone, not unlike the Fountain Formation that outcrops in the Flatirons, Red Rocks Park, and the Garden of the Gods all in Colorado. The red coloring is due to an iron oxide coating and cementation, also known as hematite (Fe2O3), between the sandstone grains. This is the exact same process that takes place when a piece of metal is left out in the rain and forms a red layer of rust around the outside.\nWeathering, mixed with water and oxygen oxidizes elemental iron into iron oxide, which is notable for its dark red coloring. The Rainbow Mountains are largely characterized by this iron oxide staining of its sandstone Danxia formation.\nMost of the time iron oxides impart a dark red pigment, however, there are instances where oxides form different colors. For example oxidized limonite or goethite will produce brown or yellow staining of sandstones, magnetite can form black staining of sandstones.

It’s a perfect place for hiking, camping or just a day tour from Las Vegas, located only 88 km (55 miles) northeast of Las Vegas.\nGeology: The Formation of the Amazing Landscape\nThe park got its name from the red sandstone that dominates throughout the area that were formed from shifting sand dunes. The rock formations were created from complex uplifting and faulting followed by extensive erosion. Other rocks include limestones, shales and conglomerate.\nThe ridge of grey rocks are the oldest in the park, dating back to the Paleozic Era and are between 250 and 550 million year old. The red rocks are younger and were formed between 66 and 250 million years ago during the Mesozoic Era. The grey rocks are Paleozic limestone made up of the remains of plants and animals of the sea that invaded the area 600 million years ago. The sea advanced and retreated for 400 million years. Today you will be able to find evidence of fossils deposited in these rocks during that era.\nThe red rocks of the Mesozoic area were formed when the sea retreated for the last time and the area became a massive plain of sand, silt, clay and gravel.

I felt that the shoe really gripped the rock. I do not believe that they performed any better, per se, than the Volley. In contact with slimy rock they slipped just as any other shoe I think would.\n3) Water drainage:\nI wondered from the off-set how the SARs little drainage hole would act.

This rock contains numerous ammonites fossils from which it takes its name; it can only be observed in a cleft of Mount Resino, in the area of Fontanafredda. As per the genesis of the next rock, it originated between 135 and 90 million years ago in the late Cretaceous, and is called Biancone (White Giant).

Although there are differences between these groups, we are all united in the purpose of putting the teachings of the Buddha into practice.\nWe are all primarily concerned with the more inward aspects of practice: How to put the mind of meditation into practice in the many varied facets of day to day life; how to make the mind of preceptual practice into a refuge in the many complexities of our modern world.\nOutwardly, the practice of the monastic members of the community is more formal than that of the laity. We wear robes and shave our heads, giving ourselves a uniform appearance; we regulate our day to day lives with schedules and detailed rules – including the practice of celibacy – giving ourselves a formal framework in which to practice the “letting go” aspect of meditation. After a specified period of training within the monastic setting, monks may be licensed to teach, run temples, offer spiritual guidance and perform other priestly duties, such as weddings and funerals. Many live in our monasteries, others live singly or together in smaller temples.\nBecause they are not constrained by the outward formal aspects of monastic practice, lay practitioners often have a greater latitude in the actions they can take in responding to the needs that arise in the context of their lives and in being of benefit to the world. Within the context of preceptual practice, they can pursue a variety of relationships – including active family life – and pursue career and occupational choices as well as other lifestyle choices not available to those who choose the monastic path.\nIn the Serene Reflection Meditation Tradition, a person can follow the Way as a lay person or as a monk.

Opportunities for ordination are widely available to men, but it is a rare monk who finds himself encouraged to devote himself entirely to the practice. In village monasteries, monks have long been pressured to study medicine so that they can act as the village doctors or to study astrology to become personal counselors. Both of these activities are forbidden by the disciplinary rules, but are very popular with the laity -- so popular that until recent times a village monk who did not take up either of these vocations was regarded as shirking his duties. Scholarly monks in the cities have long been told that the path to nibbana is no longer open, that full-time practice would be futile, and that a life devoted to administrative duties, with perhaps a little meditation on the side, is the most profitable use of one's monastic career.\nOn top of this, parents who encourage their sons from early childhood to take temporary ordination often pressure them to disrobe soon after ordination if they show any inclination to stay in the monkhood permanently and abandon the family business. Even families who are happy to have their sons stay in the monkhood often discourage them from enduring the hardships of a meditator's life in the forest.\nIn some cases the state of mainstream Buddhism has become so detrimental to the practice that institutional reforms have been attempted. In the Theravada tradition, such reforms have succeeded only if introduced from the top down, when senior monks have received the support of the political powers that be.

Mahanama) more than 1000 years after the passing away of Lord Buddha is also considered as a part of the Buddhist scriptures.\nDue to ignorance, even the present day Sinhala-Buddhists still believe that they are blood relatives of Buddha because, according to the Mahavamsa, their forefather Pandu-Vasudeva belongs to the Sakya clan, and is a relative of the Buddha where as the historians believe that the term ‘Pandu' in Pali means Pandyans.\nAccording to Buddhism, a person ordained as a Bikkhu should practice Ahimsa (non-violence), Karuna (compassion), Metta (affection), and Maithriya (loving-kindness) towards fellow humans, (irrespective of race or religion), not only by words but also in his thoughts and action. Unfortunately in Sri Lanka, due to the influence of the Mahavamsa, a Buddhist Bikkhu is at liberty to engage in racist politics and promote Sinhala-Buddhist chauvinism and hatred, as we see today.\nThere was NO Buddhism in Sri Lanka until Emperor Asoka's missionary monks led by Mahinda converted the Hindu (Siva worshipping) Naga King Tissa into a Buddhist in the 2nd century BC.

This is broadly known as Newar/Newarese Buddhism, also named as the Buddhism of Nepalmandal. It is, broadly, Vajrayana with Hindu influence and is dominated by tantraism. So, shortly, it is an intricate pluralistic religious system, as it is often referred to.\nBuddhism is same everywhere in the world. Despite of existence of different sects and disciplines, they all agree that the teaching of the Buddha is their principle guideline. And their major objective, of following the Buddhism, is the same. Still, the Buddhism, followed by the Newars in the Katmandu Valley and the surrounding settlements of the Newars is unique. So, it needs special attention to understand this.\na. Monasteries: This is one of the major elements of this branch of Buddhism. These monasteries are built as a courtyard surrounded by two-storied buildings consisting of halls. A major deity, mostly Shakyamuni Buddha, is installed there. They are categorized as “Bahals” and “Bahils”. There are over 400 historic monasteries of Newars in the valley. The household monks serve there and conduct rituals everyday in most of them, while, some of them are in dilapidated condition and some have even disappeared.\nb. Household Monasticism: The monasteries, however, do not have any celibate monks these days. It is said that King Jayasthiti Malla (1374–1395 AD) introduced the caste system among Newars and forcefully disrobed the celibate monks.

Finally, Tongal begins after reciting various Buddhist hymns such as “Saphyangge,” “Galhyangge,” and “Yeonhyangge.” However, in recent years, the Tongal ceremony has generally been performed without Chuksangjakbeop.\nAfter the Tongal ceremony, monks have rice cake soup, the traditional New Year’s dish in Korea, and visit elder monks who reside farther away, to offer three bows as New Year’s greetings. For a few days afterward, the laity continues to visit monks to offer their greetings. In return, they receive some money in an envelope, which the monks call an amulet. Sometimes, monks give the money along with a Dharni, or mantra, written with a pigment made from Gyeolmyeongjusa, a bright silvery-red mineral, which can be used to see one’s face, like a mirror. The laypeople take the money and mantras as their amulets, and treasure these throughout the year.\nTongal in Buddhism can be regarded as a new year’s bow, offered to the elders among common people, which is a type of offering to the three jewels in Buddhism. It became popular during the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910) and has been continuously practiced in temples up until now. If the bowed greetings among family members and relatives signify the wish for wellness in a new year in the mundane world, Tongal in Buddhism signifies paying homage to the three jewels. This tradition contains the wishes for compassion and the awakening of all the sentient beings, in a broader sense.\nSometimes, people argue about the order of the procedure, whether the bowing or the ancestral ceremony should come first on the morning of a new year’s day. Like the hierarchical Tongal in Buddhism, it is appropriate to pay respect to the beings in the transcendental world, and then to beings in the present world. Though it may seem proper to offer New Year’s greetings to the elders of the current world first, the ancestral ceremony and the bowing should be considered equivalent. If the New Year’s bowing begins with the offering to the elders, it is only appropriate that a ceremony to the ancestors, the eldest of all, should be offered first of all.", "score": 0.011253998758390761, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:da88360a-878a-480c-8da5-0230a85c6e0a>", "text": "Mahayana Buddhism. . .\nToday we look into the most accepted and practiced form of Buddhism – Mahayana Buddhism.\nIn contrast to Theravada Buddhism, Mahayana Buddhism is the more liberal and the largest branch of Buddhism practiced around the world. Mahayanists use the Sanskrit version of the Buddha’s teachings. These teachings emerged much later than the Pali Canon and are known as Sutras. They incorporate Pali texts as well as thousands of other volumes that contain extensions of the Buddha’s message. Taken as a whole, the texts often present complex and at times contradictory teachings. Therefore, there are more varied beliefs and practices among Mahayanist practitioners.\nBasically the teachings through the Sutras maintain there are multiple universes and multiple Buddhas. They view the Buddha (Siddhartha Gautama) as a transcendent being, that spans time and concepts. The teachings focus more on transcending life through practice and The Sutras teach that the path to enlightenment is open to everyone. All people, not just monks, can attain nirvana. This is a fundamental concept and one The Buddha himself taught.\nMahāyāna Buddhism takes the basic teachings of The Buddha as recorded in early scriptures as the starting point of its teachings, such as those concerning karma and rebirth, anātman, emptiness, dependent origination, and the Four Noble Truths. It teaches that we can should utilize these concepts through our own actions and mindsets not just for the improvement of ourselves but the betterment of all and the moments we inhabit and share together.\nAnother significant element of Mahayana Buddhism is the introduction of bodhisattvas. Bodhisattvasare figures that have already attained nirvana, but instead of going there immediately, they have compassionately chosen to wait and assist individuals who cannot get there on their own for various reasons, such as lack of discipline or insufficient merit making. Compassion is one of the highest ideals within this branch. Mahayana Buddhism holds mass appeal and is practiced in many countries including China, Korea, Japan, and Vietnam.\nPeace and Love, Jim", "score": 0.006394392987619452, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:143d8ecf-9bff-4206-a34d-175413137b3a>", "text": "If I stop, they’ll just hit my bald head a million times with that broom thing saying Money, Money, Money with identical gusto… I’ll look even more ridiculous.

Here are ways to go deeper into this philosophy and start to practice and understand some Buddhist concepts.\n1. Give alms\nEach morning, all Buddhist monks get up before dawn and set to walk in and around their respective temples. The goal is to collect offerings in the form or food or even money. In exchange, the giver receives blessings in the form of a chant.\nWhat to do: Put your offering in the monk’s alms bowl and kneel while bringing your hands in a praying position while lowering your head. The monk will chant for about 1 minute.\nWhere to do it: At any moment when you see a monk walk around between 4:30 and 7AM. The most popular place to do this in Chiang Mai is the at the Chiang Mai Gate Market near the South-East corner of the old city where dozens of monks gather every morning.\n2. Attend a Dharma talk\nA Dharma talk will give you the opportunity to directly discuss Buddhism with monks. You will be introduced to the basic principals of Buddhism such as karma and precepts, learn about daily life for a monk and even be allowed to ask questions.\nWhere to do this: Wat Suandok offers a 2 hour talk beginning at 17:00 Monday to Friday.\n3. Learn to meditate\nMeditation is at the center of Buddhism; this is the way the Buddha attained enlightenment. Contrary to popular beliefs, meditation is not practiced while listening to relaxing music. It’s a practice which takes time, regularity and discipline. There are several methods but the ones taught and practiced in Thailand are mostly Vipassana and walking meditation.\nWhere to do it: Wat Rampoeng (temple) offers a mini 10 meditation retreat.

This is a best practice, and unless your business simply doesn’t have enough history for 3 years of data, your model should always account for as much relevant historical data as possible in order to provide the most accurate forecast.\nIdentify your questions and assumptions: This is one of the trickiest parts of financial modeling. Are you asking the right questions and making the right assumptions? Have you considered every possible outcome of every possible choice? What about the probabilities of each outcome? The accuracy of your historical data and your assumptions will greatly impact how accurate the results of your model may be.\nBuild your financial model (usually in Excel): Assuming you’ve completed Step 2 to the best of your ability, building the actual model is usually much more straightforward. But if you’re building your models in Excel (like most analysts do), you have to be very careful when it comes to inputting algorithms and sharing different spreadsheet versions with collaborators.

But data visualization is as much an art as it is a science, and Excel certainly doesn’t make it easy for analysts to present their results in an approachable format for stakeholders.

We started our house example by using a very high-level picture to describe the scope and basic requirements.

In a data model, we may use a picture containing a simple set of boxes that clarify the differences between, for example, a primary home and a vacation home. The house diagrams were created by the architect and me, a layperson. Similarly, in the data world, both a business person and a data architect would work together on the data model diagrams, with business people able to do much of the work themselves.

For my house example, the architect drew a high-level picture to show what he had in mind for the house — that it would have a front porch, be big enough to sleep a large number of people, etc. For data, we use a high-level data model to clarify what information is important, how basic concepts are defined and how these concepts relate to each other.\nIn Figure 1.7, a set of boxes and lines clarifies what I mean by a 'house'. There is a textual description of a house and we also show how the concept of house relates to other concepts I had in mind. For example, a house isn't a 'house' to me unless it has a front porch; and it must have multiple bedrooms. We'll go into more detail regarding the exact notation for these models in Chapter 3, but for now, you should be able to understand what this model is trying to express.\nNote again the roles involved in creating this level of diagram.

Zoning dictates the place varied land use actions, comparable to residential, industrial or industrial might be situated. Zoning can regulate many different issues as properly, such a density, peak, yard setbacks, and many others. Nevertheless, the usage of the land is the first concern.\nWhy Change The Zoning?\nThe principle cause to vary zoning is since you see a chance. What alternatives are there? It may very well be to develop a residential subdivision. It may very well be to construct an condominium constructing. It may very well be to transform a home into an workplace. It may very well be a myriad of different issues. The chance you see, nonetheless, is probably not permitted below the present zoning legislation. Thus, you’ll must petition to have that legislation modified.\nHow Do You Change Zoning?\nAltering zoning might be troublesome and expensive. You may assume that altering zoning is so simple as 1, 2, three. It’s not. Truly, it may be a extremely sophisticated course of relying on the place your property is situated. It can be fairly pricey, and there are no ensures that you’re going to get what you ask for. Pay attention to these details stepping into.\nThe issue and costliness come up, partially, as a result of there aren’t any normal zoning legal guidelines. Each metropolis, each city, and each county that has zoning could make up their very own distinctive guidelines and processes. Even cities proper subsequent door to one another can have broadly various zoning legal guidelines. Altering zoning can also be a political course of.

Everything we do in our lives involves processes and lots of them. Here are some examples:\n. . . and the list goes on.\nAs you can see, the level of importance of processes varies.\n- Some processes, such as conducting an UNREP or mooring a ship, are very important.

Some processes may be comparatively simple. Repairing a valve, for example, may be a relatively simple task involving only a few people and straightforward procedures. On the other hand, some processes, such as conducting a main space fire drill, are very complicated. Many people are involved and numerous process steps and contributing processes are required.Who owns processes?\nEveryone has a stake in one or more processes. Groups of individuals usually share inand \"own\"the activities which make up a process. The one individual who is ultimately responsible and accountable for the proper working of the process is known as the \"process owner.\" The process owner is the immediate supervisor or leader who has control over the entire process from beginning to end.\nA process owner may choose to be a team leader and participate directly in the actions of a process improvement team. Or, the process owner may decide to delegate the team leadership role to another person who is knowledgeable about the process.

Download the iPING putter app. It’s Free!!\nI went from a 15 to a 10 handicap in a little over a year since working with you guys to get all of my clubs matched. The irons especially are really dialed in. -Jay R., Lakewood, CO (January, 2010).\nThe following factors should be considered when choosing a putter. Some are more important than others and for some golfers, just the appearance of the putter can create more confidence.\nPutter Fitting Factors:\n- Lie Angle\n- Grip Size\n- Overall Weight\n- Balance (Swing Weight)\n- Toe Hang\n- Style (Blade, mallet)\nYour putter length, even for a belly putter, should put your eyes over the ball or just slightly inside the ball. If you are too far inside or on top of the ball, your ability to see the putting line will be impaired and you could push or pull your putts. Standard length putters are anywhere from 30″ to 36″ while belly putters are in the range of 38″ to 44″.\nPutter lofts are usually 3 or 4 degrees. This loft allows the ball to get rolling quickly on the green in order to track the putting line more accurately. Too low of loft and the ball will bounce off the putter face. Too high of loft and the ball will skid and not roll accurately towards the target. Your hand position at impact can be a large factor in what loft you should have on your putter. Speed of the greens also is a factor. Faster greens require lower loft while slower greens dictate higher loft.\nIf the lie angle of your putter is too upright or too flat, the putter will not contact the ball squarely and cause you to either pull or push your putts. This is best observed by a fitter or a fitting system as it is difficult to determine when you are in your putting posture.\nIf you have a little too much wrist or hand movement in your putting stroke you will be inconsistent in your putting arc and face angle at impact.", "score": 0.865974128, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:ee37e0f9-544e-4d0b-97f0-b2e6ff20c168>", "text": "For the long irons, loft angle 30 varies linearly: approximately a three-degree increase. Similarly, for the short irons, loft angle 30 varies linearly: approximately a four-degree increase. Other variations of loft angle 30 are within the scope of the present invention, and the choice of loft angle 30 may depend upon various other design considerations, such as the choice of material and aesthetics.\nAnother such parameter in club design is the configuration of rear face 20. In a typical set of golf clubs, rear face 20 has either a “cavity back” configuration, i.e., a substantial portion of the mass of the club head is positioned on the back side around the perimeter 32 of the club head, or a “muscle back” configuration, where the mass of the club is relatively evenly distributed along the heel-to-toe length of body 12. Cavity back clubs tend to have larger sweet spots, lower centers of gravity, and higher inertia. In other words, cavity back clubs are easier to produce true hits. In long irons, the sweet spot can be difficult to hit accurately. Therefore, it is desirable for the long irons to have cavity back configurations. Another design for rear face 20 is a “channel back” which is similar to a cavity back with an undercut flange positioned near the sole to move the center of gravity rearward. Muscle back clubs tend to have relatively small sweet spots, higher centers of gravity, and lower inertia about shaft axis 18. If struck correctly, muscle back clubs often yield greater overall performance or workability due to the mass (or muscle) behind the sweet spot, but are more difficult to hit accurately by the average golfer due to the smaller sweet spot. As short irons tend to be easier to hit true for the average golfer, but workability can be lacking, it is desirable for the short irons to have muscle back characteristics.\nAccording to one aspect of the present invention, as discussed in the parent '631 case, the performance continuum of the set is maximized by gradually transforming the configuration of rear face 20 from a predominantly channel back in the long irons to a muscle back in the short irons. According to another aspect of the present invention, as discussed in the parent '745 application and shown in\nAdditionally, a vibration dampening insert is incorporated into the channel back clubs.", "score": 0.863279283, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:ffbdb6a1-bd5f-4938-b196-3e499460be70>", "text": "Who it’s For:\nS NECK PUTTERS\nO-WORKS RED MARXMAN S PUTTER\nO-WORKS BLACK 2-BALL FANG S PUTTER\nToe Hang VS Face Balance\nI’ve got a toe hang putter.

This allows you to launch the ball out of the depression it will inevitably find on the green – never mind making its own very slight depression — and prevents it from bouncing off the side of that depression\n(Fun Fact: Did you know that after every putt is struck, the ball skids and slides for about 15% of the putt distance before it acquires pure rolling spin.) There is no way that a putt can leave the putter face with pure rolling spin, no matter what some manufacturers imply in their marketing)\nRule #5 Select the Right Lie Angle\nDon’t rush into altering the putter’s lie angle to accommodate your putting style or posture. This will prevent you from ever getting into the correct posture and making a good putting stroke.\nTo fix your stroke, a well-fitted putter with a consistent lie angle of about 72 degrees is crucial, regardless of your height.\nThe lie angle will be different for a long putter (about 79-degrees) or in some cases a side saddle putter depending on the side saddle style.\nRule #6 Pay Attention to the Sole\nMost well designed putters will have a slight radius on the sole from toe to heel. This has proven to be most effective because it prevents the toe or heel of the putter from snagging on an undulating green when the ball is higher or lower than your feet. The radius will also allow the putter to sit at slightly different angles +/- a degree or two, to adapt to slight variations in lie angle due to unusual hand position.\nIf the putter’s sole lacks a radius or has very little radius, you may tend to place the putter flat on the green, leaving no margin for variations in green contours. This can lead to toe or heel contact with the green surface during the stroke or prevent slight adjustments to maintain a comfortable posture and hand position.\nRule #7 Consider Alignment Lines on Your Putter\nAlignment lines are a very good feature to look for when selecting your putter. Most putters have some sort of line or dot on the top-line of the putter to indicate the preferred point — i.e. the sweet spot — opposite which to position the ball at address and hopefully return the head to this position at impact.", "score": 0.863029122, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:1c0e1701-8d7f-4af6-bc3d-377c811ba23e>", "text": "Loft Lie Length Swingweight Offset ---- --- ------ ------------ ------ 3-iron 21° 60° 39\" D2 0.160\" 6-iron 31° 62.5° 37.5\" D2 0.120\" 9-iron 43° 64° 36\" D2 0.090\"\nLofts of the clubs are fairly traditional. you may balk at what appears to be one degree less loft than normal on some irons, but I can assure you the tungsten nickel box lowers the CG and raises the ball flight to make up for the slightly stronger loft.

The standard silky silver finish looks great, but we favour the new matte black PVD finish for 2022 as it frames the ball so beautifully and makes the sightline really stand out.\nDW stands for ‘double wide’, as this is essentially the width of two Anser-style blade heads. The beauty of this design is that it’s a halfway house between blade and mallet, so could appeal equally to devotees of either style. It’s easy to align and delivers excellent distance control as a result of its Descending Loft Technology (DLT) face design.\nSIK’s patented face technology is very clever, comprising four planar surfaces that descend in loft from 4 ̊ at the top of the face down to 3 ̊, 2 ̊ and 1 ̊. Even good golfers don’t always deliver the putter blade to the ball in the same way – leaning the shaft a little forward or back during the stroke and varying where and how they strike it on the blade dictate how well putts launch and roll. The DLT face is designed to moderate such inconsistencies, making it stand out from the best putters on the market.\nIf you make contact with the ball higher on the face, you’ve delofted your putter, so DLT adds the loft back higher on the face to get the ball rolling quicker. If you hit it lower on the face, you naturally add loft to the putter, so DLT corrects the launch the other way. The idea is that wherever you make contact, you always end up with an ideal launch angle of 1.5 ̊ to 2 ̊ and therefore better distance control and accuracy on the greens.", "score": 0.862682223, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:4558faea-aa6b-4d3d-b169-04725316858f>", "text": "The loft is the angle of the head face, and it determines the distance of the drive. Also, the trajectory and backspin of the golf all depend on the loft of the driver. The most common driver angles that you are going to find are between 4 and 20 degrees.\nBut how do you choose the best loft for you, as a beginner? Do you make a wild guess?\nOf course not!\nThe best driver loft depends on the swing speed that you have. A high loft is for those with low swing speed, and the reverse is true.\nThe average swing speed of men is around 90 miles per hour. Therefore, the best loft for them is between 10 and 12 degrees.\nDetermine your swinging tempo, athletic abilities, and preference when choosing the ideal weight of the golf driver for you.

It is a case of try and error, but don’t purchase different drivers in a bid to find the right one. You can rent or use those of your friends to determine which weight is the best for you.\nAdjustable drivers make a better choice, especially for beginners because you can adjust the loft and others according to your skills and preferences.\nHowever, you should know that the adjustability of the clubs is not that significant. In that regard, choose the driver that has all the characteristics to make it ideal for you.\nThe adjustability of a particular driver may not cover your preferences and abilities.

It is important to understand that your swing path will almost always mirror your shoulder line. If your shoulders are pointing left of your target line, it is likely that your swing path will also go to the left (out-to-in). You should exercise care in making sure that your shoulders are properly aligned down the target line, or even slightly right of the target line, to encourage an in-to-out swing path.\n- Evaluate your equipment\nModern driver technology has provided an easy fix for golfers looking to minimize or eliminate their slice. Almost all drivers nowadays have adjustable features that allow you to minimize your swing flaws. Loft angles can be changed, along with face angles and swing weight. However, surveys have revealed that 66% of the golfers who already own an adjustable driver don’t take advantage of the adjustability features.\nThis means golfers are missing out on consequential improvements that can make the game easier and much more fun for them. Slicers can alter the face angle on their adjustable driver so that it is more “closed,” offsetting the negative effect of the open club face that they now struggle with. Loft can also be modified. Insufficient loft has a tendency to impart a greater amount of sidespin, which can exaggerate your left-to-right ball flight. Greater loft on a driver will generate backspin and lessen the slice-inducing sidespin. A little time spent on the range tinkering with these adjustments, can turn that unwelcome slice into a manageable fade, or in the best-case scenario, can eliminate it altogether.\nThe reason we all play golf is to have fun and let’s face it, lowering your score is a guaranteed way to make the game far more enjoyable.

Thus, the regional impacts of future climate changes can be largely driven by hydrological changes, not only in the monsoonal areas of the world, but also in temperate areas.\nThe role of the hydrological cycle during abrupt temperature changes is of prime importance for the actual impact of climate change on the continents. In a new study published in Nature Geoscience online (January 19, 2014) scientists from the University of Potsdam, Germany and the GFZ German Research Centre for Geosciences show that during the abrupt cooling at the onset of the so-called Younger Dryas period 12680 years ago changes in the water cycle were the main drivers of widespread environmental change in western Europe. The team of scientists analyzed organic remains extracted from Meerfelder maar lake sediments from the Eifel region, western Germany, to reconstruct changes in precipitation patterns in unprecedented detail. They were able to show that the intrusion of dry polar air into western Europe lead to the collapse of local ecosystems and resulted in the observed widespread environmental changes at that time.\nOrganic remains of plants from lake sediments as molecular rain gauges\nThe exact sequence of events during abrupt climate changes occurring over only a few years is one of the great unknowns in paleoclimate research. The new results presented here were obtained by using a novel method, where molecular organic remains derived from plant fossils were extracted from precisely dated annually laminated lake sediments. The ratio of the heavy Deuterium to the light Hydrogen isotopes in these biomarkers can be used to reconstruct changes in precipitation regime and moisture sources with unprecedented detail.\nThe Younger Dryas period was the last major cold period at the end of the last glaciation with a duration of about 1100 years, when an abrupt change in the pathway of westerly wind systems over Europe lead to massive environmental change within a few years, as GFZ scientists showed in an earlier study. Dirk Sachse, the head of the workgroup at the Institute of Earth and Environmental Sciences of the Potsdam University explains: \"In our new study we can show for the first time that this change in the pathway of westerly wind systems brought dry polar air into western Europe and this was the ultimate cause for the widespread disappearance of forests in the area.\"", "score": 0.827850223, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:1e557afb-157f-4924-b236-f6c374b6facd>", "text": "(2003) shows the back trajectories (type Vb) that fed torrential rains in Germany and the Czech Republic on 11-13 August, 2002. Looking at Figures 2 and 3, it can be seen that this intense precipitation event took place over a section of the European Continental Divide located between Germany and the Czech Republic. These figures illustrate the evident interconnection between hydrological processes from the local to the regional scale in Europe. That is, a local loss of summer storms around the Western Mediterranean, caused by land use changes, leads to a local-to-regional vertical recirculation mode over the Western Mediterranean, and this accumulates water vapour that can participate in major precipitation events, and floods, in other parts of Europe.\nFigure 4. Feedback loops between land-use perturbations in the Western Mediterranean basin and the climatic-hydrological system from the local through the regional to the global scales (EC 2007). The first-local-loop involves the combined seabreezes and upslope winds that end with storms developing in the afternoon over the mountain ranges surrounding the basin. A first critical threshold occurs when the Cloud Condensation Level exceeds the height of the mountains and the loop closes. The closed wind system has a diurnal cycle, a scale of the order of 100 km to 300 km for the surface inflow and return flows aloft, and it can be repeated for periods of 3 to 7+ consecutive days in summer. The second-regional-loop results from the radiative (greenhouse) effect of the water vapour and pollutants accumulated over the sea during these periods, which affects the evolution of the Sea Surface Temperature in the Western Basin during summer. This warm(er) water then feeds torrential rains in autumn and, more recently, also in winter and spring. Another critical threshold is associated with the triggering of mud flows, and massive soil losses, over the vegetation-deprived mountain slopes. Finally, the Atlantic-global loop has two components that can affect the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). The oceanic component derives from losing the moisture accumulated over the Western Mediterranean to feed summer floods in Central-Eastern Europe; it favours the output of saltier water to the Atlantic (Kemp 2005). The other path involves perturbations to the extra-tropical depressions and hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico caused by changing the characteristics of the Saharan dust transported across the Atlantic.", "score": 0.825817585, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:79e57354-110a-4e5e-8b54-7bfed3950231>", "text": "Is the transport of heat northward by the Gulf Stream and North Atlantic Drift, and its subsequent release into the midlatitude westerlies, the reason why Europe's winters are so much milder than those of eastern North America and other places at the same latitude? Here, it is shown that the principal cause of this temperature difference is advection by the mean winds. South-westerlies bring warm maritime air into Europe and north-westerlies bring frigid continental air into north-eastern North America. Further, analysis of the ocean surface heat budget shows that the majority of the heat released during winter from the ocean to the atmosphere is accounted for by the seasonal release of heat previously absorbed and not by ocean heat-flux convergence. Therefore, the existence of the winter temperature contrast between western Europe and eastern North America does not require a dynamical ocean. Two experiments with an atmospheric general-circulation model coupled to an ocean mixed layer confirm this conclusion. The difference in winter temperatures across the North Atlantic, and the difference between western Europe and western North America, is essentially the same in these models whether or not the movement of heat by the ocean is accounted for. In an additional experiment with no mountains, the flow across the ocean is more zonal, western Europe is cooled, the trough east of the Rockies is weakened and the cold of north-eastern North America is ameliorated. In all experiments the west coast of Europe is warmer than the west coast of North America at the same latitude whether or not ocean heat transport is accounted for.

This type of pattern draws up humid, often hot air from Spain as the normal flow of weather is blocked by high pressure to our east.\nRemarkably, the location of tropical thunderstorm activity many thousands of miles away in the Tropics can have a significant influence on global weather patterns. This year we anticipate there to be an increase in levels of activity tied into an increase in solar activity and favourable conditions for storm development in the western and central Tropical Pacific Ocean tied into the weakening of La Nina. Where this activity becomes organised, a powerful influence on global weather patterns can arise. In this location, this is likely to reinforce the pattern of high pressure to the east and south of the UK and low pressure stalled in the Atlantic bringing southerly winds and hot often sultry weather interspersed by isolated thunderstorms.\nThe mean position of the jet stream (a band of high altitude winds steering weather systems across the globe) can be deflected by relatively warmer or cooler sea surface temperatures over a sustained period of weeks or even months.

Rising weather variability made it harder for farmers to adapt to changing climates, but often made it more profitable for Dutch merchants to trade grain. More frequent storms sank all manner of vessels but sometimes quickened journeys, too. Easterly winds gave advantages to Dutch fleets sailing into battle from the Dutch coast, but westerly winds benefitted English armadas.

Western North America also seems to have been relatively chilly in the seventeenth century, although there chillier temperatures probably did not set in during the 1640s.\nBy contrast, cooling was moderate or even non-existent across the northeastern United States. Chesapeake Bay, for instance, was warm for most of the seventeenth century, and only cooled in the eighteenth century. Glaciers advanced in the Canadian Rockies not in the seventeenth century, but rather during the early eighteenth century.

However, one of the chilliest periods of all – the Grindelwald Fluctuation, from 1560 to 1630 – actually unfolded during a modest rise in solar activity. Volcanic eruptions, it seems, also played an important role in bringing about cooler decades, as did the natural internal variability of the climate system. Both the absence of eruptions and a grand solar maximum likely set the stage for the Medieval Warm Period, which is now more commonly called the Medieval Climate Anomaly.\nThis gets to the heart of what we actually mean when we use a term like “Maunder Minimum” to refer to a period in Earth’s climate history. Are we talking about a period of low solar activity? Or are we referring to an especially cold climatic regime? Or are we talking about chilly temperatures and the changes in atmospheric circulation that cooling set in motion? In other words: what do we really mean when we say that the Maunder Minimum endured from 1645 to 1720? How does our choice of dates affect our understanding of relationships between climate change and human history in this period?\nTo find an answer to these questions, we can start by considering the North Sea region. This area has yielded some of the best documentary sources for climate reconstructions. They allow environmental historians like me to dig into exactly the kinds of weather that grew more common with the onset of the Maunder Minimum. In Dutch documentary evidence, for example, we see a noticeable cooling trend in average seasonal temperatures that begins around 1645. On the surface of things, it seems like declining solar activity and climate change are very strongly correlated.\nAnd yet, other weather patterns seem to change later, one or two decades after the onset of regional cooling. Weather variability from year to year, for example, becomes much more pronounced after around 1660, and that erraticism is often associated with the Maunder Minimum. Severe storms were more frequent only by the 1650s or perhaps the 1660s, and again, such storms are also linked to the Maunder Minimum climate.", "score": 0.818869412, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:3583c149-f88e-4748-8448-b484738cdade>", "text": "Some meteorologists have insisted that the severity of the drought in sub-Saharan West Africa and its long duration (nearly 40 years to date) must be a sign of a long-term alteration in climate.\nAmong the theories proposed to explain this change, one hypothesis that has gained widespread attention attributes the drought to a cooling of the Northern Hemisphere. This hypothesis is based on the fact that, between 1945 and the early 1970s, the average annual air temperatures over the landmasses of the Northern Hemisphere decreased by about half a degree Fahrenheit (approximately one quarter of a degree Celsius—a small but significant amount). Several meteorologists have suggested that this cooling was caused by an increase in atmospheric dust emanating from volcanic eruptions and from urban and industrial pollution; the dust reflected incoming sunlight,\ncausing the ground to receive less solar radiation and to transfer less heat to the atmosphere. The cooling seemed to be more pronounced in the middle and high latitudes than in the tropics, an observation that is consistent with the fact that the Sun’s rays enter the atmosphere at a greater angle farther north, and so have to pass through more dust-laden atmosphere on the way to the Earth.\nSince winds are set in motion by differences in air pressure caused by unequal heating of the atmosphere, supporters of the cooling hypothesis have argued that a growing temperature differential between the unusually cool middle and high latitudes and the warm tropical latitudes is causing a southward expansion of the circumpolar vortex—the high-altitude westerly winds that circle the Northern Hemisphere at middle latitudes.\nAccording to this hypothesis, as the circumpolar vortex expands, it forces south other components of large-scale atmospheric circulation and, in effect, displaces the northward-moving monsoon that ordinarily brings sub-Saharan rain. Proponents have further argued that this change in atmospheric circulation might be long-term since cooling in the Northern Hemisphere could be perpetuated by increases in ice and snow coverage there, which would lead to reflection of more sunlight away from the Earth, to further cooling, and, indirectly, to further drought in sub-Saharan West Africa.\nDespite these dire predictions, and even though the current African drought has lasted longer than any other in this century, the notion that the drought is caused by cooling of the Northern Hemisphere is, in fact, not well supported.", "score": 0.818286479, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:3504e0be-1f20-4313-b40b-aa594b9e43e5>", "text": "For comparison, the approximately 80-ppm rise in CO2 concentration at the end of the past ice ages generally took over 5,000 years. Higher values than at present have only occurred many millions of years ago (see FAQ 6.1).\nTemperature is a more difficult variable to reconstruct than CO2 (a globally well-mixed gas), as it does not have the same value all over the globe, so that a single record (e.g., an ice core) is only of limited value. Local temperature fluctuations, even those over just a few decades, can be several degrees celsius, which is larger than the global warming signal of the past century of about 0.7°C.\nMore meaningful for global changes is an analysis of large-scale (global or hemispheric) averages, where much of the local variation averages out and variability is smaller. Sufficient coverage of instrumental records goes back only about 150 years. Further back in time, compilations of proxy data from tree rings, ice cores, etc., go back more than a thousand years with decreasing spatial coverage for earlier periods (see Section 6.5). While there are differences among those reconstructions and significant uncertainties remain, all published reconstructions find that temperatures were warm during medieval times, cooled to low values in the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, and warmed rapidly after that. The medieval level of warmth is uncertain, but may have been reached again in the mid-20th century, only to have likely been exceeded since then. These conclusions are supported by climate modelling as well. Before 2,000 years ago, temperature variations have not been systematically compiled into large-scale averages, but they do not provide evidence for warmer-than-present global annual mean temperatures going back through the Holocene (the last 11,600 years; see Section 6.4). There are strong indications that a warmer climate, with greatly reduced global ice cover and higher sea level, prevailed until around 3 million years ago. Hence, current warmth appears unusual in the context of the past millennia, but not unusual on longer time scales for which changes in tectonic activity (which can drive natural, slow variations in greenhouse gas concentration) become relevant (see Box 6.1).\nA different matter is the current rate of warming.

The point is that the crust cannot be assumed to remain a fixed/extraneous item, while we model significant climate change going forward a century or two.\n(g) Volcanism is the major known earth-cooling effect. Arguably it is the only one with the capability to reverse a significant warming turning such warming into an ice-age, as the other potential cooling effects are minor in comparison, or very long term. [Every few hundred million years a major meteor strike has a somewhat similar effect as intensive volcanic activity, but as this is a truly random external effect, we can leave it aside for the purpose of climate modelling.] Accordingly, volcanism must be the prime suspect in terms of how to explain the geological record's history of high carbon dioxide periods resulting in global cooling.\nFurther proof of this thesis could be provided by volcanologists seeking to obtain data on a global scale as to any change in overall volcanic activity since before the Industrial Revolution. Most volcanologists study a particular volcano, or class of volcano, in the hope of developing methods to better predict eruptions. But perhaps individual eruptions are not what we need to fear! Perhaps more volcanologists need to work on world-scale predictive measures, rather than worrying about particular volcanoes. We need to track overall rates of volcanism by decade, in much the same way as we now actively track changes in global atmospheric and ocean temperatures by decade. However, as there is likely to be a very significant lag time between changes in atmospheric temperatures, and resultant changes in crust temperature and ice-loads - and hence crust tensions, it may well be that no measurable change in volcanism is to be expected yet - so soon after we have started our surface warming activities. However, if crust tension changes and levels of volcanism are to be expected (upon further proving of this theory), then even the potential that this theory could be true, is one further reason to attempt to minimise man's effects on our biosphere, before any flow-on effects can't be halted.\nThe major implication of this new thesis is that the current climate models need to be expanded (if practical) to take into account crust changes resulting from atmospheric and oceanic model changes.", "score": 0.1356668086434424, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:2bbd38c5-8bbb-42ec-b553-f3294c90c0f7>", "text": "The last 2.6 million years\nThe Quaternary is a subdivision of geological time (the Quaternary Period) which covers the last 2.6 million years up to the present day.

Indeed it was widely accepted by the 1860s that the action of glaciers had profoundly altered the surface of the earth over wide areas, including most of northern Europe and North America.

Scientists from the German Research Centre for Geosciences GFZ in collaboration with Swedish and Dutch colleagues provide evidence for a direct solar-climate linkage on centennial timescales. Using the most modern methodological approach, they analysed sediments from Lake Meerfelder Maar, a maar lake in the Eifel/Germany, to determine annual variations in climate proxies and solar activity.\nThe study published online this week in Nature Geosience (06/05/2012) reports the climatic change that occurred at the beginning of the pre-Roman Iron Age and demonstrates that especially the so-called Grand Minima of solar activity can affect climate conditions in western Europe through changes in regional atmospheric circulation pattern. Around 2800 years ago, one of these Grand Solar Minima, the Homeric Minimum, caused a distinct climatic change in less than a decade in Western Europe.\nThe exceptional seasonally laminated sediments from the studied maar lake allow a precise dating even of short-term climate changes. The results show for a 200 year long period strongly increased springtime winds during a period of cool and wet climate in Europe. In combination with model studies they suggest a mechanism that can explain the relation between a weak sun and climate change. \"The change and strengthening of the tropospheric wind systems likely is related to stratospheric processes which in turn are affected by the ultraviolet radiation\" explains Achim Brauer (GFZ), the initiator of the study. \"This complex chain of processes thus acts as a positive feedback mechanism that could explain why assumingly too small variations in solar activity have caused regional climate changes.\"\nUpdated below with MUST READ comments from Stephen Wilde & Piers Corbyn\n1 article found\nshowing page 1 of 1\n« previous 1 next »", "score": 0.0895896628444649, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:d2d23457-89ae-4917-a0fd-e725a2606a74>", "text": "A recent post at RealClimate by Matthew England discusses the results of his (and others’) recent paper (England et al. 2014, Recent intensification of wind-driven circulation in the Pacific and the ongoing warming hiatus, Nature Climate Change, doi:10.1038/nclimate2106) about changes in wind patterns in the tropical Pacific, their impact on ocean circulation, and the resulting impact on global temperature.\nEngland gives an excellent 1-paragraph summary thus:\nA consistent picture has now emerged to explain the slowdown in global average SAT since 2001 compared to the rapid warming of the 1980s and 1990s: this includes the link between hiatus decades and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation, the enhanced ocean heat uptake in the Pacific (see previous posts) and the role of East Pacific cooling.

The income projections for the next year vary depending on factors that are not in our control. Beverage sales, merchandise sales, and entry fees are all dependent upon the marketing of the events, weather, and interest of attendees. Sponsorships can grow, but that also can be variable depending upon the economy and the goals and objectives of certain companies.\nOther nonprofits use such income streams as supplementary items and rely upon traditional development and philanthropic efforts – supporting the mission of the organization through donations. This is different than a membership – membership programs benefit the individual. Philanthropic programs benefit society as a whole.\nMany festival organizations do not have such philanthropic efforts and it might be a way to build more sustainable dollars and help support the administrative side of the organization. But, how does an organization begin? Below are five steps to start the philanthropic effort.\n1. Engage your fans.\nThe fan or audience base is a great place to start to ask for donations. They know the festival and can appreciate the work that is done each year. In order to build up to asking for donations, the audience needs to be engaged through such means as email blasts and social media outlets. The more they know about the organization and the festival, the better.\n2. Determine why you want to raise money.\nAudiences today want to know specific goals and objectives. What is the community benefit of the festival and your organization? How does it improve the community? This is not the economic benefit to the city – it is measurable goals and objectives of a program that the festival implements to improve the community. This outreach can include programs in education, youth, safety , environment, history, or arts and culture. People want to solve problems and will give knowing that the money is being used for those efforts.\n3. Set infrastructure.\nIt is great to receive a donation, but what do you do when you receive it? Can you legally accept the gifts – do you have a separate 501-c(3) foundation if you are not one? Do you have software to track gifts? Do you have thank you processes in place? Do you have a database of names, addresses, phone numbers, and emails? Can you accept online gifts?

The festival everyone waits for is Summerfest, it’s Coachella on a budget.\nFor some reason, everyone wants to pay hundreds of dollars for a Coachella ticket, why not just pay $15 and walk from stage to stage to see some of your favorites. We do have a main stage (American Family Insurance Amphitheater) that has big performers. For example, Billie Eilish, Willie Nelson, Jennifer Lopez, Lionel RIchie, Snoop Dogg, Lil Wayne and more will be in the amphitheater. The amphitheater tickets are ordinary priced concert tickets, but the amphitheater ticket gets into the whole festival, no extra charge to walk to every other stage. Coachella has the ferris wheel, we have a sky glider. Are you too lazy or drunk to walk across the festival grounds? No biggie, get on the sky glider and look down on the many lost flip flops.\nThe other festivals showcase our cities amazing cultures; Pridefest, Irish Fest, Polish Fest, German Fest, and Mexican Fiesta are all set at one of the prettiest areas of Milwaukee, Lake Michigan at Henry W. Maier Festival Park (pictured below).\nThe festivals are just one way to entertain yourself in Milwaukee, but there’s so much more.

This excitement however also comes with an underline feeling of dread as you begin to think about how your summer circuit is going to affect your finances. I am writing this article to give the financially challenged among you some pointers on how you can maximize your festival fun while saving a few bucks in the process. If you are willing to put in a little work and have a little bit of forward planning you can reduce the cost of attending any music festival dramatically.\nWe are going to take a look at the three major money sinks of attending any festival at what you can do to reduce these costs. The three areas we are going to take a look at are food costs, transportation costs and the cost of the festival ticket itself. All the tips you will find here are tried and true and based off of personal experience. With them you will be able to stretch out those dollars and get the most bang for your buck.\nDepending on which festival you are attending the ticket price may be your biggest expense. There are a few things that you can do to reduce this cost or even eliminate it entirely. The first thing you should do is to follow all of your favorite festivals on social media. Most festivals nowadays have a social media presence and have pages on multiple social media platforms. Music festivals use these pages to announce things like when tickets will go on sale, and since most festivals sell tickets based on a tier system, the earlier you get your tickets the cheaper they will be. A lot of festivals also have ticket giveaways that require you to do nothing more than share a post and tag some friends, it’s obviously not guaranteed to reduce your costs but it doesn’t hurt to enter anyway. It will also put you in touch with attendees who may be selling tickets at lower prices and keep you informed on musical acts and schedules as well as informing you on application deadlines for things such as media and volunteering.\nAll festivals require a large amount of people power to keep them running smoothly. The vast majority of this people power comes from teams of dedicated volunteers who are willing to trade their time for free entry into the festival. The time commitment can be anywhere from 6 to 36 hours, depending on the festival, and some festivals will even provide you with a few free meals.", "score": 0.826756358, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:cdabc7e7-2afd-45e9-a7c1-feec49e04751>", "text": "DEMF.

In addition, the entire school district has fewer financial resources due to state imposed revenue caps. For these reasons, different approaches need to be utilized to further resources and strengthen partnerships with organizations that have similar goals.\nI am pleased to announce that the Madison Metropolitan School District and the University of Wisconsin-Madison have entered into a partnership that will strengthen recruitment efforts and solidify one years worth of funding for the Minority Services Coordinator (MSC) position. This position has been very vital to the School Boards goal of closing the achievement gap by working with racial and ethnic minority students since 1973. The position was created and developed by the late Joe Thomas of West High School. Without this partnership, the MSC position would have fallen victim to budget cuts.\nSuperintendent Rainwater shared these remarks with the entire school board:\nWe have entered into a partnership with the University of Wisconsin-Madison to share the services and funding of the Minority Services Coordinators in each of our high schools. This partnership will enable us to keep the Minority Services Coordinators in the schools and further enhance their ability to assist both us and the University with our minority students as they prepare to enter college.\nThis partnership is made possible because of the University of Wisconsin-Madison’s efforts to encourage post-secondary education for Wisconsin disadvantaged and minority students. The funding will come from the PEOPLE (Pre-college Enrichment Opportunity Program for Learning Excellence) Program currently serving approximately 800 high school and middle school students from public schools in Madison, Milwaukee, Racine, Waukesha, the Ho-Chunk Nation and the Menominee Nation.\nThe program emphasizes enrichment in math, science and writing, and incorporates technology as an integral part of the curriculum. Students build study skills and receive information on college preparation and testing, academic and career options, and other subjects to foster graduation from high school and success in college.\nThose who complete the pre-college portion of the program and are accepted for admission to UW-Madison receive a tuition scholarship for up to five years.

In other words, there’s no cohesion between touchpoints. If you really want to sell your USP to customers, you must present a consistent front.\n3. Don’t Overdo It\nSome companies think they’re developing a superior USP when they’re simply making a longer one. Complexity is not positively correlated to success. In fact, the simpler a USP is, the better the results normally are. Take Enterprise’s well-known USP as an example. All it says is: “Pick Enterprise. We’ll Pick You Up.” It’s short, specific, and powerful.\nPutting it All Together\n“A weak or nonexistent USP can ruin conversion rates, sales, and all the other good things that marketers crave,” internet marketer Neil Patel explains. “A clear, strong, and customer-focused USP will do just the opposite – boost conversions, create a fanatic tribe, and satisfy customers to the core.”\nHow are you doing in terms of conveying your USP to your target audience? Do you even have a USP? These are critically important questions with crucial answers.

However, many clinicians are unaware of this potentially dangerous adverse effect. Objective: To review reported cases of trimethoprim-induced hyperkalemia in immunocompetent patients and identify predisposing factors, treatment, and outcome. Methods: A MEDLINE literature search was performed using the key words ‘trimethoprim’ and ‘hyperkalemia’. All English-language case reports and bibliographies of immunocompetent patients with trimethoprim-induced hyperkalemia were reviewed. Results: Nine cases were identified. The mean patient age was 77.6 years, and the mean duration of therapy was 10.2 days. Seven patients received standard oral dosages of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for common infections, and 2 patients were concurrently receiving angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors. The mean pretreatment levels of creatinine and potassium were 1.01 mg/dl and 4.55 mmol/l, respectively. The mean peak serum potassium level was 7.0 mmol/l. No deaths attributable to hyperkalemia occurred. Conclusions: Hyperkalemia due to trimethoprim typically affects elderly patients administered standard oral dosages, even in the presence of a normal serum creatinine level. Concurrent angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor therapy may increase the risk of hyperkalemia. The prognosis is favorable with standard therapy for hyperkalemia and withdrawal of trimethoprim.\nMark A.

When meninges are inflamed, the drugs enter the CSF in levels of about 50% of those found in the serum. Both drugs cross the placenta and are distributed into milk. The volume of distribution for trimethoprim in various species are: 1.49 L/kg (dogs), and 0.59-1.51 L/kg (horses). The volume of distribution for sulfadiazine in dogs is 1.02 L/kg.\nTrimethoprim/sulfa is both renally excreted unchanged via glomerular filtration and tubular secretion and metabolized by the liver. The sulfas are primarily acetylated and conjugated with glucuronic acid and trimethoprim is metabolized to oxide and hydroxylated metabolites. Trimethoprim may be more extensively metabolized by the liver in adult ruminants than in other species. The serum elimination half-lives for trimethoprim in various species are: 2.5 hours (dogs), 1.91-3 hours (horses), 1.5 hours (cattle). The serum elimination half-lives for sulfadiazine in various species are: 9.84 hours (dogs), 2.71 hours (horses), 2.5 hours (cattle). While trimethoprim is quite rapidly eliminated from the serum, the drug may persist for a longer period of time in tissues.\nBecause of the number of variables involved it is extremely difficult to apply pharmacokinetic values in making dosage recommendations with these combinations.

Many patients believe that having been labelled 'sulfur allergic' they are also at risk of adverse reactions or allergies from sulfites, sulfates and even elemental sulfur and may attempt to avoid them. Sulfates are sometimes mildly irritant and sulfites can cause respiratory reactions in patients with asthma and, rarely, non-immunoglobulin E-mediated anaphylactic reactions, but there is no relationship between these reactions and hypersensitivity to sulfonamides. Patients who have had allergic reactions to sulfonamide drugs do not need to avoid sulfites, sulfates or sulfur.\nAs a general principle, all allergic adverse reactions to medications should be recorded in the patient's file with the specific name of the drug or drugs to which the patient has reacted and the nature of the reaction. Allergies should not be attributed to classes or groups of drugs unless proven because assumptions about cross-reactivity may later be found to be incorrect.", "score": 0.816699266, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:1586ba8a-cd96-4e96-99ef-6773e92e8306>", "text": "Hypersensitivity reactions and hematologic effects (anemias, thrombocytopenia, or leukopenias) may also be seen; long term therapy should include periodic hematologic monitoring.\nOverdosage/Acute Toxicity – Manifestations of an acute overdosage can include symptoms of GI distress (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea), CNS toxicity (depression, headache, and confusion), facial swelling, bone marrow depression and increases in serum aminotransferases. Oral overdoses can be treated by emptying the stomach (following usual protocols) and initiating symptomatic and supportive therapy. Acidification of the urine may increase the renal elimination of trimethoprim, but could also cause sulfonamide crystalluria, particularly with sulfadiazine containing products. Complete blood counts (and other laboratory parameters) should be monitored as necessary. Bone marrow suppression associated with chronic overdoses may be treated with folinic acid (leucovorin) if severe. Peritoneal dialysis is not effective in removing TMP or sulfas from the circulation.\nDrug Interactions – Trimethoprim/sulfa may prolong the clotting times in patients receiving coumarin (warfarin) anticoagulants. Sulfonamides may displace other highly bound drugs, such as methotrexate, phenylbutazone, thiazide diuretics, salicylates, probenicid and phenytoin. Although the clinical significance of these interactions is not entirely clear, patients should be monitored for enhanced effects of the displaced agents. Antacids may decrease the bioavailability of sulfonamides if administered concurrently. Trimethoprim may decrease the therapeutic effect of cyclosporine (systemic) and increase the risk of nephrotoxicity developing.\nDrug/Laboratory Interactions – When using the Jaffe alkaline picrate reaction assay for creatinine determination, trimethoprim/sulfa may cause an overestimation of approximately 10%. Sulfonamides may give false-positive results for urine glucose determinations when using the Benedict’s method.\nNote: There is significant controversy regarding the frequency of dosing these drugs.

QT interval prolongation is directly related to Dofetilide plasma concentration. Factors such as reduced creatinine clearance or certain Dofetilide drug interactions will increase Dofetilide plasma concentration. The risk of TdP can be reduced by controlling the plasma concentration through adjustment of the initial Dofetilide dose according to creatinine clearance and by monitoring the ECG for excessive increases in the QT interval.\nTreatment with Dofetilide must therefore be started only in patients placed for a minimum of three days in a facility that can provide electrocardiographic monitoring and in the presence of personnel trained in the management of serious ventricular arrhythmias.

Bacteria cannot absorb folic acid, but must make it from PABA (para-aminobenzoic acid), pteridine, and glutamate. For humans, folic acid is a vitamin. We cannot synthesize it. This makes this metabolic pathway a nice, selective target for antimicrobial agents.\nThis figure presents the synthesis of folic acid, for review.\nSulfonamides and trimethoprim inhibit synthesis of folate at two different sites.\nThe sulfonamides are structurally similar to PABA and block the incorporation of PABA into dihydropteroic acid. Trimethoprim prevents reduction of dihydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase. This enzyme is present in humans, but trimethoprim has a lower affinity for the human enzyme. There are other examples of folate reductase inhibitors that we will consider later (pyrimethamine and methotrexate).\nThe combination of sulfonamides and trimethoprim is synergistic, and they are rarely used alone. Sulfamethoxazole is the sulfonamide used in combination with trimethoprim because they have matching half-lives.\nThere are other sulfonamides; please check your textbook. Note that sulfasalazine is also used to treat inflammatory bowel disease (see Chapter 42).\nThese folate antagonists are broad-spectrum agents that are effective against gram-positive and gram-negative organisms.\nThe combination of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim, called cotrimoxazole, is probably the most commonly used drug in this group.

Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole are both compounds that block the internal production of folic acid.

Blood vessels are largest close to the heart and become progressively smaller, terminating in a network of extremely fine capillaries that meander through the body tissues. The blood of a fish, like blood in all vertebrates, is composed of plasma (fluid) and blood cells (solid). A fish’s circulatory system is much simpler than that of a human. In humans, the blood is pumped from the heart into the lungs, where it is oxygenated; it then returns to the heart and receives a good thrust to travel throughout the body. In contrast, fish blood passes from the heart to the gills for purification and then travels directly to all other parts of the body. Fish are often referred to as “cold-blooded” creatures, but this is not entirely true.", "score": 0.828925431, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:924f0c0f-085b-4780-891f-8b6f817c861d>", "text": "The number and shape of these teeth are important keys in grouping of molluscs.

A complete gut performs digestion, a large and complex kidney is responsible for excretion, while gas exchange is done through a pair of gills. Their nervous system is well developed and centralized in a brain. Most molluscs have separate sexes, but there are exceptions most notably the nudibranchs that are hermaphrodites. Adults develop from the characteristic trochophore larva, some form an additional larval stage, called veliger.\nChitons form an exclusively marine class, its name, Polyplacophora, means “many plate bearer”. Their architecture is quite primitive compared to other molluscs. The flattened, elongated body has a ventral foot and eight dorsal shell plates that are embedded in a thickened region of the mantle, called the girdle. Sometimes the plates are partially or totally covered by the girdle. The butterfly shaped plates, often found washed up on beaches, give their body flexibility, so that they can roll into a ball when attacked. They have no tentacles, but can sense light with ocelli. Almost all chitons are herbivores. Chitons are often found in intertidal areas.

Many animals in this group of molluscs under go torsion, a strange 180 degrees twist of the body above the foot, unique in the animal kingdom to gastropods. Torsion takes place during development in the veliger larval form.

The seven external gill slits are easily seen forming a short line along both sides of the branchial region. Each gill slit is a more of less circular pore (which is probably closed) posterior to a U-shaped depression in the body wall, which may superficially appear to be another gill slit.

We use the term “educational content” to refer to the structured content of training placed in the information-educational environment and presented using an electronic educational resource (Ilchenko, 2002).

Let us consider them more closely. First of all, the educational content should take into account the principle of consistency.

The next step in utilizing these more culturally based understandings of schools and curricula is to apply this thinking to diverse schools and classrooms more specifically. Educators in schools across the country—some isolated in single classrooms and some working on a school-wide set of pedagogical reforms—are starting to grapple with these issues in racially and ethnically diverse classrooms. Some of these efforts are documented in studies of the de-tracking movement and the work on civics education noted above, but far more research on the “how” dimensions of these pedagogical efforts is needed.105\nDemographic, Educational, and Political Forces Fostering the Benefits of Diversity within the K–12 Educational System\nThe fact that the educational benefits of racially and ethnically diverse campuses and classrooms has been a more central argument and defining theme of higher education jurisprudence, leadership, and research than it has in the area of K–12 research and policy is problematic, given the added attention generally to issues of teaching and learning in the K–12 literature. But as we highlight in Figure 1, there are several reasons why issues related to the educational benefits of diversity appear to have fallen off the K–12 research radar screen in the last twenty-five years. This includes, most notably, a highly fragmented and segregated K–12 educational system of entrenched between-district segregation that cannot be easily addressed after Milliken v. Bradley. Meanwhile, this fragmented and segregated educational system is governed by accountability and legal mandates that give no credence to the educational benefits of learning in diverse contexts. As noted above, several areas of research on the sociocultural issues related to teaching students of different racial and ethnic backgrounds that could help inform our understanding of the pedagogical approaches that foster educational benefits of diversity in the K–12 system are disconnected, often designed to address the needs of students in the racially segregated school system they attend.", "score": 0.022818504174739532, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:7d57787d-c4db-4116-a698-50001f46699f>", "text": "Historic newspapers are excellent primary resources for use in K-12 classrooms, especially for activities meeting Oregon Common Core standards in Social Sciences and English Language Arts.

Once you have dealt with each one of these factors, you will have a large part of the battle behind you.\nNow, to make sure that you understand, even though you may have control of each of these elements, you still have to deal with the damage the virus has caused, the secondary infections, the compromised/weakened immune system, and so forth.\nSo, your dog will not be out of the woods if, let’s say, you find a way to control the vomiting. All of the other problems must be addressed at the same time in order to pull your dog through this nightmare.\nParvo is a large problem that you cannot underestimate. This virus is very resourceful and is always figuring out ways to defeat whatever you throw at it. A passive or inactive approach will certainly have a large cost. The key here is to be very observant and react quickly.

Potential cost of not fully vaccinating your puppy first: several days in the veterinary hospital, thousands of dollars in intensive-care fees … and still no guarantee your puppy will survive.\nMany new pet owners face this shocking and unfortunate situation. Millions of puppies world-wide are at risk of contracting the highly contagious, deadly canine parvovirus. This common virus, which targets both young and unvaccinated dogs, has spread rapidly throughout Canada since its emergence in the late-1970s.\nThe virus’s structure makes it highly resistant to changes in the environment such as temperature and pH, in addition to allowing it to withstand the most common disinfectants. Not only is canine parvovirus hard to kill, it has evolved into more resistant and deadlier forms over the years. Found all throughout the indoor and outdoor environment, the virus enters a dog’s mouth and nose as it sniffs, licks and explores the world. From there, the virus quickly infects the internal organs, where it replicates. It then exits the body through vomit and feces, contaminating new areas and surfaces.\nResearchers from the University of Saskatchewan’s Western College of Veterinary Medicine (WCVM) are looking to find out what factors affect the survival of infected dogs. The goal is to improve treatment and reduce the costs of animals’ long veterinary hospital stays.\n“Parvovirus is still a significant cause of illness in puppies,” says Dr. Kevin Cosford, small animal internal medicine specialist at the University’s veterinary teaching hospital in Saskatoon. “Some patients do not survive, despite extensive treatment. Many puppies survive due to the tireless efforts of veterinary staff during prolonged hospital stays.”\nThe cost of that treatment can be significant.\nA deadly, costly illness\nCanine parvovirus attacks the cells lining the small intestine, producing a flu-like illness. It also targets the bone marrow — an organ critical to the body’s ability to defend itself against bacteria and other invaders. With canine parvovirus, what may initially look like a harmless stomach ache following a bad meal quickly snowballs into severe dehydration, illness and possibly death.\nAlthough the virus primarily targets young puppies, it can infect and kill unvaccinated dogs of all ages.\nWith proper treatment and close monitoring, the vast majority of dogs are able to return home after recovery.", "score": 0.858755112, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:7854d990-296b-4ed8-87b2-e5e6b0343fa4>", "text": "Parvovirus in Rats\nParvoviral infection is a highly contagious but rarely encountered viral disease in rats.

The disease is fatal if it is not treated with supportive care and drug therapy, including antibiotics to combat further infection.\nA Dangerous Disease for Dogs\nCanine parvovirus is a particularly hardy and highly aggressive virus that causes a potentially fatal infection in dogs. Dogs under six months of age who have not yet achieved immunity through vaccination against the disease are the most commonly afflicted. The virus infiltrates cells in your dog’s intestines and bone marrow. White blood cells are destroyed, breaking down your dog’s ability to fight off bacterial infection. The symptoms of canine parvovirus include severe lethargy, loss of appetite and putrid-smelling diarrhea that may contain obvious amounts of blood. Dogs with this illness may vomit, and their abdomens may appear tightly pulled in as they tense in discomfort. Patients quickly dehydrate and decline rapidly, and death will result if no medical intervention is promptly administered.\nSupportive Care and Treatment\nCanine parvovirus requires several days of hospitalization and intensive care. Because parvovirus is a contagious disease, your dog will be placed in isolation, away from other patients. He will receive intravenous fluid therapy to combat dehydration that results from extensive vomiting and diarrhea. In addition to the lactated ringers solution, potassium may also be infused to aid in maintaining your dog’s electrolyte balance. Dextrose may be added to the fluid bag for smaller dogs that are prone to hypoglycemia, especially since a dog with canine parvovirus is unable to take in food. Injectable anti-nausea drugs, such as metoclopramide, will be administered. Your vet will run blood tests to monitor your dog’s white cell count and blood protein levels. Antibiotics will also be administered to help assist your dog’s immune system.\nCommonly Used Antibiotics\nYour dog’s intestine normally houses bacteria. When the parvovirus attacks the intestine, it causes ulceration of the tissues. Once this occurs, bacteria leak from the intestines into the bloodstream. To prevent sepsis, antibiotics must be given.", "score": 0.858154476, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:4ceaf19a-3f4e-4acb-9952-37083ba725f2>", "text": "What is ULTRA Duramune DAP?\nULTRA Duramune DAP has been shown to be effective for vaccination of healthy dogs 6 weeks of age or older against canine distemper, infectious canine hepatitis, canine adenovirus type 2 and canine parvovirus (CPV).

The virus is highly infectious. The virus does not persist in immunocompetent hosts.\nClinical Signs and Lesions\nMost rats will show clinical signs within a few days of their first exposure to SDAV. SDAV has a tropism for tubuloalveolar glandular tissue of serous or mucous/serous glands. Consequently, SDAV infection results in damage to lacrimal, salivary, and Harderian glands. In epizootic infections, animals present with sniffling, sneezing, photophobia, chromodacryorrhea, and submandibular swelling. Morbidity is high, but mortality is low. In enzootically infected colonies, clinical signs are absent or very mild. Sequelae to SDAV infection include megaloglobus, corneal ulceration, and hyphema secondary to the damage to the lacrimal glands. Other strains, historically referred to as rat coronavirus (RCV), have a respiratory tropism and can cause inflammation, generally mild, of the respiratory tract from the nose to the lungs. Immunodeficient rats can be persistently infected, and the infection presents with severe clinical signs and may be fatal.\nEnzootic SDAV infections are usually diagnosed by the use of serology (ELISA, IFA, MFIA™). Epizootic infections may be diagnosed by a combination of the pathognomonic clinical signs and histopathology in animals in the first week of infection, and serology after 7-10 days of infection. PCR is also available for salivary or lacrimal tissue of acutely infected rats.\nInterference with Research\nNaïve animals infected with SDAV become ill, rendering them unfit experimental subjects. Animals are usually anorectic and lose weight. SDAV may affect reproduction by increasing pre- and post-natal mortality.

During this time, the virus attacks the tonsils and lymph nodes inside the throat and invades white blood cells, rapidly dividing into multiple virus copies before entering the bloodstream.\nOnce there, the virus attacks the bone marrow, where it destroys immune cells and weakens the immune system. It also attacks the lining of the small intestine, breaking down the barrier that protects the gut from bacterial infection and fluid loss.\n- Stage 3: Signs of illness appear as the dog responds to the attack on their gastrointestinal tract with nausea and vomiting. Severe diarrhea soon follows. Without quick intervention, the dog may die from a combination of dehydration, shock to the system and septic toxins being released into the bloodstream.\nHow to Test for Parvo in Dogs\nThere is no at-home test or diagnostic procedure for parvo.

As an enveloped virus, it probably does not remain infectious in the environment for more than a few days and is susceptible to detergents, disinfectants, drying, and ethanol. If animals must be kept, euthanasia of all non-essential animals and a strict quarantine (negative pressure isolators work well in this case) is recommended until the animals can be rederived. Hysterectomy rederivation or embryo transfer are recommended to rederive infected colonies. “Burn out” of an SDAV infection through deliberate spread of infection and cessation of breeding until all rats are infected and have had time to clear the virus has also been shown to be effective for immunocompetent rats.\nBaker DG.

This viral infection causes inflammation of the intestines in dogs and puppies, resulting in acute diarrhea. In rarer cases, parvo in puppies also causes inflammation of the heart, or myocarditis, which can result in heart failure.\nParvo first appeared in Europe in the late 1970s. It’s believed to be a genetic mutation of feline panleukopenia virus (FPV), a type of parvovirus that affects cats. Canine parvovirus can not only infect dogs, but also spreads among wild canine species like wolves and coyotes, as well as foxes, skunks and raccoons.\nHow Do Dogs Get Parvo?\nDogs can get parvo if they come into direct contact with infected feces or with an infected dog. But they can also get it indirectly if they come into contact with an object or surface that has been contaminated by feces infected with CPV, which can live inside of fecal matter for up to three weeks.\nThe virus can also spread on surfaces in kennels, food and water bowls, collars and leashes and clothing of people who have handled infected dogs. Under the right conditions, parvovirus can survive on surfaces up to a year.\nWhich Dogs are Most At Risk for Parvo?\nUnvaccinated puppies and dogs who haven’t been fully vaccinated against parvo comprise the most vulnerable group. “Any dog can be infected, but those that are very young, very old, have compromised immune systems, or that are under or unvaccinated have the highest risk,” says Dr.", "score": 0.0009396364662182064, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:80b0b672-e885-442d-ad2c-9fc8d493e9ba>", "text": "Jamie Whittenburg, D.V.M., veterinarian director for Senior Tail Waggers, an educational website about aging pets.\n“Dogs that go outside of the home to public spaces, such as dog parks, are at higher risk of encountering the virus,” Whittenburg says. It’s also believed some dog breeds are at increased risk of contracting parvo, including:\n- American pit bull terriers\n- Doberman pinschers\n- English springer spaniels\n- German shepherds\n- Labrador retrievers\nHow Long are Dogs With Parvo Contagious?\nDogs who have been exposed to parvo can start transmitting the virus two weeks before they start showing signs or symptoms. They continue to be contagious for up to two weeks after recovery.\nThis is why it’s important to isolate your dog if there is any likelihood that they could have contracted parvo. Keep a close eye on them and contact your vet immediately if they develop symptoms.\nWhat Is the Life Expectancy of Dogs With Parvo?\nWithout treatment, parvo is usually fatal. Dogs and puppies typically die within 48 to 72 hours of developing symptoms.\nThat said, the majority of dogs and puppies who receive proper care and treatment recover within a week and go on to live healthy lives. “Older, healthy, partially vaccinated and larger dogs tend to have a better prognosis,” Whittenberg says. “Treatment received also matters. Those that are treated early in the course of the disease, and aggressively, tend to fare better.”\nSymptoms and Behaviors of Dogs With Parvo\nDogs who’ve contracted parvo can be asymptomatic, meaning they show no symptoms of the disease, although remain contagious. Stress may trigger symptoms to appear, and other digestive infections can make symptoms worse.\nIt’s also important to note that symptoms of parvo can be caused by other health conditions. Veterinary testing is required to accurately diagnose canine parvovirus. Because of the seriousness of this disease, you should contact a vet as soon as your dog exhibits symptoms.\nThe first signs of parvo in puppies and dogs include:\n- Reduced appetite\nAs the disease quickly progresses, these more serious symptoms soon follow:\n- Severe diarrhea\n- Blood or mucus in stool\n- Abdominal pain\nIs Parvo Treatment Covered by Pet Insurance?\nWhether parvo is covered by pet insurance depends on what your specific plan covers.", "score": 0.0007294859167248299, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:f4b64dec-2d4a-4a51-81d2-f450e0a1168b>", "text": "So, your dog needs some grooming, a bit of TLC to make her look her best, so you do what most dog owners do and decide to take her to the dog grooming salon.\nWhen you get there, you are reassured to find that they will only groom dogs that are fully up-to-date on all of their shots (e.g. Parvo, Kennel Cough / Bordetella).\nAnd so, you leave your doggie there for a bit of pampering, safe in the knowledge that she won’t, at least, get sick while she’s there.\nWell, we hate to burst your balloon, but even though dog groomers may have the best of intentions, your dog is not as safe as you thought!\nYou see, the problem is that Parvo vaccinations are no guarantee that your dog won’t get Parvo.\nWe hear, on a daily basis, about dogs getting Parvo regardless of their age – i.e. both puppies and adults, some as old as 14 – and regardless of whether they have been vaccinated or not.\nIn fact, it’s even worse than that, because an increasingly common problem is dogs developing full-blown Parvo symptoms within a couple of days (and sometimes even a few hours) of being vaccinated.\nNow, vets will probably tell you that this is just coincidence, or that the dog must have already had Parvo when they were vaccinated (in which case, even the vaccine manufacturers tell vets not to vaccinate the dog, although most vets ignore this advice, in their pursuit of more of your hard-earned cash, and probably won’t even do a Parvo test first).\nHowever, when people ring us practically every day of the week with stories such as this, we have to believe that the vaccines themselves are causing the Parvo.\nIf you think about it, the vaccines contain millions of viral particles (far more than most dogs would ever come across naturally in the wild), as well as a toxic cocktail of chemicals that can destroy their immune system completely, for maybe two weeks.\nSo, not only is your dog now full of the virus (and maybe other viruses too if he was given a 4-in-1, or even a 7-in-1, shot), but his immune system is compromised at best, and non-existent at worst.\nIs it any wonder that more and more dogs are succumbing to Parvo and other ailments, such as pneumonia, as a direct result of being vaccinated?\nBack to grooming your dog, then.", "score": 0.0006902818982839876, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:13546b58-3348-4341-a4b8-a5f2f3c32c00>", "text": "PROVIDENCE — The Providence Animal Shelter has shut down for seven days after six dogs came down with parvovirus, and dozens more are at risk of being euthanized because of the highly contagious disease.\nThe six ill dogs were euthanized by a veterinarian, according to David Holden, the director of the Providence Animal Shelter.\nThe disease is transmitted by oral contact with infected feces. Parvo can be carried on the dog’s hair and feet, as well as on contaminated crates, shoes, mats and other objects. When the dog licks the fecal material off hair, feet, or anything that came in contact with infected feces, it acquires the disease.\nAlthough parvo affects dogs of all ages, it occurs mostly in puppies 6 to 20 weeks old. It does not affect humans. The parvovirus attacks rapidly dividing cells in the body such as are found in bone marrow and the lining of the intestinal tract. That leads to a ravaged gastrointestinal system that results in severe, bloody diarrhea and vomiting.\nHolden said that the shelter closed on Monday after a dog there came down with parvo. By state law the shelter must close for a seven-day quarantine, neither taking in animals nor letting them out. While the shelter was closed, other dogs became infected with the disease, the latest of them on Friday.

A typical cheeseboard may contain four to six cheeses, for example: Mature Cheddar or Comté (hard: cow's milk cheeses); Brie or Camembert (soft: cow's milk); a blue cheese such as Stilton (hard: cow's milk), Roquefort (medium: ewe's milk) or Bleu d'Auvergne (medium-soft cow's milk); a soft/medium-soft goat's cheese (e.g. Sainte-Maure de Touraine, Pantysgawn, Crottin de Chavignol).  A cheeseboard 70 feet (21 m) long was used to feature the variety of cheeses manufactured in Wisconsin,  where the state legislature recognizes a \" cheesehead\" hat as a state symbol. \nThe nutritional value of cheese varies widely. Cottage cheese may consist of 4% fat and 11% protein while some whey cheeses are 15% fat and 11% protein, and triple-crème cheeses are 36% fat and 7% protein.  In general, cheese is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of calcium, protein, phosphorus, sodium and saturated fat.", "score": 0.833161235, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:46eb9096-2254-4be1-b002-ca17779db6c2>", "text": "Locally smoked salmon with scrambled egg.

The recipe we are following comes from 1867 and was written down by Augusta Hall – it comes from her book which is said to contain the recipes communicated to ‘The Traveller’ by the ‘Welsh Hermit’ of the Cell of St Cover in Gwent … “Once upon a time, not very long ago, there was an aged Welshman who lived in a house cut out of a rock adjoining the cell and opposite the Well of St. Cover (in Gwent). He was always called the Hermit (Meudwy) by his Cambrian countrymen, and had been remarkable in his youth for acquiring a practical knowledge of whatever art he deemed it useful to understand”.\nWithin this amusing and strange book is a recipe for Caws Bobi, (or Caws Pobi – a more common name) which is a Welsh version of ‘Cheese on Toast’ or Welsh Rabbit or Welsh Rarebit, (depending on how you think it should be spelt or pronounced). In 1867 Augusta Hall says this dish was recognised as the ‘celebrated national dish of Wales’. Whether this is true or not, other dishes should probably claim that title, Caws Bobi is a wonderful dish, particularly if made with Welsh Cheese.\nCaws Wedi Ei Bobi Recipe\nEnough for 2 people.\n- 4 thick slices of fresh bread\n- 200g Caerphilly Cheese\n- 60g butter\nCut thick slices of bread (3cm thick) from a fresh loaf. Put them under the grill to toast on both sides until golden brown.

Put the toast back under the grill until the cheese melts and slightly blisters. Serve hot.\nShould this dish be called Bobi or Pobi, Rabbit or Rarebit? Different spellings and pronunciations down the years have made this an almost impossible task to sort out.

The water and grenadine cut the stronger flavors of the pastis, and yet the pastis still predominated. The amount of water in the drink made it really refreshing and hydrating with a touch of flavor from the other ingredients. Great for a hot day outside, after work, maybe served with a little ice to chill it.\nNext up was le perroquet, sort of. My mint syrup wasn’t really green, and the pastis was colorless. The perroquet is supposed to be green, like a parakeet (hence the name), but the mint and pastis mixture was clear, so we skipped it, and I skipped ahead to la feuille morte—that’s 1 part pastis, 1/2 part grenadine, 1/2 part mint syrup, and 5 parts water. The color should approximate that of a dead leaf—again, hence the name. But again, because my mint syrup was so pale, the drink was just red like the tomate.\nThe mint added complexity. We both felt that although the tomate was refreshing it was ultimately a little dull. The feuille morte was better, but still not quite what we’re used to drinking. I still think this will be a good drink on a hot day, but otherwise, it didn’t send me.\nBy this time, we were up for serious drinking.

The most fun part of this project is discovering that steeping some spices and bark in a jar for just a few days can produce such a rich flavor.\nThe French manufacturers of pastis take pride in making pure products made with first-rate ingredients and traditional methods. But as much as I enjoy and appreciate that level of craftsmanship, it shows in the price tag. So I like to have a bottle of Pernod as my fancy-time pastis and a homemade batch of everyday pastis.\nThere is one drawback to the homemade stuff if you want to serve it simply mixed with water rather than adding it to a cocktail. DIY pastis doesn't dramatically \"louche,\" or turn cloudy white when water is added. That reaction comes from anise oils not dissolving in water, so it's possible that subbing in a bit of anise oil could make a homemade pastis that would louche. But anise oil is pretty expensive, so it seemed to defeat part of the benefit of making it at home, considering how the much more affordable dried pods gave such strong and lovely anise flavor.\nGet the Recipe\nThe true test of DIY pastis was using it in my favorite cocktail, the Sazerac.

Once the baby is born its lungs must now provide the oxygen needed for survival, but with pulmonary atresia there is no opening on the pulmonary valve for blood to get to the lungs and become oxygenated. Due to this, the newborn baby is blue in color and pulmonary atresia can usually be diagnosed within hours or minutes after birth.[medical citation needed]\nThe treatment of pulmonary atresia consists of: an IV medication called prostaglandin E1, which is used for treatment of pulmonary atresia, as it stops the ductus arteriosus from closing, allowing mixing of the pulmonary and systemic circulations, but prostaglandin E1 can be dangerous as it can cause apnea. Another example of preliminary treatment is heart catheterization to evaluate the defect or defects of the heart; this procedure is much more invasive. Ultimately, however, the individual will need to have a series of surgeries to improve the blood flow permanently. The first surgery will likely be performed shortly after birth. A shunt can be created between the aorta and the pulmonary artery to help increase blood flow to the lungs. As the child grows, so does the heart and the shunt may need to be revised in order to meet the body's requirements.\nThe type of surgery recommended depends on the size of the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery, if the right ventricle is small and unable to act as a pump, the surgery performed would be the Fontan procedure. In this three-stage procedure, the right atrium is disconnected from the pulmonary circulation. The systemic venous return goes directly to the lungs, by-passing the heart.Very young children with elevated pulmonary vascular resistance may not able to undergo the Fontan procedure. Cardiac catheterization may be done to determine the resistance before going ahead with the surgery.\nThe prognosis for pulmonary atresia varies for every child, if the condition is left uncorrected it may be fatal, but the prognosis has greatly improved over the years for those with pulmonary atresia.

The valve is completely closed thereby obstructing the outflow of blood from the heart to the lungs. The pulmonary valve is located on the right side of the heart between the right ventricle and pulmonary artery. In a normal functioning heart, the opening to the pulmonary valve has three flaps that open and close\nIn congenital heart defects such as pulmonary atresia, one finds that these structural abnormalities can include the valves of the heart, as well as, the walls and arteries/veins near the heart muscle. Consequently, blood flow due to the aforementioned structural abnormalities, is affected, either by blocking or altering the flow of blood through the human cardiac muscle.\nThere are two types of pulmonary atresia.\n- Pulmonary Atresia with Intact Ventricular Septum (PA-IVS) is a rare congenital malformation. PA-IVS involves complete blockage of the pulmonary valve located on the right side of the heart. This blockage prevents the flow of blood to the lungs. Because of this lack of blood flowing through the right side of the heart, the structures on that side, such as the pulmonary valve and the tricuspid valve, are abnormally small.\n- Pulmonary atresia with Ventricular Septal Defect (PA-VSD) is identified by underdevelopment of the right ventricle. The Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD) is a second opening in the ventricular wall, which provides a way out for blood in the right ventricle. When this second opening does not exist, very little blood goes to the right ventricle, which is what causes it to be underdeveloped in PA-IVS, this defect can be determined before birth.\nIn the case of pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect, one finds that decreased pulmonary blood flow may cause associated defects such as:\nIn terms of the cause of pulmonary atresia, there is uncertainty as to what instigates this congenital heart defect. Potential risk factors that can cause this congenital heart defect are those the pregnant mother may come in contact with, such as:\nIn regards to the diagnosis of pulmonary atresia the body requires oxygenated blood for survival.", "score": 0.836404264, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:302f5c97-3dbc-41d0-b45f-5cfa1ff82e09>", "text": "Pulmonary Atresia with VSD and MAPCAs3D Model\nThis is a 3D model from a neonate with pulmonary atresia, ventricular septal defect (VSD), and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCAs).

Another drug, called prostaglandin, which is given by IV, can help keep the ductus arteriosus open.

This means that no blue (deoxygenated) blood passes through the right side of the heart to the lungs.\nA hole (atrial septal defect) forms between the right and left collecting chambers (atria) and the blue blood passes into the left side of the heart and mixes with the red (oxygenated) blood and passes through the left side of the heart. Some of the blood then leaves the heart via the body artery (aorta) and some passes through a hole (ventricular septal defect) between the left and right pumping chambers (ventricles) into the right side of the heart where it is then pumped to the lungs via the lung artery (pulmonary artery). The circulation to the lungs is aided, before birth, by a connection between the lung and body arteries (patent ductus arteriosus).

These uncommon lesions arise from aberrations in normal aerodigestive tract development, which begins during the fourth week of fetal life when the lung bud forms at the caudal end of a groove in the primordial pharynx. An initial phase of sequential airway branching occurs until as many as 20–25 generations are reached by the 16th week of fetal life. These branches are divided into three zones: a proximal conductive zone (branches 1–16), an intermediate transitional zone (branches 17–19), and a distal respiratory zone (branches 20–25). A second canalicular phase is then entered as capillaries develop in the distal air passages.\nAtresia of the tracheobronchial tree can occur at any level and may involve an isolated segment or multiple diffuse areas of the airway. Tracheal atresia is associated with polyhydramnios, prematurity, esophageal atresia, tracheoesophageal fistula. Typically, neonates present with intractable cyanosis and despite a normal-appearing larynx are unable to be intubated. Emergency tracheostomy can be life-sustaining in babies with isolated subglottic atresia; in other infants with more diffuse disease, mask ventilation can achieve some palliation through anomalous esophagobronchial connections. Diffuse airway involvement, however, is invariably fatal.\nIsolated bronchial atresia results in a bronchus that ends in a blind pouch. A mucocele develops distal to the obstruction and, as a result of compression of neighboring normal bronchial structures, causes emphysematous changes in the surrounding lung. Since children frequently develop wheezing, stridor, and pulmonary infections in the involved segments, resection is almost always indicated.

In all group II cases, aortic arch anomalies were encountered, a finding not duly emphasized in previous reports. Comparison of the two groups revealed significant clinical and laboratory differences. Group II patients typically presented with severe congestive heart failure and expired within the first 2 months of life. Group I patients usually presented with mild congestive heart failure which responded to therapy.

The term \"tetrology\" comes from the Greek word for \"four\". The four problems are: pulmonary stenosis (PS), ventricular septal defect (VSD), overriding of the aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy.\nTransposition of the Great Arteries\nIn transposition of the great arteries, the aorta comes off the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle. The aorta will then take unoxygenated blood back to the body, before it can flow to the lungs for oxygen. The pulmonary artery takes blood from the left side of the heart back to the lungs. Infants born with transposition of the great arteries will be blue or \"cyanotic\" at birth or soon after birth, because unoxygenated blood is being delivered to the body.\nTricuspid atresia is a birth defect of the heart where the valve that controls blood flow from the right upper chamber of the heart to the right lower chamber of the heart doesn’t form at all. In babies with this defect, blood can’t flow correctly through the heart and to the rest of the body. In tricuspid atresia, the tricuspid valve is not present. The only way for blue blood to get to the right ventricle is through a hole in the wall between the right and left atria. This hole, called atrial septal defect, allows oxygen-poor blue blood to mix with oxygen-rich pink blood in the left side of the heart and travel to the left ventricle where it is pumped out the aorta and throughout the body. This mixing of the blood will create a slight bluish color in the child, called cyanosis.\nTruncus arteriosus occurs when the blood vessel coming out of the heart in the developing baby fails to separate completely during development, leaving a connection between the aorta and pulmonary artery.

Causes of impaired respiratory effort can be mild and reversible, such as exposure to maternal opioids to severe and non-reversible, such as prolonged hypoxia (UpToDate, 2020). Blockage of the airway can prevent initial breaths. A blockage can be caused by a congenital malformation such as choanal atresia or the presence of meconium or mucus in the airway (UpToDate, 2020). Impaired lung function can cause respiratory distress in a newborn. Some causes of impaired lung function are external causes such as pneumothorax or pleural effusions. Pulmonary hypoplasia can be caused by a diaphragmatic hernia that can impair lung function. Intrinsic lung disease may impact lung function, and some causes are deficient surfactant in a preterm infant or transient tachypnea of the newborn in a full-term infant.\nPersistent pulmonary hypertension is another cause of a complicated transition at birth. In this disorder, the pulmonary vascular resistance remains elevated after birth due to abnormal blood shunting right to left through fetal circulatory pathways. This abnormal shunting can be a life-threatening condition. Severe congenital cardiac disease can cause difficulty for the newborn to transition to extrauterine life. Preterm infants are also more likely to have difficulties transitioning to extrauterine life.\nDifficulty transitioning to extrauterine life is usually correlated to fetal circulation and respiratory issues. There are some other causes of complications that a nurse in the delivery room should be aware. Preterm birth puts the neonate at risk for respiratory problems, hypothermia, hypoglycemia, infection, intracranial hemorrhage, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Most of these complications do not cause immediate problems at delivery (other than respiratory problems), but they are important to be aware. Multiple gestation pregnancies are at increased risk of problems such as preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, discordant growth, and congenital anomalies.

Two stents were required in one child and four in the other in order to stent the entire length of the duct. After the procedures the ducts remained widely patent and arterial oxygen saturations remained above 80%.

This defect may be seen with a single ventricle, which means instead of a left and right ventricle there is just one large ventricle. The survival of an infant with tricuspid atresia is dependent on communication between the right and left atriums via an ASD or atrial septal defect as well as a VSD or ventricular septal defect if there are two ventricles. While the infant is inutero, or before he/she is born, there is a natural connection between the atriums called the PFO or patent foramen ovale. This is a normal structure in fetal circulation. This structure will need to remain patent (open) even after delivery. The surgical intervention required is dependent on the hearts anatomy. The repair is normally complicated and done in stages. The initial surgical procedure, called the BT shunt, is aimed at increasing the pulmonary blood flow. Postoperative hospital stay for the initial procedure averages five to seven days.\n- Pulmonary atresia accounts for less than 1 percent of all CHD. Atresia means blocked. The pulmonary valve is the entrance in the right ventricle to the pulmonary artery. The pulmonary artery carries blood from the right ventricle to the right and left lungs. If there is a VSD (hole in the ventricular septal wall) associated with this defect it is generally considered to be part of the spectrum of Tetralogy of Fallot. However, if this blockage is associated with an intact ventricular septum (no hole or VSD) it may also be referred to as hypoplastic right ventricle. In this scenario the right ventricle and the tricuspid valve are poorly developed. At birth these babies are dependent on the fetal circulation remaining intact. The PFO or patent foramen ovale (which is a normal part of fetal circulation) allows mixing of unoxygenated blood from the right to mix with oxygenated blood on the left. The PDA or patent ductus arteriosus (also a normal fetal structure) also allows for mixing of blood, which provides a means to get blood to the lungs after the baby is born. A baby with a VSD will most likely have a BT shunt procedure.", "score": 1.8763921670453187e-05, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:00009d94-767e-47b1-ac00-6436a7832fa8>", "text": "Most of the children with this condition now a day managed with arterial switch operation (aorta is connected to left ventricle and pulmonary artery to right ventricle) along with correction of associate lesions like closure of ventricular septal defect.\nTetralogy of Fallot\nTetralogy of Fallot is the constellation of four congenital cardiac lesions, including: right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (pulmonary infundibular stenosis), overriding aorta, ventricular septal defect, and right ventricular hypertrophy. There is a resulting variable right-to-left shunt of deoxygenated blood, due to the dynamic right ventricular outflow tract obstruction. Typically, infants present with cyanosis shortly after birth or cyanotic spells “tet spells” with crying, exertion resulting in frequent squatting. Importantly, a variation of Tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia will result in severe cyanosis immediately at birth. Most of the patients are surgically repaired around 4-6 months of age.\nTotal or partial Anomalous Pulmonary Venous Return (TAPVR or PAPVR):\nIn this condition, the pulmonary veins have abnormal connection or drainage into systemic veins resulting in volume overloading of the heart. Infants with TAPVR (all the pulmonary veins) may present with symptoms of heart failure or with severe cyanosis and pulmonary hypertension if obstructed.

Infants present with cyanosis and require surgical treatment.\nEbstein’s anomaly involves the displacement of the septal and posterior leaflets of the tricuspid valve into the right ventricle, resulting in severe tricuspid regurgitation and functional right ventricular hypoplasia.

A lot of times, it starts as an exercise. I start with a tune that I like and I start to change the chords a little bit. I use the same harmonic structure and write a new melody. Once Iíve got the melody, then I change the chords so in the end you have no idea that this new composition started as a known existing tune. An exercises like that serves as a springboard. Sometimes a song can start with a simple groove or something like that.\nFrom LAMPIAO, what tracks stands out for you the most and why?\nMy favorite track on the album is MR. D.P.

He worships at the altar of creativity and has a powerful left hand that supports a right hand which can play extraordinary things—even the most complex melodic lines—making them look so utterly simple. Roberto Magris has a wonderful feel for colour and plays as if from a palette of a myriad of hues. His lines curve in wide arcs cutting through the air; sometimes the arcs bend into ellipses as idioms and metaphors tumble off the keyboard. He is sweetly lyrical on piano as Herb Geller is on his faithful alto saxophone. It is truly unfortunate that most of their performances together were never captured on record, which makes this album, An Evening With Herb Geller & The Roberto Magris Trio – Live in Europe 2009 to die for.\nHerb Geller’s imagination was first fired up by Benny Carter, and later by Charlie Parker. He absorbed these influences while finding his own voice. His breathtaking tone is matched only by his own wondrous sense of colour. Mr. Geller’s take on the lineage of the cool sweetness of the alto saxophone and is less than conventional here, seeing him summoning vocalastics from the instrument which floats benignly over the piano that in its turn adds a rich and not entirely predictable harmonic foundation to the music. The two men appear to carve a cozy niche for themselves as though no one else mattered. What a treat it is to hear Mr. Magris’ soli rippling across the quartet’s tumbling groove. And when it’s Herb Geller’s turn to return the favour his playing is so gracious and full of wonderful surprises. It is hard to imagine anything more delightful to the ear. Mr. Geller can also play with passionate bluesy freedom and you hear this in his composition “Celebrating Bird”. But usually he is more reflective as on Benny Carter’s “Lonely Woman”.

So, let’s start at the beginning, and we can move on from there.\nI was born and raised in the San Fernando Valley of two driven studio musicians, Bob McChesney, and Calabria Foti. They moved to LA in their twenties to pursue careers in their respective instruments – trombone for my Dad, and violin and voice, for my Mom.\nThey have done so well for themselves, been a part of hundreds of timeless records and television shows like the Simpsons, Family Guy, and so many more. Over the years they discovered their joy, ability, and talent of producing their own records of jazz and the Great American Songbook over the years, and even a Grammy Nomination! I come from good stock.\nThey love music, and raised my older sister and I within that passion, requiring that we choose instruments to study from a very early age. My sister stuck to flute, but I bounced around from piano, violin, clarinet, and cello, which I stuck with for nine years. Somewhere along the way, I taught myself how to play guitar and sing, and write songs.\nI started writing songs when I was nine years old, just to process things that were happening in my life, and that became incredibly cathartic for me. I typically wrote songs to figure out how I felt about certain situations, or to resolve or discover something within myself. When I graduated high school, I knew that I wanted to pursue a career in music and entertainment, and be a performer.\nMy parents wanted me to finish college before giving me their blessing to do whatever I wanted afterwards, so I decided to do both. While I was enrolled at CSUN, I wrote and released songs independently, produced and filmed my own music videos, won a couple Indie Music Awards, and performed regularly in Hollywood, even at the Troubadour!\nEven though I was working towards a degree, I never cared about anything more than music, and was always super focused on what came next with my music career. I soon started working with Dean Dinning (Toad the Wet Sprocket) and Mikal Blue (Colbie Callait, Jason Mraz, OneRepublic) at their amazing studio Revolver Recordings in Thousand Oaks, CA, where they helped me hone my writing and studio recording craft.\nI just graduated last December, and now have a college degree in Media Management from CSUN’s Film and Television Department.", "score": 0.800476551, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:7e80af28-f5a5-461b-85d3-c510411b9b4c>", "text": "Duo – Elisabet Raspall & Clara Luna\nElisabet Raspall – piano, voice & composition\nClara Luna – voice, piano & composition\nThe duo formed by the pianists, composers and singers Elisabet Raspall and Clara Luna brings us closer to music as seen from a female perspective.

With this first incursion into the Fado genre, Júlio Resende brings to the scene his innovative proposal of Fado-Jazz: the union of two musical imaginaries which results in a unique creation.According to Resende, the challenge taken on by Amália por Júlio Resende project was \"to bring Fado to the piano (...) All pianists have the dream of making a solo record. I wanted to make the most personal solo record possible. I understand the word \"solo\" as something that has to do with earth, with roots, with the ground you walk on, that you inhabit. Among my earliest musical memories is the voice of Amália singing \"A Casa Portuguesa!\" or the overwhelming \"Estranha Forma de Vida\" and she serves as a symbol for this musical journey.\" The album includes the theme \"Medo\", a virtual and posthumous duet with Amália Rodrigues, using a recording of the singer's voice with unpublished permission from Valentim de Carvalho.\nBetween 2014 and 2016 he undertakes a series of international concerts to present his Amália work. With this album, Resende will visit France, Spain, jumping to Mexico, the United States, until reaching Canada and even Japan.\nIn 2015, Júlio Resende continued his exploration of Fado with the album Fado & Further, debuting the album with a show at the Calouste Gulbenkian Foundation in Lisbon, featuring the singers, Moreno Veloso, Sílvia Pérez Cruz and Gisela João.

She has always given voice to compositions of great composers of the Portuguese song such as Alberto Janes, Frederico de Freitas, Frederico Valério, Jaime Santos, among others.\n1962 was a remarkable year in Amália’s career, she meets the great Portuguese-French composer Alain Oulman. With Oulman, Amália began singing classical poets which to date had never been interpreted in fado before. Her voice combined with the brilliant Oulman’s compositions and the great Portuguese poetry enlarged to the limit of its extension.\nThe beginning of this partnership was a true revolution in the repertoire of Amália and also to fado at the time, giving greater expansion and harmonic richness, representing a turning point for the modern fado. Thus began a close collaboration between Amália and Oulman which was wide in complicity and in time, extending to the end of the composer's life.\nIn 1962 Amália releases the innovative album Asas fechadas (Closed wings) aka Busto (Bust) by Columbia. This album would become one of the greatest classics of fado, despite the strong objections of the purists of the time. With poems of Luís de Macedo, David Mourão-Ferreira, Pedro Homem de Mello and also Amália’s, Oulman writes most of the songs included on the album except Fado Bailado \"Estranha forma de vida\" (Strange way of life) from Alfredo Duarte Marceneiro and Fado Vitória \"Povo que lavas no rio\" (You people who wash in the river) from Joaquim Campos who have achieved great success.\nIn this same session were recorded more 10 songs which resulted in other international releases the following year.", "score": 0.12024402247890358, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:026d322e-2682-4365-8332-3a19597d7caa>", "text": "All the great songs and lyrics from the \"Coimbra \" album ont he Web's largest and most authoritative lyrics resource.

In Florida and the Gulf of Mexico, the species that causes most red tides is Karenia brevis, often abbreviated as K. brevis\nAt high enough concentrations, red tide can discolor water a red or brown hue. Blooms caused by other algal species can appear red, brown, green or even purple. The water can also remain its normal color during a bloom.\nNo, red tides were documented in the southern Gulf of Mexico as far back as the 1700s and along Florida's Gulf coast in the 1840s. Fish kills near Tampa Bay were even mentioned in the records of Spanish explorers.\nRed tides can last as little as a few weeks or longer than a year. They can even subside and then reoccur. The duration of a bloom in nearshore Florida waters depends on physical and biological conditions that influence its growth and persistence, including sunlight, nutrients and salinity, as well as the speed and direction of wind and water currents.\nYes, many algae species cause red tides all over the world. Yet, the organism that causes Florida's red tide, Karenia brevis, is found almost exclusively in the Gulf of Mexico and occurs from Mexico to Florida. K. brevis can be transported around the Gulf of Mexico as coastal waters move with winds and currents. Some red tides have even been carried by the Gulf Stream current into the Atlantic Ocean as far north as Delaware.\nRed tide in Florida can be found in bays and estuaries but not in freshwater systems such as lakes and rivers. Because Karenia brevis cannot tolerate low-salinity waters for very long, blooms usually remain in salty coastal waters and do not penetrate upper reaches of estuaries. However, other harmful algae, including cyanobacteria (blue-green algae), typically bloom in freshwater lakes and rivers.\nAlthough the occurrence of a red tide cannot be predicted, scientists can forecast its movement using wind and water current data once a bloom is located. Scientists also monitor the concentration of the red tide organism by collecting water samples routinely and in response to blooms. Red tide movement and concentration are important because the effects of a red tide, such as dead fish and human respiratory irritation, depend on these factors.", "score": 0.9329141726937101, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:d2edd676-d96b-4e95-a90f-bf5a7c50f6b9>", "text": "In a recent email Simona A. Ceriana, Ph.D, a research scientist from the Marine Turtle Program at FWC, has given us a recent summary about the effects of Red Tide on sea turtle hatchlings.\n“… many of you may wonder whether hatchlings are being impacted by the current Red Tide event. FWC has never documented any apparent adverse effects of red tide on hatchling sea turtles. They are probably not affected because they quickly move offshore, then live at the surface of oceanic areas for at least several years. They likely do not spend much time in any areas with high concentrations of Karenia brevis (red tide) they encounter because they are constantly moving or being moved. Additionally, the primary route of lethal exposure to brevetoxin for sea turtles is through ingestion of food containing brevetoxin. Hatchling sea turtles subsist on internalized yoke for at least a week or so before they begin feeding. By the time they begin feeding, they are well away from nearshore areas where red tide blooms often persist. Hatchlings could be exposed to brevetoxin in aerosols and may experience some irritation to the respiratory tract but, at present, we do not have any indication that this causes mortality or noticeably effects behavior (i. e., no reported unusual number of live or dead wash backs). We will continue to monitor the situation and provide guidance as needed.”\nWell that is welcome news at least for the baby turtles, but what about the adults especially those of reproductive age?\nLoggerhead sea turtles which make up about 99% of the nests in our area, generally nest multiple times in a single nesting season. Then, most skip a year or more before their next nesting season. Many sea turtles migrate huge distances from their foraging areas to the nesting beaches. Mature females will return to the beach that they were born to lay their eggs.\nIn another recent email to our volunteer group in mid August, Allen Foley, the stranding coordinator with FWC gave us the following information about live stranded and dead washed up sea turtles.\n” Indications are that nesting females either do not forage during the inter-nesting interval and during their reproductive migrations or forage very little. At least when they are reproductively active. Females and males are probably not at much risk of accumulating a worrisome amount of brevetoxin since ingestion of brevetoxin in food is how they get lethal exposure.", "score": 0.859472275, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:6fbbd863-a1a3-4c86-b18b-5c405fdbf00e>", "text": "Harmful algal blooms of Karenia brevis, the organism responsible for red tide in the Gulf of Mexico, can impact the health of humans and animal life.

Given the notice from meteorologists that we have entered a new 25- to 50-year cycle of greater hurricane activity and intensity (Landsea et al. 1996), as well as possible longer-term changes associated with global climate change (McCarthy et al. 2001), storm activity may have a greater impact on manatee populations in the future.\nRed Tide: Manatees on Florida’s Gulf coast are frequently exposed to brevetoxin, a potent neurotoxin produced by the dinoflagellate Karenia brevis during red tide events. In 1996, 151 manatees were confirmed or suspected to have died in southwestern Florida from brevetoxicosis (Landsberg and Steidinger 1998, Bossart et al. 1998). This epizootic was particularly detrimental to the manatee population because more adults were killed than any other age class. Other red tide mortality events in 1982, 2002, 2003, and 2005 resulted in the confirmed red tide-related deaths of 37, 33, 86, and 68 manatees, respectively, with an additional 35 carcasses suspected to have died from red tide during those years (O’Shea et al. 1991; FWC unpubl.). Recent studies have determined that brevetoxin can exist outside of the algal cells (e.g., on seagrass) for extended periods of time, thus further increasing the threat to foraging manatees (Flewelling et al. 2005). Red tide represents a major natural source of mortality for manatees in the southwest region. There is no clear evidence that these events have been increasing in frequency along Florida’s coast, but certainly the impact on the manatee population has increased over the past two decades.

Worldwide, hundreds of thousands of sea turtles a year are accidentally caught in shrimp trawl nets, on longline hooks and in fishing gill-nets. Sea turtles need to reach the surface to breathe, and therefore many drown once caught.\nDirect Take: Sea turtles and their eggs are killed by people throughout the world for food, and for products including oil, leather and shell.\nCoastal Development: Sea turtle habitats are degraded and destroyed by coastal development. This includes both shoreline and seafloor alterations, such as nesting beach degradation, seafloor dredging, vessel traffic, construction, and alteration of vegetation.\nClimate change: Climate change will increase the frequency of extreme weather events, result in loss of nesting beaches, and cause other alterations to critical sea turtle habitats and basic oceanographic processes. It may impact natural sex ratios of hatchlings and increase the likelihood of disease outbreaks for sea turtles.\nMarine pollution is anything from a discarded plastic to a lost fishing net. Every ocean in the world is littered with some form of debris which resembles food for marine life. Many animals accidentally eat marine debris causing internal injury, intestinal blockage, and starvation. Once ingested, the plastic piles up in the turtles's stomach and can then obstruct bowels, preventing turtles from digesting food and leading them to starve to death. Light pollution disrupts nesting behavior and causes hatchling death by leading them away from the sea. Chemical pollutants can weaken sea turtles’ immune systems, making them susceptible to disease.\nHabitat loss uncontrolled coastal development, vehicle traffic on beaches, and other human activities have directly destroyed or disturbed sea turtle nesting beaches around the world. Sea turtles are dependent on beaches for nesting. Lights from roads and buildings disorient hatchlings away from the sea, and vehicle traffic on beaches compacts the sand, making it impossible for female turtles to dig nests.

Regional differences continue to be seen in the distribution of HABs in UK and RoI waters with impacts mainly observed in the south and west coast of Ireland and regions in the UK with a strong Atlantic influence, e.g. Regions 1, 3, 4, 6 and 7. There is little monitoring aside from the continuous plankton recorder (CPR) in Region 8. The impacts from HABs in Wales, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man are generally low.\nSince the last MCCIP report card was issued, blooms of Karenia mikimotoi have caused problems in Ayrshire, Scotland, and also in the north-west coast of Ireland where concerns about the quantity of dead wild fish washing on shore during an event in Ireland in 2012 resulted in two beaches being closed to the public.\nNo clear trend that can be attributed to climate change can be observed in the incidence of shellfish toxin producing HABs since the last report card was issued. During the last two years the incidence of some shellfish toxins has continued to decrease (e.g. paralytic shellfish poisoning toxins in Scotland).", "score": 0.847712398, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:81a1ebb5-d3b6-4971-9334-7cb925084cb0>", "text": "Oil spills leave turtles stranded and create massive health problems such has lacerations, starvations and internal organ failure.

The red tide organism in Florida, Karenia brevis, produces brevetoxins that can affect the central nervous system of fish and other vertebrates, causing these animals to die. Wave action can break open K. brevis cells and release these toxins into the air, leading to respiratory irritation. For people with severe or chronic respiratory conditions, such as emphysema or asthma, red tide can cause serious illness. The red tide toxins can also accumulate in molluscan filter-feeders such as oysters and clams, which can lead to Neurotoxic Shellfish Poisoning in people who consume contaminated shellfish.\nRed tides in Florida develop 10-40 miles offshore, away from man-made nutrient sources. In contrast to the many red tide species that are fueled by nutrient pollution associated with urban or agricultural runoff, there is no direct link between nutrient pollution and the frequency or initiation of red tides caused by Karenia brevis. However, once red tides are transported inshore, they are capable of using man-made nutrients for their growth. Red tides occurred in Florida long before human settlement, and severe red tides were observed in the mid-1900s before the state’s coastlines were heavily developed. No single factor causes blooms of K. brevis. Blooms form as a result of the interactions between biology, chemistry, and ocean currents that unite nutrients with light and carry red tide to the beach.\nControl of red tide in Florida is not a simple issue. The harmful effects of a red tide are caused by toxins released by the organism. Potential controls must not only kill the red tide organism but also eliminate the toxins from the water. To date, this has not been possible; however, researchers are identifying ways to reduce shellfish toxicity. In addition, any control strategy must not harm the environment. In the 1950s, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and State of Florida scientists used copper sulfate to attempt to eliminate a red tide in coastal Florida waters. Although the copper sulfate killed some of the red tide cells, it led to the release of toxins that, along with the copper sulfate, had negative effects on other marine organisms.

It makes sense: K. brevis prefers warm waters, so theoretically, global warming and rising ocean temperatures could contribute to the growth in red tides. The fertilizer industry's dumping of nitrogen waste into the ocean could be another potential cause.\nGambierdiscus toxicus, also a marine microorganism, produces neurotoxins that produce symptoms similar to those caused by K. brevis.

Email: firstname.lastname@example.org\nDevelopment of effective management strategies for addressing the occurrence and impacts of harmful algal blooms is dependent upon adequate insight into the mechanisms that control bloom initiation, growth and termination. Dinoflagellates are the major group of microalgae responsible for the production of toxins that impact human and environmental health. Among these, the Florida red tide dinoflagellate, Gymnodinium breve, is among the most notorious. G. breve blooms occur almost annually off the west coast of Florida, where they cause extensive fish kills, marine mammal mortalities, and human illness due to both respiratory irritiation and neurotoxic shellfish poisoning. Blooms of G. breve initiate offshore, and become a threat to coastal ecosystems and humans only when carried inshore by prevailing wind and oceanographic conditions. Once in coastal waters, G. breve cells may experience dramatic changes in environment, resulting in temperature, salinity, pH, light, turbulence, and oxidative stresses.", "score": 0.83876884, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:a07cf7f4-6a82-478b-b325-1f8fd25f53e7>", "text": "RED TIDE FAQs\nWhat is red tide?\nRed tide is a specific type of harmful algal bloom, caused by higher than normal concentrations of microscopic algae. In Florida’s southwest coast and other areas of the Gulf of Mexico, red tide is usually caused by Karenia brevis. K. brevis defends itself from predators by producing brevetoxins that can affect the central nervous system of fish and other vertebrates. This, combined with the algae’s ability to create areas with low oxygen concentrations in the water, can cause many marine animals to die. Brevetoxins can also cause respiratory irritation in humans once airborne.\nWhat causes red tide?\nKarenia brevis causes red tide when their population explodes into a bloom. First, the organism has to have the correct environment. The temperature, salinity of the water and nutrients are all factors that can influence where K. brevis can live. Then K. brevis needs the right physical conditions, like wind or ocean currents, to concentrate and transport to different areas. K. brevisalso needs to surpass other phytoplankton. The presence or absence of other life forms may encourage or inhibit K. brevis blooms. If conditions are correct, K. brevis can reproduce and multiply, causing a red tide.\nHas coastal (nutrient) pollution caused red tide?\nThere is no demonstrated direct link between nutrient pollution and the formation of a Karenia brevis bloom or frequency (how often they occur), according to Mote Marine Laboratory. Florida red tides develop 10-40 miles offshore, away from human-contributed nutrient sources. Red tides have occurred in Florida long before human settlement, and severe red tides were observed in the mid-1900s before the state’s coastlines were heavily developed. However, once red tides are transported to shore, they can use human-contributed nutrients for their growth.\nCan coastal nutrient pollution worsen an existing red tide that has moved close to shore?\nData from Mote has suggested that nutrients that runoff the land into the sea may contribute to red tide. These nutrients can include natural (animal waste) and human-contributed (fertilizer) sources. These sources can runoff in stormwater into storm drains, rivers, and ponds and ultimately the Gulf. These nutrients can serve as “food” for Karenia brevis algae and contribute to red tide blooms once the algae are close to shore.", "score": 0.06700874986967509, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:b5655496-8e4c-4f68-8056-197d1dab9e64>", "text": "NASA Satellites Detect 'Glow' of Plankton in Black Waters\nAlthough just microscopic ocean plants, phytoplankton are the building blocks for the entire marine food chain. And, since they require sunlight, water, and nutrients for growth, they serve as a good indicator of changes in the environment. Sunlight is most abundant at and near the sea surface, so phytoplankton flourish near the top layer of the ocean. Also like plants on land, phytoplankton contain the pigment chlorophyll, which gives them their greenish color. During photosynthesis, chlorophyll in plants use sunlight as an energy source to combine water molecules with carbon dioxide into food.

Sampras was also a calm collected character showing little emotion on the tennis court. One of the biggest rivals in his career was compatriot Andre Agassi and the difference in on court personalities between the two complemented each other well.\nPete Sampras was also a well-rounded player with few weaknesses in his game. He adopted an unorthodox smash known as the “Slam Dunk” which became his trade mark. The overhead smash was played whilst airborne which is a shot no player has really emulated since. Sampras officially retired in 2003 when he was at the top of his game. He still makes appearances at various charity events today.\nIt seems a bit of a theme here that some of the biggest names in tennis are quiet and reserved people.

I've discussed the notion that Sampras played with a semiwestern grip on the forehand side. Stan Smith (ex champion) discussed this in articles he did recently. However, most people here say that Sampras played with an eastern grip. The reason I believe Pete used a semi western: He played with an open stance like everyone today He had excellent shoulder rotation on his shots He had an excellent inside out forehand He had an excellent down the line forehand He had ax excellent return of serve forehand on both courts where an open stance and quick motion is vital He had a long loopy swing when rallying He had high net clearance on his forehands and they would land deep into his opponents court - this is vital as it meant he didn't hit too many short balls where he could be attacked. It also means he put more topsin on his shots than people realise. So, with all this in mind what I want to ask is, can these shots be performed today with an eastern grip? If they are, do any other players play today with an eastern grip on the forehand?", "score": 0.828080058, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:0012daa8-07f3-4dbf-b9b5-65780c11f81e>", "text": "Roger Federer’s frequent night play on Rod Laver Arena sparked some controversy at this year’s Australian Open.\nI will start with 1991 because I recall the write-up of Jimmy Connors 1991 US Open run mentioning him asking for and receiving extra night matches.\nCould Connors have run like this during the day and recovered as quickly?\n1991 US Open – Jimmy Connors received extra night matches and main court matches despite needing a wild card to play the US Open.

Brad Gilbert and especially Darren Cahill are two of ESPN’s better analysts, but they both coached Andre Agassi in the past. Gilbert briefly coached Andy Murray as well before parting from the Scot. They really couldn’t devote all of their time to commentary. Now that they’re less centrally involved in coaching (though certainly not removed from it entirely), they can comment on matches. Paul Annacone was front and center as a coach when he guided both Pete Sampras and Roger Federer. After the end of his partnership with Federer, he has been able to join Tennis Channel’s “Center Court” program, providing commentary on various weekend matches that are covered in whip-around fashion from TC’s studios.\nAmerican tennis broadcasters have increased the number of analysts they bring to the majors. Not all of these analysts are exceptionally good, but some are. Tennis has come a long way from the 1980s, when the size of a stable of commentators at a major tournament (play-by-play and analysis) was much smaller than it is today. You might hear several voices you don’t like, but a larger group of commentators means it’s more likely you’ll enjoy a few as well — that’s progress.\n2 – TENNIS CHANNEL\nThe network dedicated solely to the coverage of tennis has been around for only seven years, and for the first few years, it did not possess enough resources to offer live coverage of various tournaments from start to finish. Even now, the network has to pick its spots a little bit; acquiring live feeds for tournaments played outside North America costs money. Tennis Channel wasn’t able to cover as many tournaments during the weeks when multiple tournaments took place. When it did cover tournaments, broadcasts wouldn’t start until Thursday (the round of 16 at any tournament that ends on a Sunday).

There wasn't much reaction to these moves, but the latest action has drawn widespread attention.\nThe WIPTC made a third rule change for Capriati's sake last month.

However, I’d have no problem if Agassi was seeded 6th in 1996 and they put him on Louis Armstrong while Kafelnikov was seeded 4th and put on the grandstand if they were playing simultaneously.\nConnors helped to build the US Open over the years. Did he deserve some consideration in 1991 or was that stacking the deck? If TV revenue and ticket sales pay the prize money, I think giving Connors time on the biggest court at the best TV times made good sense. It helped Connors sure, but his 1991 run also helped tennis in general.\nSimilarly, I think it would have been crazy to put Sampras-Agassi 2001 on during the day when most US citizens would be working and missing the broadcast. I think Agassi had earned the right to some consideration at the 2005 US Open in the same manner that Connors had earned it in 1991. Federer in 2018 also earned some consideration.\nA tennis court in spite of the number of seats around it has the same dimensions as any other court. If more eyeballs and tickets sold helps the ITF or ATP or WTA’s players, then popularizing the sport is rarely the wrong call.

It was a remarkable run of elite players, one that perhaps reached its apex in 2002, when Sampras and Agassi met in the Open final in New York.\nSampras repeatedly warned American tennis fans that the run would not last forever, that tennis had grown global, that expectations were too high.\n''Obviously, we were spoiled,'' the American player Michael Russell said Tuesday after losing to Querrey here.\nSome, like Justin Gimelstob and Darren Cahill, two retired players turned commentators, argue that American men's tennis is healthier and stronger than it was two or three years ago. Gimelstob noted that American players have won nine singles titles this season, second only to Spanish players, who have won 16.\nIsner, ranked No. 19, and Querrey, ranked No. 21, have become forces on the men's tour, contenders at most tournaments.

Let’s Answer that with Science.\nMany sports drink companies claim to offer the nutrition athletes need to perform well. We examine what athletes need and what sports drinks deliver.\n“Performance is about fuel. Longevity is all about recovery.” — Jack LaLanne\nAthletes want to know: what is the best drink for getting the nutrition that’s recommended before, during, and after exercise? Dr. Robert Silverman reviewed the literature to find out what is needed in a sports drink and what nutrition the popular brands have in it.\nAn extensive review of various literature shows that the “best” sports drink should contain carbohydrates, electrolytes, and numerous other ingredients. Sports drinks should not only fuel activity, but also aid in recovery. Let’s review the key components of an efficient sports drink and how some of the popular brands stack up.\nCarbs are a key component of nutrition for athletic performance, recovery, and health. Generally, 30-60 grams of carbs per hour is recommended for an athletic endeavor. In addition, this amount enables athletes to maintain blood glucose levels. It also reduces dehydration, a critical concern for athletic performance.\nSports drinks should contain electrolytes such as sodium, potassium, magnesium and chloride. Magnesium, a key electrolyte, plays a pivotal role in 300 enzymatic reactions. Bisglycinate has been shown to be the best form of magnesium because it is chelated (bonded) to an amino acid (glycine). Magnesium in the form of bisglycinate ensures increased intestinal absorption of nutrition and prevents diarrhea.\nMalic acid is a critical addition to a sports drink formulation. It reduces muscle tenderness and assists with soft-tissue recovery.\nTaurine is an amino acid that helps regulate the level of water and mineral salts in the blood by keeping potassium and magnesium inside the cell.\nL-carnosine, also an amino acid, helps fight muscle fatigue in fast-twitch fibers and aids in athletic performance.\nIn addition, a full range of complex B vitamins for energy production should be included in the drink as well to address a full range of nutrition needs.\nWhat Are Most of the Popular Sports Drinks Missing?\nOf the more popular brands, Powerade contains high-fructose corn syrup as a source of carbohydrates; it lacks electrolytes and any recovery ingredients. Gatorade has no vitamins and contains only sodium and potassium.", "score": 0.841964, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:e88c479c-fa51-4281-9a51-ba2ebf4a5f84>", "text": "They contain stimulants like caffeine and guarana and a fairly high amount of sugars.\nWhile artificial energy drinks can lead to headaches, anxiety, and heart issues, natural homemade energy drinks are a great option to restore hydration, balance mood levels, and pump up the lost energy.\nChildren and teens are generally advised not to consume an excess of energy drinks in order to avoid the dangerous side effects they have. But they can consume natural substitutes to recover their body functions.\nElectrolyte drinks, on the other hand, are flavored beverages that often contain carbohydrates, minerals and electrolytes, and sometimes other vitamins and nutrients. They are generally consumed by sportspeople in endurance activity for rehydration purposes.\nElectrolyte drinks are also artificially produced and sold but they are not recommended for general consumption or as a substitute for water due to their high-calorie content.\nBut just as we have healthier choices for everything, natural electrolyte drinks like coconut water, milk, electrolyte infused water, smoothies, etc. turn out to be a great source of electrolyte and fluid replenishment with no harm.\nEnergy drinks can be a great fit for energy and hydration if one knows the moderation and ways to consume them.

Research has found that fat-free chocolate milk will beat out carbohydrate sports drinks at helping to rebuild and refuel muscles after exercise. “It’s not just a dessert item, but it’s very healthy, especially for endurance athletes.” (William Lunn, PhD, an exercise scientist at the University of Connecticut).\nThe combination of carbohydrates and protein in low-fat chocolate milk appears to be “just right” for refuelling weary muscles. Additionally, drinking fat-free chocolate milk led to a higher concentration of glycogen, or muscle fuel, in muscles 30 and 60 minutes after exercise, compared with the sports drink. Replenishing glycogen after exercise helps future performance, Lunn says.\nSo next time you reach for a bright coloured sports drink for replenishment after your workout, consider drinking up some chocolate milk.

The combination of carbs and protein already in chocolate milk matched the ratio found to be most beneficial for recovery. In fact, studies suggest that chocolate milk has the right mix of carbs and protein to help refuel exhausted muscles, and the protein in milk helps build lean muscle. This new research adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting milk can be just as effective as some commercial sports drinks in helping athletes refuel and recover.\nMilk also provides fluids for rehydration and electrolytes, including potassium, calcium and magnesium lost in sweat, that both recreational exercisers and elite athletes need to replace after strenuous activity.

She was replaced with an artistic rendering of Brad Paisley.\nThe artist adds that his new design features a \"stained glass\" aesthetic, representing Swift's pop leanings, as well as her country roots. According to a mock-up provided by Davis, the mural will also feature a guitar in the background, as well as an oversized blue butterfly and glittery matching jewel.\nWell before he got to work on the mural, Davis established a GoFundMe page dedicated to making the Swift-centric art piece happen. He's been vocal about his desire to keep a place for the megastar in Music City, despite painting her out of the all-star downtown mural: After all, Swift broke down barriers, set records and cleared major milestones during her time as a country artist, even winning the Country Music Association's coveted Entertainer of the Year trophy twice (in 2009 and 2011) and becoming the first woman to ever win prestigious Pinnacle Awards at the 2013 CMA Awards ceremony.\nBut with Swift transitioning out of the genre in favor of a broader musical focus, it's debatable whether she still belongs on a mural honoring the genre's legacy, with artists like Loretta Lynn, Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash also depicted in the all-star spread. When he began the mural's overhaul late in 2020, Davis clarified that it was the bar owner's decision — not his — to remove Swift's image from the picture, adding that some country fans disapproved of her inclusion, according to USA Today.\n\"I have heard many complaints here in Nashville about Taylor being on the wall with country legends since she is currently focused mainly on pop,\" he reasoned. \"Some inebriated bar hoppers have spit on her image specifically, feeling betrayed by her venture from country.

I don’t know, but the fifth anniversary of the blog seems a good time to finally get it done. (I waited to write about the Musica statue for the fourth anniversary.)\nBut before talking about the anniversary, let’s talk about the mural. This is more than a mural, it’s an icon and it’s something of an industry. Just check out the IBelieveInNasvhille.com website, the I Believe in Nashville Facebook page, and the I Believe in Nashville Instagram page. It was created by Adrien Saporiti back in 2012. While there are older ones, this makes it older than all but maybe a handful of the murals in Nashville. It has spawned copies, some by Saporiti, some not, and imitators. You can get it on shirts, cups, and practically anything you want.\nAlthough clearly beloved, as you can see by perusing the #ibelieveinNashville hashtag on Instagram, it has also weathered some tough times. It has been vandalized on three occasions. In March of 2017, someone splashed black tar on it, and the following June, the circle was painted over with a globe, and “Nashville” was replaced with “Global Warming.” And in August 2018, the word “Nashville” was replaced with the word “rack” in a graffiti style. Its iconic status no doubt attracted all this damage. Saporiti has returned each time to repair it.\nI chose a wide shot to include all the tags and signatures on the mural. When Saporiti first painted the mural, the business home of his art was DCXV Industries (DCXV means 615, Nashville’s area code), and that’s how the mural was originally signed. Since then, Saporiti has stopped using the DCXV brand. It now carries tags for the “I Believe in Nashville” internet destinations, as well as tags for Howells Alley, a reference to the developers who own the buildings alongside the alley.", "score": 0.819703937, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:b6591f07-2f13-4d85-b277-52667119acb1>", "text": "Which cities across the globe do you consider to be the best for creative murals?", "score": 0.819510758, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:e6b2ba18-abf5-4dff-b958-1c6c0b735b68>", "text": "Music Rising is a campaign that was launched in 2005 as a post-Katrina effort to rescue and preserve the musical culture of the Central Gulf region of the United States by replacing the musical instruments lost or destroyed in the deluge.

When I started blogging about outdoor art in Nashville, I never thought either the blog or the art scene would become much of a big deal. Well, the blog is still a fairly minor affair, with about four to five thousand page views a month. I have to say I’m a little embarrassed about some of the early work, but back then I didn’t really know what I was doing. I’ve since learned a lot, and now I think I’ve created something unique. I don’t think there are a lot of blogs like mine, with now 740 articles devoted to outdoor art in a particular town. I have to say in the latter days (hopefully!) of the pandemic I’ve slowed down my posting some, mostly because I’ve been homebound. I hope those days are passed.\nAs for the scene itself, it as of course exploded. That’s been part of the luck of this blog. I started right when things were starting to take off. Now art is everywhere, and who can possibly keep up? Two trends are very clear. One, art is strongly driven by tourism. It is increasingly seen as part of the price of doing business, and it drives foot traffic (and all those lovely selfies with the location tagged). Another smaller trend that piggybacks off the first is that national chains are getting into the act. While still primarily something local businesses do, I knew when Kroger got in the game, the rules had changed. Others have since followed.\nHere’s where I make a point I make in all these anniversary posts: all of those images of fruit, meat, vegetables, and scenes of the old country found on immigrant businesses? It’s real art done by real artists, just as much as the famous wings are. Check out Ruben Dario and José Fernando Vargas on the Artists page.\nThe most moving things that have ever happened with this blog have also been the most tragic. Because of all the research and writing I had done, I was able to document the damage done by the March 3, 2020 tornado to outdoor art in Nashville in the posts “What We Lost in the Storm” and “Storm Damage, Germantown and North Nashville.” Those posts are some of the most widely read of any on this blog.", "score": 0.811738908, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:d52d3971-d72b-4e03-8098-bd3b7a42d5ac>", "text": "At the recent dedication of the magnificent mural that wraps completely around the AT&T building on MLK Boulevard and the presentation by muralist Meg Saligman that followed, I took my seat, eager to hear how she and a small group of local artists created this monumental mural. As I sat down, I kept thinking that the man sitting next to me seemed oddly familiar.\nThe mural, \"The M.L. King Mural: We Will Not be Satisfied Until,\" is the largest mural in the Southeastern U.S. and one of the top five largest murals in the county, covering 42,000 square feet. I enjoyed watching the mural progress from a computer-generated grid on the bare walls, to a numbered chalk drawing, to painted backgrounds and then finally to elaborate portraits and scenery. This drab building slowly changed into a brilliant icon for the city of Chattanooga, telling the stories of the people and places in our community.\nImages in the mural are inspired by Dr. Martin Luther King’s \"I Have a Dream Speech,\" and real stories of people and places of Chattanooga depict the past, present and future vision for Chattanooga.\nEach side of the building offers its own theme; for example, the MLK Boulevard wall imagines present day Chattanooga as it looks toward the future, while the Houston Street wall represents transformation in Chattanooga, past and future. Looking closely, you can see the Tennessee River, a nighttime scene of Chattanooga, images of Lookout Mountain, the Chattanooga landscape, the changing direction of MLK Boulevard and Bessie Smith dancing, just to name a few.\nThe people painted in the mural are real present day Chattanooga people selected by the artists. This gets me back to why the man sitting next to me seemed so familiar. His name is Cleon Coleman, a local business man, and I recognized him because he is the man the artists painted in the mural to represent \"looking out … standing tall and proud.\"\nThe mural is awesome!

Some artists worked long hours to finish their work for the event. Walt Strickland, photographer, made three-dimensional pictures that are held together by handmade frames which he crafts by hand. “I had a piece sitting on my desk at home that I spent a total of 80 hours working on and I finally took a knife to it and trashed it,” said Walt Stricklin. “I absolutely love this event. The people that come here are relaxed and everyone has a great time.” Many paintings were hung from the eave of the tents in an organized chaos of color, including Sarah Scott’s water-color paintings. The bright, vivid colors blend with images of people, creatures, nature and other different living animals. “My inspiration for a lot of my art is life” said Sarah Scott, artist. “Many people who view my paintings immediately can tell what inspires my work.”\nThe notion of buying and owning original art within society is often reserved within the confines of prestige and elitism, reserving its ownership and viewership for those wealthy enough to pay the price of museum and gallery tickets. In 2006, a social movement was started by English artist “My Dog Sighs,” in hopes of expanding the accessibility of art by bringing it into the streets for open consumption. Free Art Friday, a local art movement turned global, encourages artists of all means to leave their art in public places for citizens to pick up and take home with them. The project brings together local artists that contribute free art which is scattered throughout public places in the city. Since its public initiation 12 years ago, Free Art Fridays have popped up in hundreds of cities around the world.

So far, Peet has created more than 16 larger-than-life paintings of at-risk animals and plants indigenous to communities across the United States, often collaborating with local artists.

The southeastern United States is a hotspot for freshwater biodiversity, and a few springs in and around Birmingham offer the last sanctuaries for the watercress darter, a tiny fish listed as endangered since 1970. Peet joined forces with the bookstore proprietor, local college faculty and two Alabama artists to create a 30-foot-long portrait of the brightly colored darter. To boost the species’ chances for survival, a team began restoration work at Roebuck Springs—a darter stronghold inside a city park near the mural site—in March 2018, removing asphalt and installing native plants to control runoff and improve water quality. “If a mural can get people to identify with where they live and with the creatures that share their space,” Peet says, “then the project is a success.”\nSense of place rings through the compositions of Conner Youngblood, a musician based in Nashville, Tennessee.", "score": 0.06661817209485016, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:dad5fa0a-bbdb-4d24-943f-3a8348a9e7cb>", "text": "Projects like Women Paint and Girls Mural Camp take up space in the public sphere and help facilitate discussions about important issues that affect our overlapping communities such as misogyny, transphobia, homophobia, white supremacy, colonization and gentrification.\nExplore the completed murals below and learn more about the project and artists via\nAbout the Riverside Laneway Art Project: Women Paint Riverside\nAs part of the Riverside BIA’s Streetscape Master Plan published in 2019, the laneway north of Queen Street East between Carroll Street and Broadview was the first core area identified for a quick start implementation as a Laneway Art Program in partnership with local property owners.

Having something like this to hand-out, along with business cards and photos of your work, is very helpful to have when asking property owners if you can paint a mural on their wall.\nBENEFITS OF MURALS\n- Murals discourage tagging and vandalism\n- Having a mural will save you money over time… less tagging = less buffing\n- A protective clear coat can be applied to the mural; limiting fading and making the removal of any future tagging much easier\n- Murals call attention to your business\n- Murals can be used to promote your products or services\n- Murals improve the quality of public space for everyone to enjoy\n- Murals create a unique sense of place and community identity\n- Murals can showcase Portland’s local artistic talent\n- Murals help support the local economy, especially if the muralist is a local artist\n- Murals foster neighborhood pride, build neighborhood identity, and are respected by neighbors who often become unofficial stewards and protector\n- Neighborhood murals are good for local businesses. A 2008 study looked at 265 commercial corridors in Philadelphia and found that business sales increased with the addition of murals in neighborhoods.\nHOW TO PAINT A MURAL IN PORTLAND\nIN PORTLAND, GETTING OWNER PERMISSION IS NOT ENOUGH.

(We'll talk more about this truly amazing tooth in another section.)\nIf you wanted to take your new pal out to lunch, HowStuffWorks recommends the fish you can find in cold waters -- cod, salmon, herring and halibut. Narwhals also like a good shrimp or squid feast. But if you're trying to make a reservation, you're out of luck -- no one is sure just how many narwhals there are. In parts of Baffin Bay, where narwhals are most populous, the number has been recorded at 34,000 [source: Culik]. And you won't be able to tell if the narwhals really enjoyed your company -- like dolphins, they have permasmiles.\nWe're still in the getting-to-know-you phase with narwhals. How old do they get? One study on narwhal eyes put the oldest subject at 115 years [source: Garde et al.]. Is that unusual? We don't know. Why do they have that tusk? We're not positive, but we have some ideas. Why do they dive so deeply? Let's take a look at narwhal behavior.\nNarwhals, like other toothed whales, have big brains in relation to their body size. In fact, the size of an odontocete's brain is second only to yours [source: National Science Foundation]. Toothed whales such as the narwhal display humanlike behavior we associate only with apes, like recognizing themselves in the mirror and understanding abstract ideas [source: National Science Foundation]. The narwhal is one smart cookie.\nInterestingly, the first big jump in whale brain size seems to have happened when cetaceans first started using echolocation, the ability to locate objects with sound. The narwhal swims through deep waters in search of its prey, and as you might imagine, it's a bit murky down there. Bats, who hunt at night, use echolocation to find their prey, too.\nFirst, the whale has to produce a sound. Toothed whales don't have anything exactly like our vocal cords, although they have similar structures.", "score": 0.9925331000342447, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:deafac80-9ae7-4674-9963-740f86ede8de>", "text": "It's thought that they produce their sounds in their nasal passages [source: Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust]. The melon, the fatty structure we mentioned before, then focuses these sounds into a beam before sending them out. The sound waves then travel until they hit something, at which point the echoes bounce back to the whale. The whale receives these echoes either in the lower jaw or directly in the skull, depending on the frequency of the sound [source: Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust]. Each species has a different range of frequencies, depending on what they need echolocation for -- low-frequency sounds go farther, while high-frequency sounds are suited to short distances. From the echoes, the whales can determine where their food is, among other things.\nOdontocetes don't make whale songs -- you've probably heard a dolphin's clicks and whistles before. Narwhals whistle and produce a combined pulsed/tonal sound [source: ScienceDaily]. Researchers think the narwhals use echolocation to communicate as well as hunt.\nThe diving patterns of narwhals aren't completely understood. They're recognized as one of the deepest-diving cetaceans, descending more than a mile (1.6 km) into the ocean, but a mile isn't the norm. A study recorded one narwhal making regular deep dives, with long breaks at the surface, while the other subject made lots of shallow dives with less time at the surface [source: Laidre]. The same study, conducted in Tremblay Sound and Creswell Bay, reported a dive pattern: a steep descent with a short stop at the bottom, then a slower ascent to the surface [source: Laidre]. But diving behavior depends on what time of year it is and therefore the whale's location due to migration -- during the winter in a place like Baffin Bay, the narwhals dive deeper and longer in search of polar cod and other fish that don't like to hang out near the surface. In the summer when narwhals migrate to a more hospitable clime, it's not necessary to go so deep.\nAnd now let's look at the narwhal's distinguishing feature: its tusk.\nThe Narwhal Tusk\nContemplate your own teeth for a second.

In fact, when you’re snorkeling, fish can sometimes follow you around and stare at you the entire time. Whenever this happens to you, we highly suggest you to grab your camera. More information and tips can be found in our article about snorkeling with a GoPro.\nThey’re not sure what you are and don’t recognize you as a human being, but they know you are something different than what they’re used to. When this happens, consider yourself lucky. It means the fish don’t take you as a predator.\nFish in aquariums stare because, believe it or not, they do start to recognize their owners after a while. Fish feel emotions, and even though they aren’t the same type of emotions that humans feel, they are emotions nonetheless. Even though you and your fish live in completely different habitats, fish will memorize their surroundings and your face, and they like looking at it.\n15. Can Fish See In The Dark?\nWhile fish can technically see in the dark, their vision is completely different than a human’s. Most fish have a lateral line that runs down their side and contains neuromasts. These neuromasts help the fish determine what’s around them, which helps them see underwater.\nWhen fish are trying to find their prey, they use electric fields. For example, elephant fish use low-current electricity to determine how far away an object is. Zoologists have determined that fish can actually use these electric fields to create three-dimensional images of any item nearby.\nDeep-sea fish usually have some color vision and can even see ultraviolet light. In addition, many fish (including fangtooth, viperfish, bristlemouths, and barracudina) rely on their inner ear to “see” what’s going on around them. They can detect water-pressure changes and use their sense of smell to navigate deep dark water. That’s how they “see” their pray.\nIn addition, some fish have eyes that are adapted to low-light situations. They’re able to see just fine in deep dark water. The so called “flashlight fish” are able to produce low amounts of light by themselves, which allows them to see their prey.\nWhen it comes to pet fish, like betta fish and goldfish, visions vary.", "score": 0.840859592, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:31c70708-e35b-4253-a45c-12cf9fc9562e>", "text": "How do they find food when they’re wandering around in the dark?

In fact, a large portion of their brain is devoted to detecting odors.\n7. … WHICH MIGHT EXPLAIN WHY THEY’RE THIEVES.\nCoconut crabs are also known as robber crabs because they snatch silverware and other objects and carry them away. Some people have even advanced the gruesome theory that Amelia Earhart’s remains are missing because coconut crabs hauled them down into their burrows. The thievery might be tied to that incredible sense of smell. Coconut crabs ignore objects that have been washed clean of scents, suggesting that they may only abscond with things that carry a faint whiff of food.\n8. THEY'RE PRETTY ANTISOCIAL.\nBut that’s not the end of their antisocial behavior. When coconut crabs emerge to feed, they keep their distance from each other. To maintain their personal space, they’ll announce their presence with ritualized claw waving. Laidre sought to find out if coconut crabs ever gathered together to interact (beyond mating or eating each other). The scientist tethered coconut crabs to one spot and watched to see if any others came to visit. They did not.\n9. THEY CARRY THEIR DEVELOPING YOUNG UNDER THEIR ABDOMENS.\nAfter coconut crabs mate, females attach their eggs to special appendages and carry them under their abdomens. While the young develop inside the eggs, the females hold onto them, sticking near the edge of the sea so that they can periodically moisten the eggs.\nBut this care ends when the young are ready to hatch. The females release their hatchlings into the ocean waves. Now the tiny, floating babies must fend for themselves—and only a few will survive to return to land.\n10. WE NEED TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THEM.\nCoconut crabs are little-studied creatures, and we need to know more about them—not just because they’re incredible and have a lot to tell us about biology, but also because we want to keep them around.\nThey may be huge and heavily armored, but they can be vulnerable.", "score": 0.839805067, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:be54089d-13dc-481f-aaea-8c77cffd41bf>", "text": "Blindfolded dolphins can detect a object three inches in diameter from a distance of a 120 meters.\nDolphins rely on echolocation more than sight to sense objects. Not only can they deduce the presence of an object with echolocation they can deduce its size and what it is. They can also determine if a container is full or empty and distinguish between a rock and a piece of flesh. Studies have shown that dolphins are almost as good at picking out objects of different shapes and sizes when they blindfolded as when they are not blindfolded.\nRiver Dolphin Sonar and Communication\nRiver dolphins are nearly blind. They have very small eyes. Indus and Ganges dolphins even lack lenses and can do little more than distinguish light and dark and night and day. The water they swim in is often so muddy that even if the could see they could only see a few inches in front of them. River dolphins rely on echolocation more than vision to locate their prey. In the sea, dolphins use their echolocation primarily to locate and catch fish. River dolphins use it primarily to navigate through the murky water so they can sweep for fish. They swim on their sides and sweep their long bony snouts in wide arcs across the river bottom, emitting long trains of echolocation clicks that let them hunt fish in all but opaque waters.\"\nDavid Attenborough wrote: “The Ganges dolphin lives in waters that are so cloudy and thick with suspended mud that no one swimming in it, animal or human, could see more than a few inches ahead. The dolphin certainly cannot. For it is blind. Its eyes are tiny and do not even have lenses within them.

These sounds are very high-pitched and, like those produced by bats, have important components that are far beyond the range of the human ear. They are produced in passages within the skull and then focused, amplified and transmitted forward by a large lump of fat in the dolphin’s forehead, known as the melon.

Well, most of them use something called their lateral line – a row of hair cells down either side of their body that detect changes in water pressure caused by movement, or by water flowing around objects. Now, scientists from Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University and MIT have copied the lateral lines of the blind cave fish, in a man-made system designed to allow autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to navigate more accurately and efficiently.\nOrdinarily, AUVs use cameras, sonar, or an underwater acoustic positioning system. Cameras aren’t much use in murky water, however – and a lot of the world’s water bodies are murky. Sonar and acoustics are better in such situations, but the hardware can be expensive, and taxing on the AUV’s batteries.\nBy contrast, the blind cave fish-inspired sensors can reportedly be made for under US$100 per array, and use little power. Additionally, they don’t produce audible sonar “pings” that can be harmful to aquatic animals.\nInstead, the system utilizes an array consisting of two rows of five sensors (yes, we know there are four rows in the picture – it's presumably two joined arrays). Each sensor measures just 1.8 x 1.8 mm and consists of a microscopic sensory pillar surrounded by hydrogel, that bends with changes in the water pressure. Combined with a computer vision system, the arrays reportedly allow Nanyang’s AUVs to create 3D images of nearby objects, and to map their surroundings.\nBesides their use in AUVs it has also been suggested that the sensors could find use on military submarines, that don’t wish to announce their presence to enemies via sonar pings.\nThe scientists have already created two versions of the sensor array. One is a piezoelectric version that generates its own voltage via the flow of the water over the sensors, while the other is a piezo-resistive version that can detect submerged objects even when the water flowing around them is barely moving.\nAnother lateral line-inspired underwater sensing system is being developed by scientists from the University of Illinois and Northwestern University.\nSource: Nanyang Technological University\nSee the stories that matter in your inbox every morning", "score": 0.838900447, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:f9047d71-90c6-4527-9553-33a2788565ec>", "text": "Narwhal’s have been called some of the world’s strangest animals, with their unicorn-like tusks that can reach over 8 feet long.

This represents the pressure component of sound. At the same time, there is also back and forth motion of the particles making up the medium (particle motion). Animals can detect these different aspects of sound.\nAlthough marine invertebrates do not hear in the same way vertebrates do, it is thought they are able to sense vibrations and movements associated with sound production. Some marine invertebrates that produce sound in air have specialized sensory organs that can detect acoustic pressure changes in air. However, marine invertebrates in water are known to detect only particle motion. External sensory hairs and internal statocysts aid marine invertebrates in sound detection.\nMost marine crustaceans (e.g. lobster, crabs, and shrimp) have an extensive array of sensory hairs covering their bodies. Water- or substrate-borne vibrations associated with changes in acceleration, hydrodynamic flow, and/or sound, may stimulate these sensory hairs. Detecting these vibrations may help animals sense the movements of other nearby organisms. Researchers found sensory hairs located on the claws of the to be most sensitive to water vibration frequencies between 150-300Hz.

Auditory Evoked Potential (AEP) studies (with electrodes placed near the statocysts) showed responded to sounds between 30 and 500 Hz. The animals were most sensitive at frequencies between 100 and 300 Hz. Auditory brainstem response (ABR) studies found and to be sensitive to sounds from 400-1500 Hz and 400-1000 Hz, respectively.

What is a narwhal tusk?\nThe narwhal tusk—most commonly found on males—is actually an enlarged tooth with sensory capability and up to 10 million nerve endings inside. Some narwhals have up to two tusks, while others have none. The spiraled tusk juts from the head and can grow as long at 10 feet.\n2. Where do narwhals live?\nUnlike some whale species that migrate, narwhals spend their lives in the Arctic waters of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Russia. Most narwhals winter for up to five months under sea ice in the Baffin Bay-Davis Strait area.\n3. What threats do narwhals face?\nOil and gas development and climate change pose threats to narwhals. Increased development means more shipping vessels, creating more opportunities for collisions and more underwater noise that can interfere with communication among the whales. WWF helps raise awareness of and address the threat of noise pollution on narwhals and other whales. The Don’t Be a Buckethead initiative delves further into this topic.\n4. What do narwhals eat?\nNarwhals feed on Greenland halibut, Arctic and polar cod, squid and shrimp. They do their chomping at the ice floe edge and in the ice-free summer waters.\n5. How deep do narwhals dive?\nNarwhals can dive a mile-and-a-half deep in the ocean. Cracks in the sea ice above allow them to pop up for air when they need it.\n6. What color are narwhals?\nNarwhals change color as they age. Newborns are a blue-gray, juveniles are blue-black and adults are a mottled gray. Old narwhals are nearly all white.\n7. How do we learn more about narwhals?\nWWF learns more about the movements of narwhals through satellite tracking. We document the paths of narwhals during their annual feeding and reproductive routines to better understand the species.\nThreats To Narhal's\nIn addition, the narwhal’s habitat is threatened by the effects of climate change and pollution.

But Frank Bainimarama told delegates here that whether you lived in Miami or New York, you wouldn't be able to escape the rising seas. Fiji will lead the next key UN climate talks later this year. This normally low-profile May meeting of UN delegates has been overshadowed to an extent by the ongoing question of future US involvement in the Paris accord. While not addressing Mr Trump or the US directly, Mr Bainimarama told the negotiators that he would bring his own experience as a Pacific islander to his role as head of the Conference of Parties. We who are most vulnerable must be heard, whether we come from the Pacific or other Small Island Developing States, other low-lying nations and states or threatened cities in the developed world like Miami, New York, Venice or Rotterdam,\" he told negotiators. \"But together we must speak out for the whole world - every global citizen - because no-one, no matter who they are or where they live, will ultimately escape the impact of climate change.\" Other members of the Fijian team hoped that the US would be able to stay in the climate \"family\", but that progress would be made with or without the Americans.\n5-18-17 Narwhals could help us measure melting glaciers underwater\nNarwhals could help us measure melting glaciers underwater\nA project off Greenland will tag whales with sensors to measure sea temperatures and ice melt in hard-to-reach places, improving predictions of sea-level rise.

When it comes to marine mammals, dolphins have cornered the market on cuteness. Their faces seem to possess a knowing smile that never fades away. The way they glide through the water and sail through the air is nothing short of magical.\nBut did you know that dolphins also possess a unique ability to see with sound that still amazes and mystifies scientists to this very day? It's true! It's called echolocation, and dolphins share the use of this unique way of “seeing\" the world with other animals, such as whales, porpoises, and bats.\nWhy would dolphins need to use sound to see, though? Think about the times you've gone swimming. How well do you see underwater? With goggles, you might be able to see several yards in very clear water. However, in murky water, your visibility might be mere feet or even inches. The same holds true for dolphins.\nDolphins have developed the ability to use echolocation, often known as sonar, to help them see better underwater. Scientists believe this ability probably evolved slowly over time. Echolocation allows dolphins to “see\" by interpreting the echoes of sound waves that bounce off of objects near them in the water.\nTo echolocate objects nearby, dolphins produce high-frequency clicks. These clicks create sound waves that travel quickly through the water around them. In fact, sound waves travel almost five times faster through water than they do through air.\nWhen the sound waves bounce off of objects, they return to the dolphins as echoes. Dolphins pick up those echoes with their lower jaw and their enormous foreheads. These areas have cavities filled with fatty tissues that channel the sounds toward the ears and then on to the brain, where they're interpreted.\nSo exactly what can dolphins “see\" via these echoes? A lot! Using a combination of regular sight and echolocation, dolphins are able to determine the shape, speed, distance, size, direction of travel, and even some basic facts about the internal structure of objects in the water around them. This information is critical for dolphins to find food and navigate in dark or murky waters.\nEcholocation was first studied in depth by famous marine explorer and scientist Jacques Cousteau over 60 years ago. Despite years of study, scientists still do not fully understand the complex mechanisms that allow dolphins to learn so much about their surroundings via echolocation. Future scientists will continue to explore the mysteries of echolocation in an attempt to understand more fully this fascinating sensory system.", "score": 7.57440308896403e-05, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:3b2ee2aa-f65b-4329-9435-6bfe93426992>", "text": "Phil T.

Let me begin by saying the term is not interchangeable particularly when one is in conversation with artists from either or both categories.\nAlbeit a subset of street art, graffiti writing is a movement that is derived from the streets of New York and Philadelphia as far a back as mid 1960’s and has evolved as it spread across the world. It has always been closely associated with hip hop and has since become the visual representation of the culture.\nStreet art is not only seen in the form of painting public murals, it encompasses a variety of mediums and techniques, including: stencil art, mosaic tiling and projections onto large city buildings. It has always been a potent form of social expression.\nThe history of street art and graffiti in South Africa can be traced from its humble beginnings in the early 1980’s, on the Cape Flats (the low-income peripheral areas of Cape Town). Rooted in hip hop culture and boosted by a racially divided society; graffiti became a form self-expression and a political outcry.\nAesthetically, graffiti writers practice a more elaborate style of letters blended with different colors, while street art takes on many forms. Within this subculture there exists one main delineation between graffiti writers and street artists; ostensibly marked by the intention of the artist and distinguished in technique.\n“street artists might be insulted when called graffiti writers and vice versa”\nSome would say that street artists have taken on Dadaist concepts that iconic images of popular culture or even underwhelming objects can be elevated into symbols of expression. Street art is often depicted as urban adornment to decaying buildings, motivated by a preference on the part of the artist to communicate directly with the public; free from perceived confines of the formalities of the “art world”.\nSome street artists use “smart vandalism” as a way to raise awareness of social and political issues. Other street artists simply see urban space as an untapped format for personal artwork – taking the gallery to the streets. Both graffiti writers and street artist may appreciate the challenges and risks that are associated with installing illicit artwork in public places.\nI have subsequently learned that whether it be graffiti art or street art, I believe that for some, it is a way of life – it is part of their cultural DNA.\n“I have a saying that removing the grayness from the soul of the city is the job of artists, musicians and poets.", "score": 0.831275284, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:9ab84f43-ded8-41e6-9534-69444aa85850>", "text": "Friday, May 30, 2008 2:17:33 AM\ni know a guy with a garbage can tattooed above his butt. what is that supposed to mean? put ur junk in here? he also has a tattoo of a monkey sitting on a toilet blowing its brains out (its supposed to be like in the movie full metal jacket) hes a f*cking retard. i liked a couple of these tattoes but most of them those ppl are gonna regret when theyre all old and wrinkly.", "score": 0.830906391, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:265f22dd-204c-4a74-883d-0ef7ec15c7ed>", "text": "What makes an award-winning painting?

Even throw-ups and tags which to an untrained eye seem banal and meaningless may be considered creative and sufficiently original within the subculture.\nGraffiti has historically been an art movement that revolves around letter formation and calligraphy. Over the decades many original ways of drawing letters, and adorning them by adding arrows, crowns, curves, twists and other decorative elements, have been created and consolidated. And new lettering styles that seek to re-interpret, reconstruct and deconstruct the alphabet are still regularly created within graffiti communities.\nThat many tags may be considered original and therefore protectable by copyright is confirmed by the high level of competition between artists, who aim to distinguish their own lettering style from that of others. Accusations of copying throw-up and tag styles (what in graffiti jargon is defined as biting) are not uncommon within the graffiti scene. This indirectly confirms that more original letters, such as the ones developed by Dash Snow, are the result of creative effort.\nTake, for example, the famous Banksy’s tag. One may arguably claim it is very unique, and therefore eligible for copyright protection. The upright back of the capital letter “B” is missing; the letter “k” needs the “n” for a support; the top of the letter “s” is slightly cut off and the final “y” looks semi-dwarf. Tags are clearly far from simply written words – they are also images.\nThrow-ups and tags have undeniably grown in popularity and have attracted attention from marketing gurus always in search of new ideas capable of infusing street credibility into their commercial offers and making products more edgy and marketable. There have also been cases of street art falsely attributed to the real artist. And a variety of graffiti font styles are regularly offered for sale online for creative people and professionals to use in their urban artworks.\nThe belief that innovative lettering styles can be original enough to attract copyright protection is reinforced by the general principle enshrined in most copyright laws around the world that the quality of a work is not relevant for the purposes of copyright subsistence.

Their efforts have been replicated far beyond New York - in art galleries and in the hands of Arab Spring protesters - and yet their aspirations were largely apolitical: they were chasing fame and the acceptance of their peers.\nThe programme explores the city's complicated relationship with graffiti, which it appears to condemn and celebrate in equal measure.

According to their website the presence of graffiti and vandalism suggests disorder and lawlessness. Graffiti vandalism can contribute to decline in property value and, more importantly, generates the perception of increased crime and fear of gang activity. Some would argue this fact. Vehemently.\nThere haven’t really been any official studies quantifying the financial impact graffiti has on spaces, and there turns out to be a large misconception on graffiti artists in general. Research has shown that they are not the gang related youth that many label them as. In fact, they range in age from early teens to fifty years of age, some with full time jobs and families of their own.\nNonetheless, graffiti that is not commissioned and doesn’t have permission by a property owner is deemed a crime in our city and country.

Also seeking to protect Snow’s anti-consumerist reputation, they claim that McDonald’s has committed copyright infringement by using a “brazen copy” of Snow’s graffiti signature and featuring it on the walls of hundreds of its restaurants. Snow started his career as a graffiti artist with the crew IRAK.\nThis is just the latest in a string of cases where graffiti or street artists have brought copyright suits against corporations that have allegedly copied their pieces, including fashion companies Moschino and Cavalli, and clothing retailer American Eagle Outfitters. These cases were all settled out of court.\nYet the Dash Snow dispute is the first that seeks copyright protection of what within the graffiti subculture is called a throw-up. A stylistic signature representing the artist’s name, the throw-up is made of personalised (often bubble) letters, outlined in one colour and filled with another. Another, less sophisticated type of graffiti signature is the widely known “tag”, which consists of letters drawn in condensed calligraphic form. Both populate urban environments around the globe.\nThrow-ups and tags represent a strong desire to be recognised and appreciated within the subculture. They are basically street logos. They glorify identity and are mainly addressed to other graffiti artists within the community – often representing the first step in the career of what may eventually become a street artist.\nBut some may argue that throw-ups and tags lack a sufficient level of originality to be considered copyrightable, and are too trivial to attract protection.\nYet the debate about whether these street logos deserve such protection may be influenced by the fact that they are frequently perceived negatively by large sectors of society, as opposed to more elaborate pieces of street art, which are increasingly accepted and appreciated.\nOften considered to be mere scrawlings, which visually pollute our cities and require expensive cleaning by local councils, throw-ups and tags are also disliked by many because they are ubiquitous, sometimes associated with gangsterism, and (to the eyes of people outside the subculture) indecipherable.", "score": 0.02386096180036111, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:93313da7-0644-4461-8437-a5eb7f494f84>", "text": "Graffiti I dont care if its in the wrong place or not its beautiful its art i love it and the world needs more creativity we spend our live just living and doing nothing with ourselves we need to change things up and LIVE.

It was characterized by city-states ruled by kings, with a highly developed writing system, advanced astronomy, and complex calendar systems. The Maya were skilled in agriculture, architecture, and craftsmanship, building pyramids, temples, and palaces. Their culture was rich in art, religion, and rituals, including human sacrifice.\n\nThe Maya civilization declined around 900 AD, with reasons for the collapse still debated among scholars. Theories include environmental degradation, overpopulation, warfare, and political instability.

The beginnings of the Maya civilization have been dated to the 2 nd millennium BC. Around the 9 th century AD, however, the Maya civilization went into decline.\nMore precisely, however, it was the Maya cities of the southern lowlands that were abandoned one by one. Whilst the exact reason for the mysterious decline of the Maya is still unclear, several competing theories have been developed by scholars based on the available archaeological evidence.\nThe History of the Maya\nIt may be pointed out that the word ‘Maya’ is a modern collective term not used by the indigenous populations themselves. Unlike other indigenous populations of Mesoamerica, the Maya were concentrated in one geographical area, which corresponds to the modern area of southern Mexico, Guatemala, northern Belize, as well as the western parts of Honduras and El Salvador.\nMaya wooden handcrafted masks in a traditional Mexican market. (Jose Ignacio Soto / Adobe stock)\nThis area, however, may be divided into three sub-regions, each with its own environmental and cultural differences. These are the northern Maya lowlands, in the Yucatan Peninsula, the southern Maya lowlands, in northern Guatemala and the adjacent parts of Mexico, Belize, and western Honduras, and the southern Maya highlands, in southern Guatemala.\nThe Maya were never a unified civilization. Instead, in each of the three regions mentioned before, the Maya organized themselves into small states that were ruled by kings. It seems that each of these states was centered on a city, which would effectively make them city-states.\nThe absence of a unified Maya civilization is also reflected in their language. It has been pointed out that the earliest Maya used a common language. By the Pre-Classic period, however, this single language had experienced a diversification amongst the various Maya peoples. Today, there are about 70 different Mayan languages, spoken by around 5 million people.\nA Maya mask / stucco frieze from Placeres, Campeche.

There was never a central government between the Mayan cities nor any attempt to do so. The Mayan culture was a group of city-states that were independent, but shared a general culture, economy, and politics.\nThe Mayan culture spread throughout a great area. They were present in the Mexican states of Tabasco, Chiapas, Quintana Roo, Yucatan, and Campeche. They were also in Guatemala, Belize, El Salvador, and Honduras.\nLike many other civilizations in the past, the Mayans were created by the joining of many people in a small area. They settled at a crossroads, where North America meets with South America. It is a blind alley and quite narrow.\nThere were diverse environments in the zone. Mountainous regions existed to the south, in central America, and to the west, in Chiapas. In Guatemala, there were plains, as well as in Yucatan. Mountain rivers irrigated the land. The ocean could also be found all around their lands, in almost any direction.\nThe place where the Maya settled is very rich. The proximity with the ocean allowed the fishing of snails and shellfish, as well as using the seas as a trading route. There is also a great variety of flora and fauna, created by the mixing of those typically found in North America and those found in South America. There were many trees that could be used as raw materials. Special kinds of soil found in that area were important in construction. The quetzal, whose feathers were considered quite valuable, lived in those areas. Obsidian, which could be made into weapons or traded, was there due to nearby volcanos.\nHistoryThe First Mayas\nThe ancestors of the Maya arrived from Asia like all other pre-hispanic people, through the Bering Straight. It is known that during 2500 BC, they settled where the state of Veracruz1 now exists. During this time, there were people in the lands of the Maya, but those were other groups that would move on.\nThese early Mayas began spreading south, following the coast.

Instead, there were as many as 20 separate areas, similar to ancient Greece city-states. Each major city had its own ruler and noble class supported by smaller cities and the surrounding farms and villages.\n- The Ancient Maya developed the science of astronomy, calendar systems and hieroglyphic writing. They were also known for creating elaborate ceremonial architecture, such as pyramids, temples, palaces and observatories. These structures were all built without metal tools.\n- The Mayan people were also skilled farmers. In order to farm, they had to clear huge sections of tropical rain forest. Groundwater was scarce in these areas, so they had to build large underground reservoirs to store the rainwater.\n- The Maya were skilled weavers and potters. They also cleared routes through jungles and swamps to create trade routes. This allowed them to sell and trade the goods they had made for goods they needed.\n- The Maya writing system was made up of 800 glyphs. Some of the glyphs were pictures and others represented sounds. They chiseled the glyphs into stone and inside codices. Codices were books that were folded like an accordion. The pages were fig bark covered in white lime and bound in jaguar skins. The Maya wrote hundreds of these books. They contained information on history, medicine, astronomy and their religion. The Spanish missionaries burned all but four of these books.\n- The Ancient Mayans were a very religious people. Mayan actions were based on rituals and ceremonies. The Maya had many different gods. They also had rituals. One of those rituals was human sacrifice. The Mayan Kings were considered to be direct descendants of the Mayan Gods. Mayan religion was divided into three parts with earth as one part, the level above the earth as another part, and the level below the earth as the third part.

Despite more than a century of archaeological investigation and glyphic decipherment, the nature of Maya political organization and political geography has remained an open question. Many debates have raged over models of centralization versus decentralization, superordinate and subordinate status—with far-flung analogies to emerging states in Europe, Asia, and Africa. But Prudence Rice asserts that neither the model of two giant \"superpowers\" nor that which postulates scores of small, weakly independent polities fits the accumulating body of material and cultural evidence.\nIn this groundbreaking book, Rice builds a new model of Classic lowland Maya (AD 179-948) political organization and political geography. Using the method of direct historical analogy, she integrates ethnohistoric and ethnographic knowledge of the Colonial-period and modern Maya with archaeological, epigraphic, and iconographic data from the ancient Maya. On this basis of cultural continuity, she constructs a convincing case that the fundamental ordering principles of Classic Maya geopolitical organization were the calendar (specifically a 256-year cycle of time known as the may) and the concept of quadripartition, or the division of the cosmos into four cardinal directions. Rice also examines this new model of geopolitical organization in the Preclassic and Postclassic periods and demonstrates that it offers fresh insights into the nature of rulership, ballgame ritual, and warfare among the Classic lowland Maya.\n- Note on Orthography and Dates\n- 1.

Modern Maya, honoring old traditions, abandoned human victims in favor of domestic chickens.\nLong before the invention of anesthesia, Mayan physicians made anesthetics from various plants. They were used in operations and religious rituals.\nMayan doctors were able to put dentures in place of lost teeth.\nAt the time of this civilization, a ball game reminiscent of modern football was very popular.\nThe Maya had a highly developed writing system.

(See Table 1.1.)\nWhat do the terms \"political\" and \"political organization\" mean? Anthropologists have grappled with this question for many decades, because what constitutes politics or a political system in modern Western society may be more elusive or opaque in non-Western ones. For archaeologists, the problems of comprehending political arrangements are exacerbated, being restricted to aspects deducible from the fragmentary material record of prehistoric societies.\nMuch anthropological thinking on political systems in prehistory dates from early British functionalism and structural-functionalism of the 1940s. Theorists such as A. R. Radcliffe-Brown (1940), M. G. Smith (1960, 1968), and others (see Cohen and Middleton 1967; de Montmollin 1989; Kurtz 2001:68-80) defined \"the political\" in a complex society by\n- its structures:\n- an administrative or organizational sector, usually hierarchical, of policy- or decision-making roles, and\n- a \"political\" sector where decisions are made and competition for power takes place; and also\n- 2. its functions: rules and sanctions that implement policy, maintain societal order, and safeguard territorial sovereignty.\nModern political anthropology has strayed little from this structural-functional milieu (Kurtz 2001; cf. Roscoe 1993), and this is also true for studies of the Classic Maya civilization, although the latter have been amplified by analogy to modern Maya and readings of contemporaneous texts.

Together, these sources reveal that Maya political organization was structured by short-and long-term temporal cycles recorded in their calendars, particularly recurring intervals of approximately twenty years (the k'atun) and 256 years (the may).

The collapse of the maya civilization is considered one of of the lost ancient culture of the maya and astronomy was superior but why did they practice.Download", "score": 0.29927510569954413, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:e8b5995a-f777-454c-8aa9-7f7af53b264a>", "text": "Pyramids peek above the canopy of the Guatemalan jungle in Central America, but the roots of the ruins run a lot deeper than it looks.\nA LIDAR (\"light\" and \"radar\") survey of the area has revealed 60,000 previously unknown structures - suggesting a vast megalopolis that was home to millions more people than previously thought.\nMapping a 2,100 square kilometre (800 square mile) area of jungle around the Lost World city of Tikal - a popular tourist destination - a team of researchers found palaces, bridges, fortifications, dwellings, and other human-made features that have been lost for centuries.\nThe city is enormous - three to four times larger than previously thought.\n\"The LIDAR images make it clear that this entire region was a settlement system whose scale and population density had been grossly underestimated,\" Thomas Garrison, an Ithaca College archaeologist told National Geographic.\nAs digital technology becomes more sophisticated, it is growing increasingly useful for research.

Periodically, cities would be abandoned by elite groups or sometimes by the whole population. This happened for several reasons – infighting and political intrigue, famine and plague. At Mayapan, we know from historical records, the noble Xiu clan massacred their Cocom rivals, usually cited as the reason for its abandonment in 1441-1461 CE, but the city might have suffered endemic violence for two centuries before this. Perhaps Cancuén and other Classic Maya cities had similar problems that led eventually to their collapse and abandonment.\nAlmost nine centuries after the massacre at Cancuén, in 1697 CE, the armies of the Spanish destroyed the last independent Maya kingdom – the kingdom of the Itzas, based at the island city of Nojpetén. As Christians, they destroyed the pagan ‘idols’ that they found but they did not kill the royal family. Nojpetén’s last king, Ajaw Kan Ek’, was captured and baptised and renamed Joseph Pablo; he learned Spanish, and ended up living in the colonial town of Santiago de Guatemala. And it was the Christian Spanish who sought to destroy the ancient Maya culture – thousands of Maya books were burnt (only four remain today), and Maya families were broken up with children forcibly re-educated. Even so, millions of Maya descendants live in central America today.\nThe idea of a collapse of Maya civilisation seems just wrong – and it carries with it the wrong kind of implications – that the Maya all disappeared or that their post-collapse culture is less important or less worthy of our attention. Via many individual collapses, Classic Maya society transformed through the Terminal Classic and into the Postclassic – a development that is hardly surprising when compared with the changing map of Europe across any five-century period.

The BMI heuristic attempts to maximize the time buffer prior to the bottleneck machine, thereby minimizing potential bottleneck idleness, while also looking-ahead to sequence the lots with large remaining process time earlier in the schedule. A detailed experimental study is performed to show that the BMI heuristic outperforms the Fast Insertion Heuristic (the best known heuristic for flow-shop scheduling), when modified for Lot Streaming (FIHLS) and applied to the problem on hand.\nFor the FSLS problem, several algorithms are developed. For the two-machine FSLS problem with an identical sublot-size for all the lots, an optimal pseudo-polynomial solution algorithm is proposed. For all practical purposes (i.e., even for very large lot sizes), this algorithm is very fast. For the case in which the sublot-sizes are lot-based, optimal and heuristic procedures are developed. The heuristic procedure is developed to reduce the complexity of the optimal solution algorithm. It consists of a construction phase and an improvement phase. In the construction phase, it attempts to find a near-optimal sequence for the lots and then, in the improvement phase, given the sequence, it attempts to optimize the lot-based sublot-sizes of each of the lots. Extensions of the solution procedures are proposed for the general m-machine FSLS problem.\nA comprehensive simulation study of a flow shop system under lot streaming is conducted to support the validity of the results and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the heuristic procedures. This study clearly indicates that, even in dynamic practical situations, the BMI rule, which is based on the proposed BMI heuristic, outperforms existing WIP rules, commonly used in industry, in scheduling a flow-shop that utilizes lot streaming. With respect to the primary performance measure - cycle time (or MFT) - the BMI rule demonstrates a clear improvement over other WIP rules. It is further shown that it also outperforms other WIP rules with respect to the output variability measure, another important measure in flow-shop systems.

A number of technical points need to be settled in connection with this setup, such as the assumptions (if any) needed to justify computing moments of element values by, in effect, repeatedly instantiating and evaluating a structured model that is \"A-partially specified\" (in the jargon of Geoffrion [1989a]). Then one would need to study how to perform such calculations efficiently in the simulation context.\nTwo adaptations of structured modeling to DES are particularly noteworthy. See also Ma, Tian and Zhou , which adds a logical formalism to SM for the purpose of describing dynamics.\nLenard  sketches three DES-motivated extensions of SML, actually new kinds of elements: random attributes (see above), actions (which describe state transitions), and transactions (used to describe complex events in terms of a sequence of previously defined actions and transactions). Lenard [1993b] describes a prototype model management system based on these ideas that was implemented in a database environment (ORACLE 6.0). The database schema is not model-specific as in SML, but rather is fixed for all models. In addition, there are major restrictions of SML. The implementation (developed under contract to the U.S. Coast Guard) makes extensive use of the ORACLE tools SQL*Forms and SQL*Menu; in particular, most user interaction is through forms selected from a set of pop-down menus. Among the system's features is the ability to convert extended structured models to SIMSCRIPT II.5 code. The code generation is done entirely in SQL*Plus (ORACLE's version of the standard query language, SQL).\nThe approach taken by Pollatschek  is quite different.

More closely related to urban and architectural modeling, Alegre and Dellaert  present a probabilistic image-based approach to the semantic interpretation of building facades. Their method is based on constructing a Bayesian generative model from stochastic context-free grammars that encode knowledge about facades. This model combines low-level segmentation and high-level hierarchical labelling so that the levels reinforce each other and produce a detailed hierarchical partition of the depicted facade into structural blocks. MCMC sampling is used to approximate the posterior over partitions of a given image. Merrell et al.  (and also Yu et al. ) propose methods for searching in a parameterized interior design space for architectural models. Their interactive furniture layout system assists users by suggesting furniture arrangements that are based on interior design guidelines. The system quantifies layout guidelines using a weighted sum of scores and rapidly samples the underlying function using a hardware-accelerated Monte Carlo sampler. The results demonstrate an increase in the quality of furniture arrangements produced by participants with no prior training in interior design. A related data-driven method for architectural programming automatically generates building layouts for computer graphics applications . Given a set of high-level requirements, an architectural program is synthesized using a Bayesian network trained on real-world data. The architectural program is realized in a set of floor plans, obtained through stochastic optimization. The floor plans are used to construct a 3D building with internal structure. While not strictly performing an inverse procedural modeling, it does follow a similar data-driven learning approach.\nTalton et al.  take as input a stochastic context-free grammar and explore the possible strings generated by the grammar to find a production sequence that yields a target 3D shape. The production is generated by performing maximum a posteriori estimation over the space of possible productions from the grammar. The algorithm supports specifications of many forms, including geometric shapes and analytical objectives.

Having too many top-level blocks can lead to numerous local decisions that can overconstrain the problem and produce low-quality, suboptimal results. Don MacMillen, vice president of advanced technology at Synopsys Inc. (San Jose, Calif.), recently showed that the portion of the design solution space explored when using just four blocks is already less than 1 percent of the total space available using flat approaches and decreases exponentially with the number of blocks.\nTo efficiently explore the numerous permutations of the floor plan, block size, and shapes and performance budgets not only requires complex partitioning and floor planning tools, but can invariably lead to numerous design iterations and problems with design convergence.\nIn addition, there will be a significant impact to the chip size due to the additional area (for example, power ring) devoted to the boundary of all the blocks. On the other hand, too few chip-level blocks can result in large blocks with several thousand and perhaps even millions of gates. This makes it even more difficult to accurately model chip-level routing, which is so heavily dependent on gate placement inside each block-and which is unknown in the partitioning stage.\nLarge blocks also warrant physical place and route tools that can efficiently implement them with quick turnaround and high design quality. Consequently, any hierarchical approach must carefully plan the number of levels of hierarchy as well as the number, size and nature of blocks at each level.\nFundamental to any block-based design is a bottom-up floor planning and assembly of blocks that requires accurate abstraction, characterization and packaging of intellectual property (IP). Since blocks could be in various stages of implementation-ranging from \"soft\" RTL-level descriptions, to partially placed \"firm\" IP blocks, to fully placed and routed \"hard\" blocks-supporting incremental block/chip assembly is imperative. Engineers must be able to see what the chip will look like without having to wait until all the blocks are complete before integrating them.

Details of the distinctions between them would take us far afield.\nThe important aspect of deep sequencing is that it is a massively parallel means of constructing DNA sequences for entire communities of organisms by piecing together information from a huge number of fragments. You do not have to guess what you are looking for the way you do with ordinary PCR probes.\nThe surprise from this work for me lay not in the discoveries concerning CF, but in the viral communities (viromes) of healthy individuals. They found an average of 243 species of virus, some 90% previously unknown in any context. This was with methodology that was not suitable for detecting RNA viruses, which predominate in respiratory infections.\nThey were not specifically looking for retroviruses either, (retroviruses are RNA viruses which must use reverse transcription to generate DNA they can insert). Sequences probably resulting from reverse transcription convinced them some unidentified retroviruses were present.\nI want to reassure people that most viruses, even those in human beings, are not human pathogens. They are generally there to attack numerous bacteria, some of which may be pathogens. Viruses which attack bacteria are called bacteriophages, commonly abbreviated to phages. Dusting a powder with selected phage viruses on wounds has even been used (in the Soviet Union) as a means of protecting wounds from bacterial pathogens without damaging human cells around the wound, as antiseptics do.\nFor those interested in the history of science, this is a classic example of breakthrough research.

They are the largest burrowing clams in the world with an average weight of 1.5 pounds, and some have weighed in at 15 pounds. The siphon, which is sometimes referred to as its “neck” or when loosely translated in Chinese “elephant trunk” protrudes the shell and can grow up to 1 metre long! It is called an “elephant trunk” in China because when preparing the geoduck for a dish, the siphon has two main valves that filter saltwater in and out of its body for plankton. The outside body and these valves distinctly resemble an elephant trunk. Pacific Geoducks are one of the longest living animals on the planet with a lifespan up to 140 years and the oldest recorded living species was 168 years old. Their longevity is largely due to having no serious natural predators. Another contributing factor is their ability to bury themselves extremely quickly up to 1 metre deep (Underwater Harvesters Association, 2014). Similar to counting the age of a tree their age can be roughly determined by the growth rings on their shell. The Pacific Geoduck is popularly known in Canada as the “King Clam” due to its size and prestigious reputation.\nWhen a Geoduck is harvested at low tide the person who is harvesting the animal has a special pump similar to a ghost shrimp pump in his or her hand and grabs the geoduck at the top of the siphon. As the geoducks burrows down into the mud the person harvesting hangs onto the geoduck with their hand and sending the pump down with it flushing out surfaces for the geoduck to dig. As the harvestor follows the specimen they often have to stick their entire arm in the mud before the geoduck releases its grip – so they literally have to lie flat on their side before they can bring it up.

While some animals like lions like the direct approach, some animals have developed crafty and clever methods to seize their meals. Below you’ll discover a few unique methods animals use to catch prey.\nGreen Herons Use Bait to Lure Fish\nGreen herons act like fishers to get their meals. To catch fish, they will find bait, like seeds, berries, and twigs, to attract them. Some herons even create a fishing rod out of twigs to dangle in front of fish. Once the fish tries nibbling at the bait the heron will grab it.\nFrogfish Implement Their Modified Dorsal Fin\nThe frogfish is a small creature that tends to live in tropical environments. To catch meals, they use their modified dorsal fin. This fin is located on the top of their head and attaches to their spine. At the end of this fin is a dangling piece that resembles a shrimp. As the frogfish swims around, this shrimp-like piece will float near their mouth. When a fish swims over to eat the “shrimp”, the frogfish will capture them.\nArcherfish Spit at Their Prey\nArcherfish enjoy munching on insects, smaller fish, and shrimp. Despite their somewhat tiny size, archerfish have a powerful mechanism for seizing prey.\nTo find food, an archerfish will float near the top of the water. Once something catches its eye, it will slightly tilt its body and then send a strong squirt of water toward it. The force of the water will shock the prey and knock it off balance. This gives the archerfish time to swim over and get it.\nArcherfish are known for their precision when they spit so they rarely miss. When they find potential food, they will create a groove on the roof of their mouth while making a tunnel with their tongue. They’ll then contract their gills to gain pressure in their body and then spit a stream toward the unlucky visitor.\nAlligator Snapping Turtles Stay Still and Release a Worm-Like Appendage\nThe alligator snapping turtle is one of the largest freshwater turtles in North America.

The students would run in a circle, stomping their feet, getting tighter and tighter.

Narwhals were likely called “corpse whales” because of their pale, mottled coloring that made them look like drowned sailors! Sometimes also called “the Arctic unicorn,” narwhals are small whales (about 15-16 feet long) that live in the icy waters of the Atlantic and Russian areas of the Arctic Ocean, near Canada and Greenland.\nNarwhals are most closely related to the beluga whale. Male narwhals feature a unique, defining physical characteristic: a long protrusion from the upper left jaw that looks like a tusk or a horn. The narwhal is a uniquely specialized Arctic predator. In winter, it feeds on benthic prey, mostly flatfish, under dense pack ice. During the summer, narwhals mostly eat Arctic cod and Greenland halibut, with other fish such as polar cod making up the remainder of their diet. Each year, they migrate from bays into the ocean as summer comes.\nIn the winter, the male narwhals occasionally dive up to 1,500 m (4,920 ft) in depth, with dives lasting up to 25 minutes. In fact, narwhals are known for making some of the deepest dives of any marine mammal. Narwhals have been known to dive to depths of over 2,500 feet over 15 times per day, with some dives reaching as deep as almost 5,000 feet! Narwhals, like most toothed whales, communicate with “clicks”, “whistles”, and “knocks”. Narwhals can live up to 50 years. They are often killed by suffocation when the sea ice freezes over. Another cause of fatality, specifically among young whales, is starvation.\nThe current population of the narwhal is about 75,000, so narwhals qualify for Near Threatened under the criterion of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Narwhals have been harvested for over a thousand years by Inuit people in northern Canada and Greenland for meat and ivory, and a regulated subsistence hunt continues.", "score": 0.835697293, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:484271a7-0b0e-4c1f-83bf-7dc2856b4cf4>", "text": "The other unique thing about this block was my encounter with the first \"difficult\" letter of the alphabet.

Preying on creatures primarily on the bottom of the sea, they dive on average 800 m (.5 mi.), but can go twice that. The dives last around 25 minutes. In the summer, narwhals feed rarely, having stored up enough energy during the winter feeding season. They return to the same feeding grounds each year.\nNarwhals are preyed upon by polar bears and walruses if they get trapped by shifting ice. Off shore they are attacked by killer whales (also known as orcas), to whom they are also related. In the summer, narwhals are also hunted by Inuits using kayaks and spears.\nNarwhals are currently considered a species of least concern by the IUCN Red List, but many of the areas inhabited by narwhals are subject to drilling and mining, which produces waste that is dangerous to all animal populations.

If you struck out there, you could venture to Greenland or Svalbard. Narwhals navigate polynyas, which are pools of open water in otherwise iced-over environments. They're the arctic equivalent of an oasis. That's not the only reason polynyas are interesting -- they're biodiverse marine environments, rich in organisms like phytoplankton and copepods (little crustaceans) that serve as feeding grounds for birds, walruses and whales.\nYou could spot the male whale (and a few female whales) by its long, spiral tusk, but what else could you look for?

If you see a little gray narwhal with no white patches, that's a baby, whereas a completely white narwhal is probably an old whale.\nStill not sure it's a narwhal? Don't look for a dorsal fin, because it only has a dorsal ridge, which makes it easier to swim under ice. Narwhals travel in groups -- usually 20 or 30 at a time, although during migration, you might see thousands of them together. A female narwhal weighs in at around 2,200 pounds (998 kg), with males at 3,500 pounds (1,588 kg).

From the looks of it, this contestant has just introduced herself and is starting her strut down the runway.\nThe bathing suit and figure of the contestant clearly exemplify the styles of the Sixties. However, for a daytime beauty contest on a beach, all the participants are highly overdressed. The contestant is wearing high-heeled pumps and is coifed in the style of the era, though more adequate for big city life than for the seaside. The compère and the judges are wearing dark suits, again much too formal for the beach and probably quite uncomfortable in the sun.\nThis is one of two photographs with the same title seen in the exhibition “Only in England“ at the Science Museum in London, presenting photographs by Tony Ray-Jones and Martin Parr. The other image shows a group of bored contestants and oblivious contest officials backstage.\nBathing suit beauty contests were extremely popular in the Sixties, particularly in England. The oldest international beauty competition, Miss World, actually started in England in the late Fifties. Yet despite this popularity, the public at this contest show absolutely no interest in it. This struck a cord with me.\nHaving been a beauty contest fan since the Sixties, I started organizing beauty contests in the late Eighties.

At the ripe old age of 11, he would start to compete in major contests such as the Del Mar Ocean Festival with the Z-Boys. Three years later in San Francisco, he would go on to win his first professional freestyle contest under the sponsorship of Gordon & Smith. During the mid '70s, as pool riding came into the skateboard scene, Doug shifted his focus to pools and vertical terrain in addition to maintaining his freestyle capabilities. As a matter of fact in 1978, Doug came out of competing in the Hester Pro Bowl Series to win the Oceanside Professional Freestyle contest. From that point on and throughout his skateboard career, he would continue go on and place high in all of the competitions that he would enter whether it was pool or freestyle. This vertical pioneer would also serve as an ambassador, traveling to Japan and Canada with the Gordon & Smith team for some mind-blowing demos. Doug was a hero to many young skaters, including fellow San Diego native and Oasis Skatepark local Tony Hawk.\nDoug continued to skate into the early 1980s, and then gradually drifted into other interests such as playing music. But now (thanks to the efforts of his four-year-old son Shey, the encouragement of his wife Alethia and brother-in-law) he is back on the board and ripping the pools and parks with the same smooth style of his youth.

There are few people involved with drum corps today who do not equate “Tony” with Tony DiCarlo.”\nIn his important role, DiCarlo has his hand in a number of facets of the show-day experience, from keeping corps entrances, performances and exits running on time and on schedule, to making sure that the judges have what they need and are ready to go for each corps’ performance, and that sideline and field conditions are consistent and safe throughout the course of the contest.\n“Without Tony and his contest crew, none of this would be as satisfying to our members and our fan base,” said longtime DCI judge and 1992 Hall of Fame inductee George Oliviero. “They are constantly behind the scenes doing the work that makes an evening with our corps so entertaining.

It is not an usual occurrence but it often crops up. They are vaguely aware, from the requests of their lawyers, that they have to make their office secure by addressing both their network security and physical security. When we started KISI, we were equally confused and unaware of this either. So we did a little digging.\nWhat is HIPAA?\nHIPAA stands for Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.\nAccording to HIPAA standards, “The HIPAA Privacy Rule addresses the saving, accessing and sharing of medical and personal information of any individual, while the HIPAA Security Rule more specifically outlines national security standards to protect health data created, received, maintained or transmitted electronically, also known as electronic protected health information (ePHI).\nYour duty as a HIPAA compliant company is it to prevent unauthorized physical access to Protected Health Information (PHI).\nThese four standards in the Physical Safeguards are\n- Facility Access Controls,\n- Workstation Use,\n- Workstation Security and\n- Devices and Media Controls.\nIn addition to ensuring robust network security in the office through establishing firewalls, encrypted data, communication policies, background checks, secure servers, Two Factor Authentication (2FA) and all the other digital measures you need to be compliant with, physical security matters as much even though it is often under-looked.\nWe realized that Facility Access Control is the most relevant HIPAA standard that most access control systems have to comply with.\nHIPAA Standard: Facility Access Control\nHere’s a typical scenario: most companies usually get a key card (or key fob / card key) system in the first place. The downside? According to the requirements of the US HSS, most might not actually be complying with the standard.\nHere is the original excerpt about the requirements in terms of access control by the law:\nFacility Access and Control. A covered entity must limit physical access to its facilities while ensuring that authorized access is allowed.\nIn brief, it mentions everything that is required from you to make your physical access and facility access HIPAA compliant. (If you are interested in the granular details of the standard, you can read the standards here.)\nThat explains why our potential clients were asking us about HIPAA compliance.

They enable risk management programs by counteracting, detecting, minimizing, or avoiding security risks to computer systems, data, software, and networks.\nThey include technical controls as well as operational, administrative, and architectural controls.\nAdditionally, controls can be preventative, detective, corrective, or compensatory.\nPhysical security controls\nPhysical controls describe anything tangible thatâ€™s used to prevent or detect unauthorized access to physical areas, systems, or assets. This includes things like fences, gates, guards, security badges and access cards, biometric access controls, security lighting, CCTVs, surveillance cameras, motion sensors, fire suppression, as well as environmental controls like HVAC and humidity controls.\nTechnical security controls\nTechnical security controls focus on hardware and software. They control access and use across the network. Some best practices include encryption, smartcards, network authentication, access control lists (ACLs), and file integrity auditing software.\nAdministrative security controls\nAdministrative security controls are also referred to as procedural control. The controls focus on day-to-day operations and often come from standards or regulation. Best practices include information security policies and procedures, vendor risk management programs, business continuity policies, and disaster recovery policies.\nTypes of Security Control\nPreventative controls work to prevent data loss. Controls such as two-factor authentication, least privilege necessary, identity management, and cloud access management allow organizations to protect their perimeter by understanding who accessed data and how they used it.\nDetective controls focus on identifying weaknesses.", "score": 0.848878503, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:89b6e6a2-ab59-4753-93f3-e010db290f30>", "text": "- To promote and encourage compliance with applicable law, rules, contracts, grant agreements and practices.\n- To support economical and efficient operations.\n- To ensure reliability of financial records and reports.\n- To safeguard assets.

Depending on how big your organization may be you may have multiple managers on the ground supervising and ensuring secure continuity through the globe. Most companies break these managers down by regions…LATAM, North A, Asia. Managers are then broken down into responsibilities..regional, site, directors, etc…If your organization is small, under 500 employees and all under one roof then it can be quite streamline.\nA small organization that’s in one place can have one main CSO-Corporate Security Officer that can set policy and systems and then delegate to managers that they be put in place and executed.

Having systems and procedures in place for managing PII – Personal Identifiable Information and just all around cyber slopinnes is going to be key in a post pandemic workplace, some workers will come back to the office but many are going to stay home. What measures can be put in place in order to achieve maximum cyber security for the organization? Here are some clear clear metrics you can track and present to your stakeholders:\n- Level of preparedness: How many devices on your network are fully patched and up to date?\n- Unidentified devices on internal networks\n- Intrusion attempts: How many times have bad actors attempted to gain unauthorized access?\n- Security incidents: How many times has an attacker breached your information assets or networks?", "score": 0.843684435, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:7034f8da-557a-4cf3-9f51-5ba926b9732f>", "text": "Protecting maritime transport and seaports against terrorism\nGovernments worldwide have taken measures to better protect ports and maritime transport against terrorism. This began after the attacks on 11 September 2001 in the US.\nPort and maritime security levels\nThe International Ship and Port Facility Security Code is aimed at detecting terrorism threats and preventing acts of terrorism at ports and on the sea. The ISPS Code defines 3 security levels:\n- Level 1\nNormal: this is the level of threat at which port facilities and ships normally operate; minimum appropriate protective security measures must be maintained at all times.\n- Level 2\nHeightened Risk: appropriate additional protective security measures must be maintained for a period of time as a result of the heightened risk of a security incident.\n- Level 3\nIncident Imminent: further specific protective security measures must be maintained for a period of time when a security incident is probable or imminent. For instance, access may be restricted and stringent controls may apply to persons and goods.\nFurthermore, the ISPS Code also stipulates that port authorities and ships must have an approved security plan in place. In addition, a security officer must also be present on ships and at terminals.\nThe European Union adopted and supplemented the IASP Code in Regulation (EC) No. 2004/725.\nThe Dutch government has incorporated these international and European security requirements into:\n- Schepenbesluit 2004 (Shipping Decree);\n- Havenbeveiligingswet (Port Security Act);\n- Several ministerial regulations.\nIn recent years, maritime transport all over the world has suffered considerably from the threats and acts of piracy. Incidents have occurred in, for example, Southeast Asia, the Niger Delta and off the coast of Somalia.\nThe government is collaborating with other seafaring countries and the maritime sector to combat piracy. The cabinet decided that in 2015 the Dutch navy would participate in anti-piracy operations off the coast of Somalia. These operations were aimed at protecting humanitarian transports and merchant shipping.\nIn 2010, the Netherlands became party to the Regional Cooperation Agreement on Anti-Piracy in Asia (ReCAAP). The aim of this regional agreement is to combat piracy through increased information sharing and cooperation between the signatories. The Netherlands is an active participant in the agreement.", "score": 0.0024946134526294896, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:e47ac849-74e5-4c3f-9e23-74e1400f03b4>", "text": "This will remove all but small amounts of water from the pipes and will prevent them from bursting should there be a freeze.\" Also, \"Remember to turn off your heating at the controls if you decide to shut off the water.\"\n4. Energy Efficiency\nBefore you close the doors to your workplace for the holidays, make sure to go around and turn off \"vampire appliances\" - devices that continue to draw power even when not in use. The main offenders are chargers, printers, microwaves, TVs, routers, and other non-essential equipment. This not only conserves energy but minimises the risk of electrical fires and reduces your overall energy bill.\n5. Timed Lights\nEnhance your security and warn off unwanted visitors by setting up timed lights. Create a schedule that mimics your normal working hours to deter potential intruders. Timed lights not only function as a deterrent but also save energy by avoiding unnecessary illumination during the entire holiday period.\n6. Security Measures\nBefore closing, it's a good idea to conduct a thorough security check. Ensure all windows and doors are securely locked. Looking for an upgrade to your current lock system for an added layer of protection? Find a local locksmith to help minimise the risk of break-ins, theft, and vandalism during the holiday closure.\n7. Backups and Data Protection\nWhile protecting the physical business is crucial, so is protecting your data security. Ensure that sensitive data is protected and consider implementing additional cybersecurity measures. This proactive approach minimises the risk of data loss and means there are no data nightmares when you return to work.\nAs you wind down for your holiday break, putting together a plan for your workplace security will safeguard not only your assets and data but also your peace of mind. By following these tips, you'll not only ensure the safety of your workplace but also set the stage for a seamless return to work\nFor expert assistance in ensuring the safe running of your workplace, contact Rightio.

Compliance, whether voluntary or mandatory, will depend on the type of company and/or its residence.\nBelow is a general vision of the majority of security standards, regulations, and controls:\nAs seen in the graphic above, there are several. However, they all aim to mitigate security risks that ensure the attributes of data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. In other words, day by day, protecting information is vital and these standards and regulations intersect at that end.\nProtecting information not only implies controls at a technological level, but also in all the company’s critical resources, these are: people, technology, physical and digital Information, and tangible assets. For this reason, establishing a Robust Security Government is essential and the best way forward.\nAlthough some standards and regulations focus on a single attribute or a combination of them, in this article we will explain that in order to mitigate data risks efficiently and effectively over time, compliance with the 3 attributes as a whole is essential.\nIf we talk about data risks, each attribute is presented according to different risk scenarios. For example:\nFor this, it is necessary to establish several preventive, detective, and corrective controls. For example:\nNext, some examples of similarities and differences between them:\nWith all this in mind, let’s take a look at another example. If a company located in Virginia, USA makes the decision to comply with a voluntary standard such as ISO22701/2, and over time, with significant growth in revenue and customers, opens an office in California, USA, where CCPA compliance is required, their efforts and investment to accomplish this goal will be minimal.\nThat said, when asked if these standards and regulations are related to each other, the answer is YES. These standards and regulations overlap in many ways with security controls, which include processes, policies, and technologies designed to protect information.\nLooking to establish a robust and sustainable information security program? Do not hesitate to contact Flugel.it, who will help you define the best strategy for your company.\nTheir virtual CISO service focuses on ensuring that you are truly prepared to comply voluntarily or under obligation with any security standard or regulation, such as: SOC2, ISO, GDPR, CCPA, NIST, and HIPAA, among others.\n2018, Cryptoland Theme by Artureanec - Ninetheme", "score": 0.0005413716802133071, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:2ba427bc-9cfb-4a20-9334-dbdd24639dee>", "text": "Our customers entrust us, FitLyfe with one of their most valuable assets, their data.

According to our recent research, four in 10 organizations surveyed indicate they have a history of BYOD-related breaches in security. Nearly half the respondents believe that BYOD practices may threaten auditing and compliance obligations. Other concerns cited include loss of infrastructure control and data as well as the danger of a company’s restricted, proprietary information getting into the wrong hands when an employee’s device is lost or stolen.\nBut the BYOD trend continues regardless, forcing security to develop, implement and enforce appropriate security measures to ensure their organization’s assets are protected while still enabling the benefits of BYOD to be realized.\nThe answer to this conundrum lies in recognizing that BYOD is a disruptive trend you need to meet head-on. You win against BYOD by embracing it, by taking a proactive approach to working with employees, business partners and clients to understand their needs, then developing security policies that increase business value and productivity, while concurrently protecting corporate assets and managing costs. Focus on securing corporate information rather than on securing the devices. A critical success factor is to ensure continuity in security policies between laptops, tablets, smartphones, personal and corporate devices.\nHow to Manage the Risks?\nTo effectively manage the risks associated with BYOD access, first identify the needs and requirements of your organization. Who in your company wants or needs to access the corporate network from their personal devices? What systems do their devices utilize? Should you limit how many devices you support? What IT infrastructure, software and licensing is required? What sort of access do you want to allow – to emails, customer databases, financial documents?\nYou also need to establish a clear policy and then a combination of the right tools to implement it, the trust with which to deliver it to employees and the operational processes that everyone understands and buys into. Particularly essential is educating the workforce why security measures – and the BYOD policies – are essential to the protection of corporate data. To help employees understand the need for controls and gain acceptance and compliance, you should tailor training and education to explain why such protections are necessary and what the risks are to the individual and the company of not having them in place.

Another reason for choosing a high bootleg is the nature of the obstacles: the height of the snow cover, the high wet grass, the presence of creeks and streams on the way that you need to wade through. It is logical that the lower the shoes, the more likely that snow or water will get inside. In dry summer weather, the high bootleg is useless, and the winter footwear for men with strong frost must be high and wide enough to allow easy filling of trousers in.\nWeight depends on the following factors: material (artificial lighter than natural); sole (high-quality porous materials that provide good cushioning, thermal insulation, but the weight remains at a comfortable level); accessories and amplifiers (laces and hooks, additional materials in places prone to rubbing, etc.); size and height. Lightweight shoes are more comfortable during long transitions; heavy is more functional. Shoes for the mountains or rough terrain and winter are bigger. Shoes for dry summer weather and relatively flat terrain are light.\nIn small shoes it will be cold, callouses will appear, and just for a long time to be in them is inconvenient. In the big – the leg will hang out, which also leads to calluses, as well as to injuries. The same applies to the width. The size of shoes and boots is better to choose 1-1.5 more than an ordinary size of footwear. The distance from the fingers to the toe of the shoes should be about an inch. To check this, you need to move the foot to the toe and place the finger between the heel and the boot.

Because the measurements are not standardized, it is challenging to compare one brand to another. Here are some rough guidelines though:\n- For most brands, under 10,000 g/m2 is low breathability and adequate for walking around town and other low-key activities.\n- Casual hikers and skiers should aim for fabrics with at least 10,000g/m2\n- Runners and high-intensity hikers should aim for pants with 20,000 g/m2 or higher rating\nA NOTE ON BREATHABILITY: Don’t expect to be sweat-free when wearing breathable pants, though. Sweat can pass through the micropores in the waterproof membrane, but you will sweat faster than the sweat can escape. You will get sweaty even with the best breathable gear.\nThere are ways you can slow down this sweat build-up.\nFirst, you can slow down your pace so you don’t sweat as much. This is especially critical during the winter when a dripping sweat can chill you to the bone.\nYou also can use ventilation if your pants have it. These side zippers can be opened to allow cooling air to circulate inside the pants. Once the air floods in, you can cool yourself off quickly.\nOther Rain Wear\nPants are only one option when it comes to keeping your legs dry and protected from the wind. You can choose to wear a rain skirt, kilt or even a poncho.\nRAIN SKIRTS AND KILTS: ALL THE BENEFITS OF PANTS BUT NOT WINDPROOF\nThey wrap around your waist and cover your legs just like a skirt. These are easy to put on and take off. Unlike pants, you don’t even have to remove your boots. They also are very breathable minimizing sweat by allowing your legs to breathe while you hike. A skirt or kilt weighs about as much as a pair of pants and provides about as much protection from the rain. Wind is another story. Because they are very breathable, a kilt or skirt is not as effective in the wind as a pair of pants.\nPONCHO: PROTECTS BOTH TOP AND BOTTOM\nAnother option is a rain poncho which can replace both your rain jacket and your rain pants.

It’s slightly more difficult to remain stylish while looking like an extra from Frozen. From scarves to gloves to hats, these necessary accessories tend to cover the real fashion centrepieces hidden underneath.\nHowever, you can enjoy the best of both, and it is possible to stay warm while remaining stylishly sharp. Staying comfortable and warm is key during the winter months. When you’re cold, you’ll come across as uncomfortable, but it is possible to adapt your wardrobe accordingly by layering your clothes and selecting the correct winter-orientated fabrics. Wearing winter accessories and the right coat will help, as will choosing the correct footwear.\nIn summer, layering mainly results in sweating, but in winter, the different layers of clothes afford you the opportunity to get creative. Wearing several light layers can actually help retain your body heat better than just wearing one thick jumper.\nA winter outfit usually has at least three layers – a t-shirt, a shirt or sweaters, and a jacket or coat. Farah shirts worn underneath a jumper are versatile, and they will also ensure you look fashionable during winter. They can double up as both workwear pieces and shirts suitable for a night out and are available from stores such as EJ.\nWhat Are the Four Best Fabrics for Winter?\nAccording to GQ, a good-quality knitted hat is your best friend in the winter months, and it can add additional style to a winter outfit.\nChoosing clothes made from the right fabrics is key to staying warm. Cotton is ideal for a base or middle layer as it’s absorbent, which reduces sweat. Denim is perfect for a middle or top layer in the form of a jacket, while wool is best used for middle or top layers. Wool is undoubtedly one of the preferred fabrics thanks to its ability to keep us warm. A thin wool jumper will help keep you snug, as opposed to a thick layer of other material. Leather jackets are best for the top layer and will protect you from the biting wind.\nAnother rule is that you should never wear so many layers that your movement is restricted.", "score": 0.824474633, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:eac01bb8-9e6e-47cd-8e01-bb69abe692f1>", "text": "Welcome The Cooler Months\nby: Leesa Kotis on\nThree good reasons to get organised during the upcoming cooler months.\n1.

Learn about some of the best clothes for working outside in winter.\nTaking Stock of Your Work Environment\nProtecting your workers from freezing temperatures and winter storms all starts with getting to know your workers and your workplace. Outdoor workers, such as construction crews, snowplow operators, clean-up crews, and forest workers, can easily suffer from what’s known as cold stress when working in extreme temperatures. Cold stress occurs when the body can no longer warm itself, which can lead to cold-related illnesses, permanent tissue damage, trench foot, frostbite, hypothermia, and even death.\nBe aware of the wind chill temperature when working outdoors. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio will send out an alert if wind chill temperatures become potentially hazardous. You should also monitor your workers as they complete different tasks. This will give you a better idea as to what kinds of equipment and outdoor winter work clothes are best for the task at hand. For example, if your workers need to use their hands when working outdoors, look for insulated outdoor work gloves that retain a firm wet and dry grip.\nWinter Clothes for Working Outdoors\nOnce you have a better idea of what kinds of hazards you and your team are working with, you can start investing in a set of reliable outdoor work clothes that will keep you warm on the job, even under the most extreme circumstances.\nHere at PK Safety, we have everything you need to do your job during winter storms. That’s why we created GRIT, a private line of flame-retardant clothing (some insulated) for those that need to work outdoors and other winter activity enthusiasts.\nWhen working outdoors, use the MCR Safety Ninja Ice Glove.

Diego Velázquez uses linear perspective, tone and overlapping shapes in order to create the feelings of depth in the painting. The use of light also helps to highlight the different focal points of the picture as well as adding defintion to the subjects.\n'Las Meninas' was originally referred to as 'La Familia' in the Royal Court inventories. The painting has survived over the years, mostly thanks to the efforts of many restorers.

It is a perfect way for both beginning colorists and more advanced artists to create truly stunning coloring pieces. Grayscale coloring for adults is one of the newest and most exciting trends in adult coloring and is gaining popularity fast, and with good reason. People are drawn to grayscale coloring because it is fun It also results in very realistic pictures that can rival gallery-quality art. Grayscale images are created from specially selected photographs, paintings, and drawings. They are then converted to images for coloring using specialized graphic design software and hand-tuned to create the perfect shading and highlights for coloring.\nCategories: autumn coloring book, grayscale coloring book, fall grayscale coloring, autumn adult coloring book", "score": 0.828828633, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:9e6b1d52-f94c-4c50-b980-31d4c8b87cde>", "text": "Share autumn leaves clipart with you friends!\nOn this page you can download free autumn leaves clipart.

Diego Velazquez\nDiego Velazquez is nowadays considered to be the most important Spanish Baroque painter. Although he was already incredibly successful during his lifetime, he was truly appreciated centuries later in the 19th century due to his artistic style which was clearly ahead of his time. His approach in painting was individualistic and in contrast with the traditional styles of depiction from his contemporary period.\nHis naturalistic style, which later directly influenced the arising styles of impressionism and realism, focused on depicting scenes authentically and accurately which was uncommon for artists from this and any previous periods in Art.\nAlthough Velazquez was easily the most important figure in the court of King Philip IV and spent his life painting for royalties, he was deeply interested in the life of the common man and painted a large number of everyday scenes involving the common people, as in his famous Las Meninas. In fact, unlike most of his contemporaries, he was interested in all the genres of painting treated each with excellence which is why no other Spanish Baroque painter could compare to his genius.", "score": 0.0022936261827198406, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:7db54514-8ea1-475e-9d36-26bb1645002f>", "text": "Las Meninas was painted in 1656 by Diego Velázquez and is considered to be one of the best and most intriguing paintings of this era. The painting's composition is highly elaborate and challenges the perceptions of illusion and reality as well as the status and involvement of the subjects and the audience.\nThe painting's setting is Velázquez's studio in the Royal Palace in Madrid. At the time of painting 'Las Meninas', Velázquez had been working for the Spanish Royal Court for over thirty years. He was a highly respected artist by the Royal Family and he often painted pictures of the family members. However 'Las Meninas' was much more unconventional than his other paintings.\nThe foreground of the painting contains the one of the main focuses of the paintings, the Infanta Margarita, a five year old princess who was the daughter of the Spanish King, Philip IV and his wife, Mariana. The princess is being waited on by two ladies in waiting or maids. To the right hand side of the princess stand two dwarves and a dog. Behind them you can find Margarita's chaperone and a bodyguard.\nVelázquez himself is painted in the left hand side of the painting, painting at an easel. A set of keys is hanging from Diego's belt, showing that he was important enough to merit keys to the Court and its offices. The red cross that is situated on his chest, which signifies that he was a member of the Order of Santiago, was added to the painting later, some say by the King himself.\nIn the background of the painting there are yet more figures of interest. The man stood in the doorway is Don José Nieto Velázquez who was at the time the Spanish queen's chamberlain. He is depicted stood on the stairs although it is not known whether he is entering or leaving the scene.\nThere is a mirror situated on the back wall of Velázquez's studio which is showing the reflection of two figures, which have been identified by art historians at the Spanish King and Queen from comparisons with other Velázquez paintings. It is thought therefore that these are the subject of the work that Velázquez is painting in 'Las Meninas'.\nIt is clear that, as there is so much going on in the painting, that it is unclear as to whom or what the real subject is.", "score": 0.0011328358051122971, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:feaa3ce6-da41-4f57-ad99-aa4e5417da9f>", "text": "There was a very quiet revolution at the Prado in 2013, when the museum rehung the galleries of paintings by Diego Velázquez (1599–1660), making his psychological masterpiece, Las Meninas, the sun at the center of its artistic solar system. They placed it among his royal portraits directly opposite the entry door of Sala 12 on the second level of the Villanueva building. You have probably seen reproductions of this portrait of Felipe IV’s royal family (with a shadowy portrait of the painter himself) a thousand times, but the sheer scope and power of the actual canvas will bowl you over. The focus of the painting is on the young infanta Margarita (daughter of Felipe IV) and her diminutive ladies in waiting, including one of the many royal dwarves whom Velázquez never tired of painting. Las Meninas is easily the most popular painting in the Prado. (Before you leave, stop by the bookstore in the modern addition by Rafael Moneo to pick up a postcard of the painting. If you visit Barcelona, you’ll want a copy to compare to Picasso’s homage in the Museu Picasso.) If you want to see Las Meninas without crowds, be among the first to enter in the morning—a Madrid Card, Paseo del Arte pass, or printout of an online ticket purchase lets you skip the line.\nEven before the rearrangement, there was a logic to gravitating first to Velázquez. Felipe VI ordered the creation of the Prado in 1819 to consolidate the royal art collections (hence all those portraits of Spanish kings and their families), and to prove to the rest of Europe that Spanish art was the equal of any other nation. He was right, and while the Prado has some priceless works by Fra Angelico, Titian, Rembrandt, and Hieronymus Bosch, the Spaniards dominate the collection, and we can’t think of a better place to see their work. No matter what else interests you, we suggest focusing first on Velázquez and then turning your attention to Francisco de Goya.\nFrom 1623 until his death in 1660, Velázquez was court painter to Felipe IV, a king only a few years his junior.", "score": 0.0007809150163763027, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:47d8af4f-1d08-47e3-a4ba-dfa995265229>", "text": "To the right of the mirror, on a flight of steps leading up to a doorway and a brightly lit adjoining room, stands Jose Nieto, the queen's palace marshal.\nThere are several basic questions that have been asked again and again about this picture. What is Velázquez painting on the front of the canvas that is hidden from us? Where did he stand in order to paint the scene and himself in it? What is the source of the image in the mirror - that is, just where in the room must the royal couple have been standing for their reflection to appear? And finally, is there any significance in the fact that the red cross of the Order of Santiago is prominently applied to the artist's clothing?\nIt was long thought that Velázquez was creating a picture without any metaphysical or speculative reference, and was merely recording a fleeting moment in permanent form, as if in a snapshot. According to this theory the subject was no more than an ordinary scene of palace life.\nA different hypothesis is put forward by art historians, who believe that intellect and keen perspicacity, as well as the artist's eye and hand, were involved in the painting of Las Meninas. The largest number of interpretations have been put forward for the mirror on the back wall, sometimes also thought to be a painted canvas. Much learned industry has also been applied to the question of location: in which room in the palace is this scene taking place?\nDespite the riddles hidden in the painting of Las Meninas we must not overlook its artistic mastery, particularly as expressed in the figure of the Infanta Margarita surrounded by people of lesser birth. For it was on the princess that the dynastic hopes of the Spanish Habsburgs rested after the death of Prince Baltasar Carlos.", "score": 0.0004038309420299386, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:60dd3647-d87e-497a-9776-b513626757e2>", "text": "You are here:\nNews & Events\nFrom Non Satis Scire, The Hampshire College Alumni Magazine, Summer 2017\nMequitta Ahuja 96S\nIn this photograph I’m standing in my studio, a room downstairs in our house. I constructed this image as source material for a painting not yet made, and which began with me thinking about Velázquez’s Las Meninas.\nEnigmatic, Velázquez’s painting depicts members of the Spanish court of King Philip IV and has compelled generations of artists for many reasons — one of which is the complex use of space as a narrative device, withholding and revealing critical information. For example, the way those most central Renaissance figures, king and queen, are posed just beyond the picture, revealed in a mirror.\nLas Meninas has me thinking about paintings within paintings, depicted space versus actual space. My interest is also on the princess. Although she is visually centered, many argue that the painting is as much a portrait of Velázquez himself, the master of representation. In Picasso’s many riffs on Las Meninas, he focuses on the artist, whom he presents as king. But I’m thinking about the princess and how she might be cast as artist.\nWith that in mind, I position myself centrally in royal blue, posed as both model and artist simultaneously. The cascading fabric beneath my raised foot makes a pyramid of my stance. I’m surrounded by my paintings, their maker presented to acknowledge my viewers, not actively painting. Posed commandingly in my blue jogging suit, brush in hand and plastic painting gloves, I’m a parody mashup of the artist as worker and the art model as icon of beauty. The two paintings to my left are closely related to each other. The smaller one in front partially obscures the larger one, but it depicts the underlying structure of the figurative painting behind it.\nI, too, aim for mastery. I want to understand deeply the inner workings of pictures. Studying the history of art, I constantly discover painting in its diverse conceptions across time and geography. I get obsessed with little things, like Goya’s calling card clutched in a magpie’s beak and Zurbarán’s cartellino on a painting of the crucifixion.", "score": 7.296744115353786e-05, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:59dc7e43-7bdc-49df-a342-0a1046d1929c>", "text": "The composition presents a grim scene where skeletal figures, representing death, triumph over humanity.

Created by Diego Velázquez, this masterpiece is considered one of the most significant works in Western art history. The painting portrays the Spanish royal family, with a focus on Infanta Margarita, surrounded by maids, courtiers, and even Velázquez himself. Through his masterful use of composition, light, and perspective, Velázquez captures a complex scene that blurs the boundaries between reality and illusion. \"Las Meninas\" is a testament to Velázquez's artistic genius and his ability to convey depth and human emotion.\nMust Read: Mint Museum\n\"Saturn Devouring His Son\" is a chilling and powerful painting that is part of the \"Black Paintings\" series displayed at the Museo Nacional del Prado in Madrid, Spain. Painted by Francisco Goya, this dark and disturbing artwork depicts the mythological god Saturn in a frenzied act of cannibalism, devouring one of his own children.

The actual size of the painting is 3,18 x 2,76 meters (more like a 4:3 format than a 3:2 format, whereas thegolden ratiois 3.2:2). Velázquez himself is included in the painting, looking at us, connecting us to the scene, bringing us to it. He also included other spectators placed outside of the scene, just in the place in which we are! In the centre of the scene we can see a mirror, and a couple reflected on it is looking at the scene. They seem to be the King Felipe IV and his wife, the Queen Mariana de Austria. They are not in our world, they are in Velázquez’s world (place, time), in front (and outside) of the scene, interacting with it (looking at it) from the place (and perspective) in which we are. We also can see a figure in a door (don José Nieto de Velázquez, quartemaster of the Queen. Is he leaving or coming?). He is looking to the scene from the back, and he is out of focus! The door connects the hall (probably in the Alcázar of Madrid, now disappeared and replaced by the actual Royal Palace, built in the XVIII century) with the exterior, where the sun shines, bringing light to the darker interior. All this conform the accessory elements of the painting. The central characters are interacting among them at the centre, in the foreground. The Infanta Margarita is just in the middle, accompanied by “Las Meninas” or “Escorts” (Isabel Velasco and Agustina Sarmiento), two dwarfs (María Bárbola and Nicolás Pertusato, playing with a dog) and behind them two more people (Marcela de Ulloa and an unidentified gentleman).

The first flash mobs were organized in Manhattan by the editor of Harper’s Magazine, Bill Wasik.

His second attempt was much more successful, and a group of about 130 people descended on a Macy’s department store. The group met in the rug department, and were instructed to tell sales associates that they all lived in a warehouse in the industrial district, and were in the market for a ‘love rug.’ Of course, the story went that the members of this made up community couldn’t make a decision without everyone else’s input. Sounds like a fun time!\nPlenty of people have organized their own flash mobs since then, and the one in the video above has got to be my favorite.

These are our favourite as you can swim in the open air, the water is a pleasant temperature and there are usually lots of areas to relax by the water. Some of our favourite open cenotes are Cenote Azul, Cenote Zacil-Ha and Car Wash Cenote.\n- Semi-open cenotes: these cenotes are mostly underground but have small openings in the ceiling where light and fresh air come in. These cenotes can be particularly beautiful as the light beams illuminate the crystal clear water below.

Visit one of the Seven Wonders of the World Chichen Itza\nAlthough Chichen Itza is a popular and touristy spot, it is still a must-see and one of Mexico´s best tourist attractions. The Mayan temples are absolutely striking. If you’re like me and want to avoid crowds, you can do an evening tour (I went with Amigo Tours on their Chichen Itza Day and Night tour) — they have licenses to go into the site after closing, so you’re only there with a group of 20, instead of in a crowd of thousands.\n2. Swim in a Cenote\nBest Cenotes in Mexico\nCenotes are these magical, underground swimming pools created by Mother Nature. Some are open at the top and some are more closed, like a cave. Most are located within the Yucatan Peninsula.\nIk Kil is a popular one, mainly because it is near Chichen Itza, but it is also STUNNING, with vines and tree roots stretching down hundreds of feet towards the water. The key is to get there early to avoid crowds. There are several other cenotes that are lesser known and great to check out, each unique in its own way.\nCenote Zaci is lovely, and is in the center of the colonial city Valladolid. It is also best to go in the morning because locals come to cool off midafternoon and it can get more crowded. Cenotes by area: Valladolid (Zaci, Samula, Xkeken and Xcanche), Playa del Carmen (Azul, Jardin Eden and Cristalino), Puerto Morelos (Verde Lucero and La Noria), and Merida (Xlacah, and “the 3 cenotes of Cuzama”). Ik Kil is central to all of these locations, being a long drive of about 1 1/2-2 hours, regardless of which area you stay in, so it is best paired with a visit to Chichen Itza.", "score": 0.033328135195148996, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:432cd899-4938-4986-a976-d1acfa7a3805>", "text": "|4th of January 2002 (Fri)||#1|\nJoin Date: Nov 2001\nComments on trip to Vegas\nHappy belated New Year to everyone.\nThese were taken from my 3 days trip to Vegas before the New Year.\nCanon EF 50mm f1.4\nCanon EF 70-200IS f2.8\n+ Cheapo Tripod\nQuestion to those experienced in night scenic and people shots:\nWhenever I use the flash for people shot, my background (building lightings) turn more yellow.\nSee #103 vs 104 or 105 vs 106.\nIn both situations I used the same aperature and shutter speed settings. the only difference is the flash off and then flash on for people.\nHow to get the correct color of the background while using flash with night shots?\nThanks a bunch.\n|4th of January 2002 (Fri)||#2|\nJoin Date: Jul 2001\nRe: Comments on trip to Vegas\nMeter your background ONLY and set your camera to that.

Experiment a lot with this and you will get something nice. May have to set flash to High speed sync depending on the background brightness. Diffuse flash so skin tones are not blown out.

It was recognized and practiced as far back as the fourth dynasty. Ancient Egyptians believed that magick emanated from the Gods. They believed that it was those supernatural beings they revered who were responsible for endowing them with magickal powers and wisdom.\nOut of this belief they focused on trying to command their Gods to do their bidding and appear at desire. Egyptians attempted to make this a possibility by using talismans made of papyrus or stones with magickal words inscribed on them, which they carried, thus earning the reputation of being a ‘nation of magicians’.\nThe Egyptians’ faith in magick was so powerful, it was invoked in all questions of life, death, love, hatred, health and disease. Due to this it intermingled with both religion and medicine, whereby all priests and healers practiced it. The Egyptians believed that illness was caused by the possession of one’s body by an evil spirit, the cure of which was an exorcism. The priest or healer would diagnose the illness and find the matching name of the demon and then work on expelling it. Another method of healing was ‘incubation sleep’. A patient would sleep in a temple and wait for dreams believed to be induced by the Gods. Upon waking the dream is interpreted by the priest-magician and ‘messages’ in the dream should have fulfilled their purpose of healing.\nAncient Egyptians practiced their magick at any time, unless a spell specified otherwise. The one essential rule was that the practitioner must always face the east when in ritual. Perfume and incense were very important elements of any ritual. Perfumed oils were of utmost importance in embalment, as perfume was believed to possess the power of making members of the body perfect.\nImages and figures were widely used in Egyptian magick.

Evil is removed by good. Hence when the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) was asked about al-nushrah (treating sihr with sihr), he said: “This is the work of the Shaytaan.” Nushrah means removing sihr from a person who has been affected by it by using more sihr. But if it is treated by means of the Qur’aan and permissible medicines or good ruqyahs, there is nothing wrong with that, but treating it with sihr is not permitted, as previously stated, because sihr means worshipping the shayaateen (devils). The saahir (magician, practitioner of witchcraft) does sihr or learns sihr only after worshipping and serving the shayaateen, and drawing close to them by means of the things that they like. After that, they teach him the means of sihr. But, praise be to Allaah, there is no reason why the person who has been affected by sihr should not be treated by means of reciting Qur’aan and the prayers for refuge with Allaah that are prescribed in sharee’ah, and permissible medicines, just as patients with all kinds of sicknesses are treated by doctors. The patient does not necessarily recover, because not every sick person does recover. A sick patient might be treated and then recover if his appointed time (of death) has not yet arrived, or he may not recover and may die from this sickness, even though he may be been seen by the most skilled physicians and knowledgeable doctors. When the appointed time of death comes, no medicine or treatment will be of any avail, because Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n“And Allaah grants respite to none when his appointed time (death) comes”\nMedical treatment is of benefit when the appointed time has not yet come, and Allaah decrees that His slave should be healed.", "score": 0.817125857, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:64db53a2-8f68-41a6-9929-1601748b1a87>", "text": "Maybe I just don’t have the right \"Book of Djinn\", and that's probably the case in reality.

These lands might be leased out to tenant farmers, who would pay a percentage of the increase to the temple as a form of rent on the land.\nThese economic activities required a system of bookkeeping, and the ancient Sumerians developed a rather impressive system of accounting. Many inscriptions recovered from the Ur III period (ca. 2100–2000 BC) are actually economic texts listing transactions involving animals, produce from farmland, and even banking records of deposits and withdrawals from \"silver\" accounts.23\nSumerian Temples and Creation\nOf the various rituals that took place in Mesopotamian temples, perhaps the best-known was the creation ritual associated with the beginning of the new year. In later times, the Babylonians would recite a creation myth known by its incipit as the Enuma Elish.24 But it is very likely that something of the sort already existed in Sumerian times. Creation motifs appear in numerous texts that may have been associated with temple rituals.25 For example, the Sumerian story of Enki and Ninmah deals with the creation of mankind. In it, the goddess Nammu asks her son, Enki, to create man to do the work of the gods, who are complaining of their work loads (the usual reason for creating man, according to Mesopotamian tradition). Enki instructs Nammu on how to pinch off clay above the abzu and create man. During a feast that ensues, Ninmah (Nammu's assistant) gets drunk and tries to create men, but since she is drunk, all her creations are defective. The account then lists the various defects.\nIn any case, the Mesopotamian creation accounts differ from the biblical account in the relationship of man to deity. In Mesopotamia man is the slave of the gods, not the offspring of deity as in our own tradition. One notable exception to that is a bilingual story of the creation by the chief Babylonian god, Marduk, in which man is the offspring of the gods. Because of this unusual twist, it is worth reproducing here in toto.26\nCT 13, PLATES 35–37\nWe note here that Marduk creates a city (Babylon) even before he creates man, and then he creates the animals after creating man.", "score": 1.2363290214808094e-09, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:79aebff0-6e4e-405f-9f86-e4e03dcac4e5>", "text": "Gardner desired to, but was kept from publicly writing about the survival of Witchcraft, because at the time Witchcraft was still against English law. So his novel High Magic’s Aidconcerning Witchcraft was published in 1949, under the pseudonym Scire. The work included rituals which he had learned from his coven, and the worship of the Horned God, but the Goddess was not mentioned.\nWhen the law against witchcraft was repealed in 1951 Gardner broke from the New Forest coven to form his own coven. In the same year he traveled to the Isle of Man, on which was a Museum of Magic and Witchcraft which had been established by Cecil Williamson and housed in a 400-year-old Craft farmhouse. Williamson had originally named it the Folklore Centre and intended it to become a center for currently practicing Witches. Gardner became the “resident Witch” and added his personal substantial collection of ritual tools and artifacts. Gardner purchased the museum from Williamson.\nIt was in 1953 that Gardner initiated Doreen Valiente into his coven. The coven’s rituals were virtually identical to those that Gardner described in High Magic’s Aid. In his coven Gardner reworked his material since the material which he inherited from his first coven was only fragmentary. He freshen rituals with his own work, adding quotations and extracts from Crowley’s work. Valiente somewhat discouraged this, advising Gardner that Growley’s material was inappropriate because it was “too modern,” thus most of Crowley’s work was subsequently deleted through rewriting of the material. Gardner and Valiente collaborated through the years of 1954 to 1957 on writing ritual and nonritual material. The body or work, or Book of Shadows, became the authority for what is currently known as the Gardnerian tradition.\nIn 1954 Gardener published his first nonfiction book about Witchcraft, Witchcraft Today. The book supports the theory of the British anthropologist Margaret A. Murray, that modern Witchcraft is the surviving remnant of organized Pagan religion which existed during the witch hunts.

So how can we mix two of our loves: renewable energy and historic preservation?\nTo start, it helps to understand why new roofs are the best roofs for solar. Roofs, like any part of a building, need routine maintenance over their lifetime and a roof has about the same average lifespan as a solar system; 20-25 years. So to ensure you won’t incur added costs for the dismantle and reinstallation of a solar system for that routine roof maintenance we always recommend starting with a new roof, or planning on a little renovation as part of your installation process.\nThat means, often the best time for an office or home to incorporate renewable energy is during their routine renovations or modernizations.

We’ll also discuss the benefits and disadvantages of solar energy. By the end of this post, you should have a good understanding of what solar systems are and how they work. Have fun!\nPassive solar systems are an increasingly popular form of renewable energy source that make use of the sun’s energy to generate electricity for homes and businesses. The system works by using the sunlight to generate heat, which is then converted into electricity via a photovoltaic cell. This makes it an efficient and cost-effective way of powering your home, as well as being environmentally friendly.\nA passive solar system typically includes several components, such as a collection unit to collect the sunlight and convert it into heat, a storage unit where the energy is stored and then converted into electricity, and an inverter that can convert the electricity from DC to AC power. In addition, some systems will also include thermal mass materials like concrete or bricks which help absorb excess heat during the day, and release it at night when temperatures drop.\nThe advantages of using a passive solar system over traditional sources of energy are numerous. Firstly, they are much more efficient than other forms of renewable energy sources like wind or hydroelectricity because they directly utilize the sun’s rays rather than relying on external forces like wind or flowing water. Secondly, they are significantly less expensive to install than traditional generators since there is no need for expensive equipment such as turbines or other complicated machinery. Finally, since there is no need for fuel sources such as coal or natural gas, passive solar systems can be completely emissions-free, making them a great choice for homes looking to reduce their environmental impact.\nIn order to properly utilize passive solar systems in your home or business setting, certain measures should be taken in order to maximize efficiency and take advantage of available sunlight throughout the day. For example, it’s important to orient your collection units towards the south so that they receive maximum exposure throughout the day; windows should also be placed in strategic locations in order to capture additional light. Additionally, walls with thermal mass can help absorb excess heat during hot summer days and release it during chilly winter nights; this helps ensure that you get optimal performance from your system year round without needing any additional heating or cooling supplies.", "score": 0.851260066, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:15328d89-bf02-4144-a9ce-40b50baff004>", "text": "Home building.. with a difference?\nI would strong urge people considering building their own house to use SIPs panels and heat recvoery ventilation.

Your local council will offer advice on planning permission requirements if your home reside in a conservation area, have a flat roof or have a listed building.\n- Will installing solar panels affect the market value of my house? - As stated by the Homeowners Association, it has been found that negative and positive adjustments have occurred in the past on account of solar power installations on properties. As understanding grows about environment and climate changes, it has been seen that the positive effects on property prices have increased.\nTHE BENEFITS OF SOLAR\nLow Carbon Footprint - Any kind of solar panel installations you're considering, PV or thermal, will generate renewable, green energy for your home. There are no carbon emissions, no pollutants and you can prevent almost 2 tonnes of carbon from damaging the atmosphere each year.\nMaintenance Free - What makes solar panels in Southend-on-Sea even more appealing is the very little maintenance required over their life span. Aside from occasional cleaning, the panels can be left unattended and should carry on working for 25 years or more. If your solar panel system has batteries attached for storage, these must be changed every few years, however as this technology is continuously improving, efficiency and battery life is getting better every year.\nExtra Income - If your solar installation generates more electricity than you use, you can sell this back to your energy provider through the SEG (Smart Export Guarantee) scheme. This could be in the form of cash payments or as credit added to your electricity bill every three months.

Indeed, they can be placed very near one another in a narrow stance or they can be placed far from each other in a wide stance. Choosing which stance applies to what circumstances is detailed below.\nA normal – or default – stance is one that sees the distance between your feet match the width of your shoulders. Technically and to be more precise, the outside of your shoulders should line up with the middle of your feet in order for such a stance to be considered normal.\nBecause this is the default athletic position in golf in can be used for most ‘normal’ shots. Erring away from that position is done in order to achieve specific objectives or because specific situations require it. Those situations are detailed below.\nIn order to assume a wider stance you will need to position your feet further away from each other that you normally would. Specifically, a good wide stance sees the outside of your shoulders line up with the inside of your feet.\nAdopting a wider stance lowers your center of gravity slightly, allowing you to become more stable on your feet as you address the club on the ground and as you execute your swing. This gain in stability is particularly helpful in very windy days, allowing you to confidently go about your swing without fear of falling off balance. It is also helpful whenever your feet are on a sidehill, again helping you maintain balance. More generally, it is recommended to adopt a wide stance whenever you are using longer clubs that demand wide and full swings. Specifically. drivers, fairway woods are best used with a wider than normal stance.\nAnother effect of lowering your center of gravity is that it tends to lower the bottom of the swing arc. This in turn can lead to greater odds of hitting fat shots – where the club penetrates the ground before making impact with the ball. As a result it is generally best to avoid using a wider stance for delicate shots using short irons and wedges on grass. However, a swing arc that favours hitting it fat is exactly what is sought for greenside bunker shots, where the club is meant to travel below the ball and push the sand up.\nFinally, a wide stance can also inhibit hip and shoulder rotation or at least it can make those movements slightly uncomfortable.", "score": 0.9970784946101872, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:f14942bc-5af1-470c-8993-ce7e0cb2f529>", "text": "What does “Alignment” mean and how is it different from “Aim?”\nThe question may seem too simple. Alignment deals with the shoulders, hips, knees and feet. We want these four body parts all in “alignment” so they are all pointing in the same direction. Pointing them in the same direction is “aiming.” A person can have good alignment and not be aimed at the target. Also, because of wind factor or slope angle, you may need to aim somewhere other than the flag or the green.\nMost amateurs don’t recognize the full effect of alignment and aim. Proper alignment is absolutely essential to a proper swing. Some swing faults can be attributed to poor alignment.\nIn many ways, aim is just as critical. Aim deals with a perception. Therefore, you judge your ball flight by where you perceive you are aimed. If your aim is off target, you will adjust your swing for what you think is a swing flaw, when it is actually an aiming mistake.\nAim and alignment are also a lot more difficult than most players realize. The task is subject to mis-perceptions caused by several factors:\n(a) The target is 90 degrees from the direction your body faces. This means you must be able to set both the club face and your body in a line perpendicular with the target line. It sounds easier than it is; most players are completely unaware when their line is off. Players will often begin the day with good aim and alignment and then unwittingly slip into misdirection as the round progresses…or in this case, regresses.\n(b) When you are addressing the ball, looking down the target line, it may appear that the desired hitting direction has changed slightly.\n(c) Sometimes you must hit from a slope, forcing you to adjust aim, alignment and setup.\n(d) The terrain and obstacles in your target path affect your perception of target direction.\n(e) It’s easy to forget how important it is to properly aim. Without a diligent and consistent pre-shot routine, you will tend to become less aware of the steps you are taking to aim. This is a big mistake.\nIt takes practice to manage each situation presented by the golf course. Golfers are highly susceptible to faults even in situations with no added challenges.

The baseline hypothesis is that linemen need superior decision making skills: quick judgments about blitzes, better memory of the intricacies of the plays and blocking schemes, etc. But this seems hard to swallow: doesn’t the running back need those exact skills? And why does the punter, whose job seems pretty one-off. And the operation of this idea is weird, however popular it might be: the idea seems to be that there’s an undifferentiated mass of football players in pop-warner leagues. Some are smarter than others. The smarter ones get pushed to the o-line and the QB position; the less smart ones are pushed to become little wide-receivers. Then, what happens? In a feat of unprecedented lamarckian adaptation, the little o-linemen become huge o-linemen; the little wide receivers become lithe, tall, or very, very fast.\nOr maybe the selection operates over time in a different way: dumb o-linemen, notwithstanding their physical characteristics, are selected out of the football tournament; wide-receivers are encouraged to be stupid. You might have thought football was a game about bashing the other guy, being a freakish physical specimen, and being willing to sacrifice your body and brain for the team. On this hypothesis, it isn’t: it’s a selection process for decisionmaking skills. Look, I guess this is possible, but it seems quite unlikely\nSo I don’t understand the selection story. And that makes me doubt whether the Wonderlic test measures anything of relevance to football, as opposed to a particular kind of test taking skill which might result in a persistent bias in scores based on position.

The teams that continue to rely on the test appear, to me, to be seeking empirical justification for some kind of gut decision making about character.\nWith respect to bias, start first with the observation that offensive linemen are disproportionately white in a league that is mostly (70% or so) composed of African-American players.

In most cases these varying lengths also require a change in the player’s stance.\nSo if you have 8 or 9 variable length irons, you have 8 or 9 setups and 8 or 9 swingplanes to imagine.\nAnother point is that there are no real rules on ball positioning setup. Note that some exceptional players like Hogan and Nicklaus, as shown below, use alternative setups they found more productive. It goes to show that even great ball strikers attempt to simplify their stances by reducing the number of setup combinations. Others, like Seve Ballesteros, have no set rules for positioning and instead let their comfort level determine the setup. Now THAT takes real conditioning.\nUnfortunately, hybrid irons don’t successfully resolve this problem. Whether you are using a complete set of Wilson TurfRiders or for lower irons only, today’s du jure solution, the hybrids each have a different length and therefore require a different setup.\nMultiple setups are a major complication to the variable length iron game and intuitively a key reason that the iron game continues to be such a mess for the average golfer.\nEven with perfectly matched multiple length irons that each feel about the same when swinging them, a decision still must be made on every iron shot as to setup and ball positioning. If you setup 31” away when your best striking zone is at 30”, you don’t need much science to realize that is a problem for shot execution. Even the robot isn’t going to strike consistent shots 1” offcenter.\nAnd it’s not hard to relate to the problem with your own personal experiment. Taking a friend with you to the driving range, hit a dozen 5 irons recording the toeline-ball distance and shot performance. You will soon discover that it is quite challenging to consistently set the right ball address distance from shot to shot. You will also note that when you are properly set, shot results are better.\nOne last point regarding the basic setup problem with multiple length irons. After you have painstakingly perfected your setup for each iron, you also need to have the toeline aligned properly to the target.

Three times more likely, in fact.\nWhat does this mean? It means that the most common problem a player will face with their vision is not being able to judge where exactly the ball is despite being able to see it clearly.\nThe solution given by others is often simply more practice — which only leads to practice compensations, not improvement in performance. Ultimately the failure to identify and correct the visual problem at the source of the problem leads to continued variable spoting performance and a lack of confidence.\nOnce confidence is affected, the road back is a long one, when it could have been easily corrected if appropriate vision testing was performed early in a player’s career.\nWhat if we told you that “Watch the ball!” is wrong?\nWhether it is the way that instructions are given, or a general misperception of vision, we believe it is time to stop using this phrase for experienced officials and sportspeople. The ball isn’t the answer, but rather the contact zone — you need to be able to anticipate where the ball is heading and look into that zone. If you try too hard to “look at the ball”, your eyes will remain there, i.e. where it was, and as the ball moves you spend your time trying to “catch up to the ball” meaning you are behind the ball and too late. In our years of working with elite sportspeople, whether it is Rugby League, AFL, Cricket and even Netball, we have found that those who are having handling difficulties or form slumps are indeed trying to watch the ball! What else would they be doing? However in trying hard to do so, their eyes get stuck where the ‘was’ and don’t move to where the ball is going. This leads to them trying to catch or hit the ball using their peripheral vision, increasing the chance of error.\nFor example, a Rugby League player shouldn’t worry so much about seeing the ball in the dummy-half’s hands but rather he needs to see the ball in the space he is running to. i.e. as soon as the dummy-half releases the pass, the player needs to direct his eyes and attention to the space the ball is being passed to.", "score": 0.838412225, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:38808dea-5260-42ad-985b-1e5e0d1efc7b>", "text": "For those who play the ball as it lies instead of teeing it up on a clump through-the-green, there isn’t much advantage in striking a 4 iron or equivalent hybrid.\nOne thing we know for sure based on average golfer scores for the past 3 or 4 decades, the existing technologies haven’t done much, if anything, to improve average golfer performance because new equipment designs are made for the best in the game, not the worst. And irons are the biggest culprit ..\nMaybe it’s time for the average player to break with tradition ..\nIron game improvement for the average golfer\nPossibly the best ‘iron’ ball striker of all time, Ben Hogan, once said “there are as many positions for the feet as there are clubs in the bag “.\nThis is illustrated below from the Encyclopedia of Golf Techniques, Paul Foston, first edition 1989.\nThere are 3 complications to proper setup with variable length clubs.\nFirst, the distance from the toeline to the ball changes with each length of club. Think in terms of swinging two sticks – one 3’ long and one 6’ long. Necessarily, to strike the ground with the 3’ stick requires that ground striking point to be close to your toeline. To strike the ground in a similar fashion with a 6’ stick, requires you stand much farther back from the ground strike point.\nSecond, for most golfers, the ball position is moved slightly ‘back’ in the stance for each variable length club. This is because the clubface must ‘square’ at point of impact for each club on a properly executed swing and, as the variable length clubs get shorter, it is easier to ‘square’ the impact moving the ball back. Otherwise, the player must uncomfortably ‘reach’ for the ball.\nThird, the golfer needs to mentally and physically combine the ‘distance away’ and ‘distance back’ for each club length in his bag. For 8 iron club lengths that means one needs to have 16 separate setups and that’s for the basic ‘flat ground’ shot.\nThis is further complicated by ‘how’ you position your feet assuming you carry a ruler with you to physically measure the precise ball positioning you need.

See It - The first step in an effective routine is to get behind the ball and visualize a positive outcome of the shot you are preparing to play. Fred Couples says, \" I visualize the best shot I have played with the club I have chosen.\" Jack Nicklaus said he visualized himself sitting in a movie theatre \"watching himself hit the proper shot.\"\n2. Feel It - You may or may not choose to take a practice swing or smaller motion during your routine. Both are effective. Make a conscious effort to feel the motion regardless.\n3. Physical Routine - Develop a consistent physical routine as you prepare to play the shot. This will include proper grip, stance and posture. Stance and posture includes assuring good alignment and proper ball position relative to the club and shot you are preparing to play. It's very important during this step of your pre-shot process to be as fluid and consistent as possible. If you focus on this properly, it will help your mind focus. You have already visualized a successful shot in Step 1, so \"trust\" that image.\n4. Acceptance - Regardless of the result, accept the outcome and move on to next shot. This is very important. All great players do this very well! Developing and sticking to a pre- and post-shot routine, regardless of how you are playing, is important to becoming the best golfer you can be!

There are two main competing philosophies regarding this.\nOne recommends to position the ball forward always while the other recommends to move the ball along a continuum in relation to the club at hand.\nBoth are explained below.\nBall Forward, Always\nBen Hogan, as well as Jack Nicklaus and Greg Norman (amongst others) advocate placing the ball forward in the stance always, no matter which club you are using.\nWhat will change instead is where you place your right foot and the general guideline here is the longer the club the furthest away that right foot will be located.\nOr in other words, the longer the club, the wider the stance and therefore the further back you should place your right foot.\nThe main argument to using this ball positioning scheme is that it promotes consistency. It does so because the ball is always located on the same spot relative to the left foot.\nThis consistency in ball location helps gain a certain level of confidence and allows the brain to concentrate on other areas of the golf swing.\nOn the flip side, because the ball is always forward in the stance it can lead to risks of mishits on its own.\nIndeed, positioning the ball forward can lead to fat shots – or skulled shots – if the bottom of the swing arc does not match this ball position.\nFor example, a swing arc that bottoms out before impact may work for drives that are meant to struck the ball on the way up but it will not work with wedges for example, which will produce chunk shots or even skulled shots.\nIn this instance, it is best suited to those that can and prefer to see impact happen forward in the stance.\nAlong a Continuum\nThe main alternative to placing the ball on the same line in relation to the left foot is to move the ball on a continuum from the left heel to the center of the stance.\nIndeed, this competing philosophy states that the ball should be in the center of the stance for wedges and short irons and be moved forward progressively as the club lengthens and the distance to the ball increases. Similarly, the longer the club, the wider the stance.\nThis is what is generally taught in golf lessons these days.\nThe main argument to using this scheme is that it differentiates between clubs that are meant to hit the ball on the way up and those that are meant to hit down on the ball.", "score": 0.0001117035823403704, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:44d877a8-a909-4fb3-a550-c1725c704851>", "text": "The key to solid alignment in your practice is convenience.

Walking is also help to keep you loose and warm.\nOne of the most important things you need to learn a golf swing is to how to incorporate a proper grip. Try to use a soft, yet firm.Hold the golf club as though you were cradling a bird.\nWhen putting the golf ball, it is important to have your hands slightly ahead of the line between your head and the ball. Maintain this position while you follow through with your swing.\nIf you’re faced with a long putt, pay special attention to the speed of your putt. This will give you the best chance of success for your putt is not too long or too short.\nKnowing how to keep score is a crucial element of playing golf. This can be helpful because your player ranking is based on your score. The intent is to do so in as little a number of strokes as you to get the ball into the hole.\nDuring any other swing, your ball should be centered between your feet as you swing your club. The only exception to this if you are playing your shot from a slope.\nBe certain you are using appropriate posture to maximize the impact of your golf swing. The position you are in usually dictates the golf ball travels. The ball will not travel very far if you slouch too much or too little.\nStand a few feet behind your golf ball and locate where you’re going to send it prior to addressing it. Take time to incorporate variables for wind direction and other weather-related factors. Taking just a few minutes thinking about the shot will help you properly align the best direction and alignment.

Similarly to microscope AI, performance competitiveness is perhaps one of the biggest sticking points with regards to STEM AI, as being confined solely to STEM problems has the major potential to massively limit the applicability of an advanced AI system. That being said, many purely STEM problems such as protein folding or nanotechnology development have the potential to provide huge economic boons that could easily surpass those from any other form of advanced AI as well as solve major societal problems such as curing major illnesses. Thus, if the answer to the reason that you want to build advanced AI in the first place is to get such benefits, then STEM AI might be a perfectly acceptable substitute from a performance competitiveness standpoint. Furthermore, such boons could lead to a decisive strategic advantage that could enable heavy investment in aligning other forms of advanced AI which are more performance competitive.\nThat being said, if one of the major use cases for your first advanced AI is helping to build your second advanced AI, STEM AI fails hard on that metric, as it advances our technology without also advancing our understanding of alignment. In particular, unlike every other approach on this list, because STEM AI is confined solely to STEM, it can’t be used to do alignment work. Thus, STEM AI could potentially create a vulnerable world situation where the powerful technology produced using the STEM AI makes it much easier to build advanced AI systems without also making it more likely that they will be aligned. This problem could potentially be mitigated if the STEM AI were heavily focused on applications that could potentially assist with alignment such as whole brain emulation, though to what extent that would actually be possible or actually help with alignment is quite unclear.\n7. Narrow reward modeling + transparency tools\nThe approach here is as follows:\n- For some particular problem/domain/environment, jointly train a reward model using human feedback and an agent that pursues that reward. Specifically, we can use an approach like that described in DeepMind Safety’s “Scalable agent alignment via reward modeling” where human feedback on agent trajectories can be used to refine the reward model, as seen below.", "score": 1.4363363692968277e-05, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:a28d009c-b2b7-4780-9aed-836b57cccfa6>", "text": "The other aspect that has to be examined is the stance that elite powerlifters use. In a study examining the biomechanics of the squat, Escamilla, et al. examined 39 powerlifters and grouped them into three normalized stances. These stances ranged from 87-196% of shoulder width. They were divided into narrow, medium, and wide. Interestingly, there were no differences in trunk angle (anterior bar displacement) between the two groups. There was, however, a difference seen in forward knee movement with the narrow stance having approximately a 4-6 cm greater forward knee movement than the wide stance group. This indicates that they had more of a quadriceps-dominant squat pattern.\nAs you recall, wearing Olympic shoes allows the knees to come forward more, which allows for a more upright torso position. Looking at Olympic weightlifters during the catch phase of the snatch or clean, you can see the knees are well over the toes and the torso is relatively upright. However, it seems that this doesn't matter for powerlifters. This could perhaps be attributed to other things Escamilla found – that powerlifters don't have to squat as deep, that the bar is on their back (instead of their shoulders), and that lifters with a wider stance had more hip flexion than those with a narrow stance.\nThe powerlifters may be doing a hip-dominant squat that engages the glutes and hamstrings more than the quadriceps. Of course, if the narrow-stance powerlifter experienced more knee flexion than hip flexion, then perhaps the Olympic shoes would help them. A squat with more knee flexion may engage the quadriceps muscles more and that's one of the benefits of using the Olympic shoes.\nSo What Kind of Footwear Should You Be Wearing?\nIf you have a quad dominant squat with a narrow stance, or have hypertrophy-oriented goals, Olympic squat shoes may be right for you.\nAre Olympic weightlifting shoes the answer to your squatting dreams? It depends on a few things like, what level squatter are you? What type of squat you have? Is it quad dominant like an Olympic lifter or hip dominant like a powerlifter? And finally, what are your goals? If you're a beginner or intermediate level squatter, Olympic shoes may help you increase your numbers.", "score": 1.1090831507083564e-05, "source": "sparse"}]}

For one, most microbes cannot be grown in culture, which makes it hard to determine their genetic identity. We use the nucleotide sequences of the 16S rRNA gene to determine species. These sequences are unique for each species, and have remained a constant, which means they are highly conserved for each species (they do not change), thereby providing their fingerprint over the last millenium. These sequences also show how closely related one species is to the next and what ancestor they may share in common.\nAs you can see there are three domains— Bacteria, Archaea and Eucarya.

Just because a receptor protein has been identified, does not mean that it is the only receptor for a hormone encoded in the genome. There could be others that operate via different mechanisms. The classic idea of a receptor is that a ligand, the science term for the molecule that binds a receptor, would float in from outside the cell. It would bind and activate the receptor to do something. Receptors can also exist in membranes within cells (that is the case for cytokinin and ethylene receptors). The auxin receptor is free floating within the cell. The basic thing a receptor has to do is bind a ligand that can tell it to start doing something.

In the present study, we reconstructed large phage genomes from freshwater lakes known to contain bacteria that oxidize methane.

The phage-associated PmoC sequences show high similarity to (>90%), and affiliate phylogenetically with, those of coexisting bacterial methanotrophs, including members of Methyloparacoccus, Methylocystis and Methylobacter spp. In addition, pmoC-phage abundance patterns correlate with those of the coexisting bacterial methanotrophs, supporting host–phage relationships. Future work is needed to determine whether phage-associated PmoC has similar functions to additional copies of PmoC encoded in bacterial genomes, thus contributing to growth on methane. Transcriptomics data from Lake Rotsee (Switzerland) showed that some phage-associated pmoC genes were highly expressed in situ and, of interest, that the most rapidly growing methanotroph was infected by three pmoC-phages. Thus, augmentation of bacterial methane oxidation by pmoC-phages during infection could modulate the efflux of this potent greenhouse gas into the environment.\nBacteriophages (phages), viruses that infect and replicate within bacteria, are important in both natural and human microbiomes because they prey on bacterial hosts, mediate horizontal gene transfer, alter host metabolism and redistribute bacterially derived compounds via host cell lysis1. A phenomenon that has recently come to light via metagenomic studies is the prominence of phages with genomes that are much larger than the average size of ~55 kilobases (kb) predicted based on current genome databases2.

In addition, 16 more primitive microorganisms, including one that thrives in boiling hot springs, also exhibit patterns in their genomes that are highly nonrandom.\n“This high degree of organization of prokaryotic [organisms that lack nuclei] genomes is a complete surprise, and this finding carries many implications that biologists might not have considered before,” said Bernhard Palsson, a professor of bioengineering at UCSD’s Jacobs School of Engineering and adjunct professor of medicine and co-author of the analysis. “These findings show that evolution of prokaryotes is constrained not just by variations in the content of genes, but also by the intricate ways in which those genes are arranged on chromosomes.”\nA bacterial cell usually operates with one copy of its genome. Until 2002, there had been no way to determine if a particular gene or area of the chromosome was segregated in any particular way inside individual bacterial cells. New techniques that attach fluorescent “reporter” markers to predetermined spots on chromosomes have indicated that many bacterial genes tend to be found at specific cellular locations. Nonrandom patterns are not obvious in the sequences of prokaryotic genomes, which led the team led by Palsson to use signal-processing methods to identify long-range spatial patterns in the arrangement of sequenced microbial genomes. They related the degree of organization in each genome they studied based on various characteristics.\n“Bacterial chromosomes may have something like ZIP codes that fix groups of genes to certain locations within the cell where they are most needed,” said\nPalsson’s team included Allen, recent Ph.D. graduate Nathan D.

As a result of the intensive genome sequencing efforts of the last decade, and modern bioinformatics approaches to the identification of protein superfamilies, some 10,000 members of the GCN5-related N-acetyltransferase (GNAT) family have been identified. In bacteria, these include family members whose function is (1) the acetylation of aminoglycoside antibiotics, (2) the N-terminal acetylation of the ribosomal proteins S5, S18 and L12, and (3) unknown. The specific aims of the current application are organized to address these three classes of bacterial N-acetyltransferases. Of the thousands of encoded bacterial GNAT proteins, only three are known to acetylate proteins. They are encoded by the rimI, rimJ and rimL genes that are presumed to function in the alpha-N-acetylation of their cognate substrates; the ribosomal S5, S18 and L12 proteins, respectively. The state of acetylation of the latter protein is correlated with bacterial growth, suggesting that reversible enzymatic acetylation/deacetylation is important in controlling bacterial growth. Bacterial resistance to antibiotics is a clinically significant problem that threatens current paradigms of antibacterial chemotherapy. Aminoglycosides were one of the first classes of antibiotics used in the treatment of bacterial infections, and act by specifically inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis. Clinically, the vast majority of resistance is due to the expression of enzymes that modify the drug, including enzymes that phosphorylate, adenylate or acetylate aminoglycosides. Of these three activities, the expression of aminoglycoside N-acetyltransferases is most prevalent in clinical isolates. We will continue our examination of bacterial aminoglycoside N-acetyltransferases. Finally, in the genomes of the important human pathogens, Salmonella typhimurium and Myeobaeterium tuberculosis, there are 29 and 20, respectively, predicted GNAT family members, for which only 8 and 4, respectively, have putative, annotated functions, most of which include the functions discussed above.

These genomic islands result from integration occasions of cellular hereditary components mainly, such as for example insertion sequences, transposons, phages, and plasmids. They may, therefore, be within phylogenetically distant types and are not really conserved among different isolates owned by the same bacterial varieties. This set of genes constitutes the flexible genome. Both gene influx and efflux processes are important in shaping bacterial-genome content material.

Indeed, these small gene systems are found in plasmids as well as with chromosomes, and they are thought to be part of the flexible genome . Although their part, when they are located in plasmid, is fairly clear, the involvement in physiological processes of the TA systems’ chromosomally encoded counterparts is still open to argument.

To know why it is so, we need further insights through individual and community level genomics. Such federated genomics approaches are also likely to help us answer several outstanding questions such as, how virulence evolves as a function of genome optimization under different compulsions offered by a colonized niche; how microbes regulate their genomic streamlining; what environmental stimuli are responsible for the diversification and stratification of microbial lineages; what is the functional significance of prokaryotic genomic diversity especially in the context of host and tissue tropism and towards understanding parasitism versus commensalism; and how can microbial genome data and the observed diversity be experimentally harnessed for the generation and selection of optimally adapted microorganisms? These questions clearly underpin case for sequencing additional representatives from different pathogenic microbial species.\nNovel genes constantly emerge from newly sequenced replicate genomes ,  and thus the concept of a ‘dockyard’ of genes (of presumably unknown functions) that each of the strains harbors. This paradigm was supported by the analyses wherein the pan-genome of a true bacterial species is described to be ‘open’ and each new genome sequence would identify dozens of new genes in the existing pan-genome of Steptococcus agalactiae for example . It is clear also from previous studies that such pool of strain specific genes in pathogens such as Helicobacter pylori, termed the ‘plasticity region cluster’, could be useful in adaptation to a particular host population . This pathogen shows a very strong geographic adaptation and is known for harboring up to 45% strain specific genes with most of them gained through horizontal gene transfers , . Recently the members of the plasticity region cluster were shown to be likely involved in promoting proinflammatory potentials of some of the strains thus providing a survival advantage , .\nAnother important reason to sequence replicate genomes of a prokaryotic species entails need to study chronological evolution of bacterial pathogens within their hosts.

Such prevalent genes (e.g., those involved in transcription and translation or in basic metabolic processes) represent core microbial functions with relatively little dependency (or impact) on the environment the species inhabit. The abundances of these functions in the microbiome are thus arguably not necessarily informative of specific gut environment or host state and are similarly less likely to vary across samples. Likewise, other gene families may not be associated with core microbial functions but rather with processes crucial for surviving specifically in the gut environment (e.g., anaerobic respiration or fermentation) and will therefore be prevalent not across all genomes but rather in gut-dwelling species. These genes will similarly vary relatively little across gut samples and will have little impact on the host. Considering the abundance of these 'all genome-prevalent' and 'gut genome-prevalent' genes when estimating the abundance of various functional pathways in the gut microbiome could therefore mask relevant variation in the abundance of other, more specific genes that are more likely to be associated with the host state (and whose variation across samples is therefore of most interest).\nTo examine the impact of including all genome-prevalent genes in metagenomic functional profiles’ calculation, we first compiled a list of genes that were found to have a similar copy number across all 2337 bacterial genomes in KEGG (see “Methods” and Additional file 3: Table S3). We further compiled a list of gut genome-prevalent genes, including all genes that have a similar copy number across the genomes of a previously characterized set of 177 gut-dwelling bacterial species  (see “Methods” and Additional file 3: Tables S4 and S5). Since our metric of variation depends on the average abundance of the pathway (see “Methods”), here, we did not examine the overall variation in the abundance of each pathway across individuals (since excluding genes is expected to lower the average abundance of pathways) but rather calculated all pairwise distances between the pathway-level functional profiles of the various individuals. Indeed, we found that excluding all genome-prevalent gene families significantly increased the average pairwise distance between individuals (P < 10−15, Student’s t test; Fig. 2; see “Methods”).", "score": 0.010422755360663253, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:ebbee6f3-592a-4b57-b80b-0153e3f7e0da>", "text": "It is estimated that there are at least 35 different phyla of bacteria according to the rRNA gene sequence based tree of life .

It is therefore urgently required to sequence genomes from underrepresented phyla and to improve resolution of deep branches in the bacterial tree so as to enable biological studies of important lineages and to decipher novel functions thereof. In view of these facts more systematic approaches to the sequencing of the microbial genomes are needed to leverage data for the interpretations of environmental surveys as well as to facilitate comparative genomic analyses and annotations of different genomes and microbiomes. The GEBA (Genomic Encyclopedia of Bacteria and Archaea) project is one such ‘community phylogenomics’ initiative that is being implemented at the Joint Genome Institute (http://www.jgi.doe.gov/programs/GEBA/). This program aims at filling the genomic gaps pertaining to bacterial and archaeal branches of the tree of life while using the tree itself as a guide to identify which target microorganisms need to be sequenced completely. Some of the potential benefits of the GEBA project include identification of new protein families across different lineages of bacterial phyla so as to provide a comparative genomics and proteomics platform towards annotation of forthcoming genomes and microbiomes of the same or different phyla. Also, it will facilitate improved phylogenetic anchoring of metagenomic data-sets besides providing better understanding of the processes underlying the evolutionary diversity and functional stratification of different microbes inhabiting various different niches in the environment.\nMany of the pathogenic bacterial species are monomorphic meaning that they present very little diversity upon genetic fingerprinting or limited sequence profiling.

However, few laboratories now use this method and, in practice, novel isolates (and particularly those that presently are unculturable) are usually compared to each other, and to known taxa, by assessing the sequence similarities in their 16S rRNA genes. 16S rRNA sequences are highly conserved and do not provide sufficient resolution to explore the relatedness among closely related bacterial populations and less conserved genes need to be used to delineate similar species.\nIndividual isolates of a named species differ in gene content  and the distribution of these genes is key to understanding the variable properties of isolates of a species, particularly among bacterial pathogens. These auxiliary loci exist alongside the set of genes that are present in all isolates of the named species (the core genome) and which include those that encode enzymes with house-keeping functions . Besides being present in all isolates of a species, the genetic variation in core house-keeping genes is considered to be largely neutral, and thus provides a more reliable indication of genetic relatedness than variation in genes that are subject to strong selection . We would expect any reasonable definition of a species to delineate a cluster of isolates that have very closely-related house-keeping loci that are present in all isolates of a species (as has also been proposed for eukaryotes ).

They may for example include: maintaining the presence of major employers in towns and cities, thus protecting jobs and communities for the long-term; secure the continued occupation of buildings that may otherwise be left vacant and blighted by flooding, to preserve income and asset value and protect local services; re-purpose flood blighted brownfield as development land and potentially reduce pressure on greenfield development and associated negative environmental impacts.\nThe Code of Practice is concerned with the physical changes that can be made to a property to enhance its flood resilience and explains that PFR measures fall into two distinct categories, both of which may be appropriate to use, depending on the type and nature of the flood risk, building construction and end user requirements.", "score": 0.866084218, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:1ee7dca2-2fa0-48f7-9d65-bb39fcc7fb40>", "text": "10 May 2016\nBSI, the business standards company, has published BS 85500:2015 Flood resistant and resilient construction. Guide to improving the flood performance of buildings. The standard looks at the growing risk buildings face from flooding, and is based on the DCLG publication Improving the flood performance of new buildings: Flood resilient construction (2007). It brings the document up to date, focussing on the flood performance of buildings constructed using modern methods of construction (MMC).\nFollowing the widespread flooding of recent years, flood resistance and resilience concerns have continued to be of importance to both local and national Government. Although current policies do not advocate the building of dwellings in areas with a significant risk of flooding, the current lack of affordable housing in the UK could lead to an increased likelihood of development on low or residual flood risk areas.\nNational flood risk management policy requires developments to be safe, to avoid increasing flood risk elsewhere and, where possible, to reduce flood risk overall, so it is critical that new buildings in these areas are designed and built appropriately to cope with floodwaters and minimize the time for reoccupation after a flooding event.\nAnthony Burd Head of Sector, Built Environment at BSI said: “Virtually every winter in the UK we seem to face the problem of flooding. This can have an adverse effect on both the domestic and commercial sector alike, and we are keen to help mitigate the damage it can do. There is not just the matter of the economic health of the construction industry to consider, but how to alleviate the considerable anguish experienced by many UK inhabitants too. Utilizing BS 85500 should enable sound preventative flood safe construction to occur, and bolster consumer confidence to build as a result of that foresight.”\nThe standard provides guidance on how to improve the resistance and resilience of buildings to reduce the impacts of flooding from all sources, by the use of suitable materials and construction measures. It is intended to help manage residual risk after other measures or approaches, such as avoiding risk, locating development in an area of low risk or raising floor levels, have been implemented. The primary area of focus is reducing the impacts of flooding through the design and specification of flood resistance and resilience for new buildings, extensions and retrofits and the adoption of appropriate construction measures.", "score": 0.828644931, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:aa9e5822-0f4f-4477-b9fd-2996d547c1a9>", "text": "Modern homes, by contrast, are designed to do the opposite, with materials such as concrete render used in the construction process to prevent moisture getting into the structure of the home.\nWhen it comes to improving energy efficiency, this difference matters – stopping moisture from escaping a traditional property by covering interior/exterior walls with impermeable insulation can both damage the property and the occupier.\nDespite this disparity, and others, the Government doesn’t take this into account when assessing and recommending energy efficiency retrofits to buildings. With 35% of properties in the UK bracketed as historic or traditional buildings, surely different standards need to apply to traditional and modern homes?\nWith so many rental homes at threat from the MEES changes, a more tailored, pragmatic approach seems best, especially where older properties are concerned. Failing that, more time – or money – needs to be given to landlords with rural properties to help them get their homes up to the required standards. If not, the whole PRS – and rural tenants and landlords in particular – could suffer.", "score": 0.826939881, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:b1db9977-e65f-4543-8d1d-cd6fc0f7946a>", "text": "And thirdly, lenders may be more reluctant to grant commercial loans on property which is at significant risk of flooding.\nThe key to protecting against the risk of possible diminishing values on commercial property is to undertake robust due diligence from the outset. However, according to a report by The College of Estate Management, flood risk related due diligence is increasingly used beyond the initial purchase decision process and is now used to inform ‘post-acquisition adaptation and risk management’. This means that if a property is in a known area of flood risk, if adaptations and changes can be made which mitigate the potential for such events, this can offset the potential loss of value.\nFlooding can lead to commercial property lease disputes\nIt is essential for landlords to understand their contractual risk exposure when it comes to flooding. While it is typically the landlord’s duty to ensure their land and building from flooding related damage, disputes may arise in relation to rent payments if a tenant’s business is interrupted during a flood event. It should be clear who is responsible if damage has occurred to assets located within the property, including stock, machinery, and equipment. Any uninsured risks should also be understood by both landlord and tenant and a prior agreement for potential liability reached.\nTo protect against flood-related disputes, effective planning is essential. Beyond putting in place the necessary insurance cover and commercial lease arrangement, a highly useful approach is to put in place a flood plan in conjunction with your tenant. This will ensure that you both understand your respective roles, responsibilities, and steps which will be undertaken during and after a flood event. This will ensure that no incorrect assumptions are made as to whether action should be taken by landlord or tenant, hence reducing the potential disputes later. For example, if the building is near a river at risk of breaching, who is responsible for putting in place temporary flood barriers? Or if a pipe has burst within the premises, whose role is it to action the repair. Likewise, following the event, who is responsible for any clean-up?\nFlooding can lead to loss of income\nFor any commercial landlord, one of the biggest concerns is that in the event of a natural disaster affecting their premises, rent payments may be delayed or even cease for a number of months, especially if the building requires extensive repair and/or the tenant cannot immediately resume business.", "score": 0.825440466, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:b0ce94ee-c06a-40f6-90d8-4232853a3b8f>", "text": "Home inspections and code enforcement can help to identify those properties most in need of improvements, and changes to zoning and housing rehabilitation codeCodes aimed to make renovations of new homes easier, while also addressing modern safety concerns.s can be made to remove regulatory obstacles to these upgrades.\nIn some areas, the most expensive properties are also the most exposed to climate-related threats, such as homes built on the seaside or near wooded areas where fires can spread. Often, however, low-income neighborhoods experience the worst devastation in the wake of disasters. Where building renovations or upgrades will be insufficient to address the risk, local jurisdictions can use a combination of tenant-based rental assistance and mobility counseling to help these families relocate to parts of town that are outside of high-impact zones. Transfer of development rights programs are another approach that may be used to re-direct development away from areas determined to be too hazardous for continued habitation. These programs can enable the owners of properties in flood-prone areas, for example, to sell their development rights to the owners of properties outside of the floodplain, thereby compensating the seller for the unused development capacity and steering growth to higher ground.\nThis exhibit describes how policy tools in all four categories in the Housing Policy Library can be used to enhance resilience to flooding and other climate-related threats. The policies listed here are illustrative options within each of the four categories. Please see the Housing Policy Library for a full listing and explanation of policy options.\nI. Create and preserve dedicated affordable housing units\nBy prioritizing funding for affordable housing projects located outside of areas at risk of environmental damage, communities can improve resilience.\nIssue general obligation bonds to support development of affordable housing outside of flood plains, or improvements that enhance resilience in existing housing.\nPrioritize projects that incorporate resilience features or are located outside of vulnerable areas when making decisions about how to allocate Low-income Housing Tax Credits or capital subsidies for affordable housing development.\nUse transfer of development rights programs to facilitate relocation of households from at-risk areas when necessary.\nII.

One vexed question that has provoked debate but provided little guidance is how are practitioners expected to comply with their Code 7.11 obligations to 'put things right' when a paradigm example of a solicitor doing that (SRA v Howell Jones LLP (2018)) resulted in an adverse outcome in the Solicitors Disciplinary Tribunal (the SDT)?\nIn light of these questions, we have considered the common types of error, categorised them and predicted how the Solicitors Regulation Authority (the SRA) may - and we emphasise 'may' - approach steps to put them right.

Will the SRA really consider it a good use of time to involve itself with these matters (or to 'insist' that a solicitor cease acting)?

There are several references in the public libraries on retrofitting and additional documents pertaining to floodplain management topics. Documentation is also available at the City, the County, and using the links below. It is a good idea to keep materials around like sandbags, plywood, lumber and plastic sheeting. These materials can help minimize the damage caused not only by flood waters, but damage by hurricane force winds too.\nCity and County Staff are prepared to make site visits, upon request, to assist property owners with flooding, drainage, sewer problems, and to address any site-specific flooding concerns within your community.

If their property is located in a flood zone, the flood zoning can create many problems for the seller or purchaser of those properties. Present government studies project that a significant part of the city is subject to flooding. These studies are presented as flood zone maps which define the flood areas. The costs related to flood insurance, building code requirements and flood control measures are significant. These costs negatively impact the local economy and are a barrier to future economic progress. The financial burden is borne by homeowners, commercial property owners, local business owners and the local government.\nFortunately technology has created the ability to generate new and more accurate studies with up to date rainfall data. This new study can reduce and even eliminate requirements for properties currently located in the old flood zoning map areas. Simi Valley city staff has indicated they are ready to start the new studies. The county is willing to contribute $100,000 towards the studies and as soon as the Simi Valley City Council allocates a $100,0000 match to the commitment from Ventura County, phase one of the preliminary citywide flood studies can begin. Once the engineering studies are done, there are costly and time-consuming FEMA procedures to go through before revision of the flood zone map can take effect. This whole process will take about five years and will cost about approximately $950,000.\nApproximately 2,000 parcels in the city of Simi Valley are currently being insured for flooding which totals approximately $2 million in premiums. This $2 million is money that could be spent on goods and services inside the City by it’s residents and businesses. These insurance premiums are expected to go up each year. Additional parcels and businesses will be affected as property changes ownership and local businesses obtain business financing . This process needs to begin now as the complete study can take up to five years, once completed there will have been an estimated $15 million in premiums paid. This amount does not take into account the impact to property owners and businesses burdened with these premiums.\nConsider, when a home in the flood zone is for sale, potential buyers are confronted with the fact the current and old government flood zoning indicates the property will be flooded and requires flood insurance.

The NFIP is a Federal program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance protection against losses from flooding. The City of Fredericksburg participates in the NFIP. This insurance is designed to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities and the Federal Government that states if a community will adopt and enforce a floodplain management ordinance to reduce future flood risks to new construction in Special Flood Hazard Areas, the Federal Government will make flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection against flood losses.\nVirginia's Floodplain Management Program:\nTo address such problems, Virginia's General Assembly enacted the Virginia Flood Damage Reduction Act of 1989. This legislation was the result of several disastrous floods or coastal storms that hit the state between 1969 and 1985. To improve Virginia's flood protection programs and place related programs in one agency, responsibility for coordination of all state floodplain programs was transferred in 1987 from the Water Control Board to DCR. DCR was named manager of the state's floodplain program and designated coordinating agency of the National Flood Insurance Program under the act, §10.1-602 (PDF), and a governor's memorandum (PDF) released in July 1997.\nFloodplain Management Program department staff works with localities to establish and enforce floodplain management zoning. Localities use the program's state model ordinances, in which minimum standards for local regulations are set, to write their own. Local governments can set more restrictive standards to ensure higher levels of protection for residents in flood hazard areas. Also, the state has used the Virginia Uniform Statewide Building Code to set construction standards for structures built in Federal Emergency Management Agency designated flood hazard areas.\nFloodplain zoning regulates how development is allowed within floodplains. The program's main goal is to protect people and their property from unwise floodplain development. It also protects society from costs associated with developed floodplains.\nThe City's UDO addresses these standards in section 72-34.3, Floodplain Overlay District.\nFor information or questions contact Kevin W.

The same enzyme is also known by an older name, SGPT, which stands for serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase.

However, it is important to recognize that there is not a direct correlation among the elevation of the enzyme, the amount of liver damage and the prognosis for the patient. However, trends may be followed that give an indication of improvement or worsening of liver disease.\nMany diseases may affect ALT, as well as non-liver conditions. For example, congestive heart failure (CHF) may result in poor blood circulation, causing stagnation of liver blood flow and poor liver function.

A sudden escalation of enzymes can cause several debilitating symptoms which can worsen the health of the pet. Read on to know more about the causes, symptoms, and treatment for elevated liver enzymes in dogs…\nIt is often hard to diagnose liver damage in dogs, unless specifically tested for. The liver being a vital organ performs several crucial functions. It metabolizes fats, proteins, and carbohydrates in the body, and plays an important role in the clotting of blood, filtering of toxins, and the safe disposal of waste. It also stores fat-soluble vitamins such as A, D, E, and K, and secretes bile which is vital for the proper metabolism of fats. Therefore, if the liver gets damaged, the dog’s body will not be able to detoxify the various metabolic waste and byproducts.\nThe liver secretes specific enzymes which must maintain a certain level in order for the system to function optimally. When the liver is malfunctioning, these canine liver enzyme levels often rise. If the level of secretion goes beyond the normal level and acceptable margin, the dog may suffer from various health problems.\nTypes of Liver Enzymes in Dogs\nFollowing enzymes are usually checked for determining whether the dog’s liver is malfunctioning or not:\nALT (Alanine Aminotransferase) or SGPT (serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase) is a liver specific enzyme, which is secreted when localized liver cells cease to function. The malfunction of cells in the liver could be due to an infection, injury, or interruption of blood supply. Under abnormal conditions, the serum levels may be four to fivefold higher than the normal level. Such a rapid spike in enzymes can lead to non-hepatic disorders such as, inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract, hemolytic anemia, and heart failure.\nAST (Aspartate Aminotransferase) or SGOT (serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase) enzyme is found in several organs of the body, and is often used as a marker for detecting the state of the liver. This enzyme is predominantly found in the liver, but is also present in the skeletal muscles and red blood cells. An increase in levels of AST implies that the ALT levels have risen as well. A high AST level may also be used as a marker for canine cardiovascular disorders.", "score": 0.867349446, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:e573feb8-00de-403f-b176-a7c86d9639a2>", "text": "A dog undergoing treatment with anticonvulsants and glucocorticoids is likely to show significant increase in its liver ALT levels.\nCongenital diseases like liver shunts, heart conditions, and diseases such as liver cancer and heartworm can also cause the liver enzymes to escalate.\nSymptoms of elevated liver enzymes in dogs are hard to pinpoint as they are subtle, vague, and often similar to other diseases.\nFollowing are some common symptoms observed in dogs suffering from this condition:\n- Pale gray stools\n- Accumulation of fluids in the abdominal cavity\n- Pale gums\n- Polyuria (frequent urination)\n- Polydipsia (when the pet drinks excess water and is always thirsty)\n- Hair loss\n- Lethargy and depression\n- Loss of appetite\n- Weight loss\nThe best course of treatment primarily depends on the degree of the liver enzyme elevation, which determines how sick the dog actually is.\nTherefore, the first step is to address the cause of the dysfunction.

First, your veterinarian will perform a physical exam and look for certain signs, like a distended abdomen, jaundice, pale mucous membranes, dehydration, and poor coat quality.\nDog owners should report any behavioral changes because these symptoms may indicate liver problems. Such behavioral changes include appetite changes, depression, ataxia, and lethargy.\nNext, your vet will perform a complete blood count and serum biochemistry panel to look for changes in the levels of specific substances that suggest liver damage or liver disease.\nAdditionally, an exam called a serum bile acid concentration test may be recommended to study how the liver is functioning.\nYour veterinarian will also perform a urinalysis to look for bilirubin or ammonium biurate crystals in the urine. Whether these crystals are in the urine is another indication of liver function.\nFinally, your veterinarian may recommend a fine needle aspirate (FNA) or biopsy of the liver tissue. An FNA takes a small tissue sample using a special needle, while a biopsy is a larger piece of tissue.\nThese procedures will allow the veterinarian to better understand your dog's liver disease and make a more accurate diagnosis and prognosis.\nHigh Liver Enzymes: Understanding What it Means\nA serum biochemistry panel lists out several liver enzymes, namely alanine aminotransferase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). If you suspect that your dog has liver problems, your veterinarian will also perform this panel to analyze your dog’s ALT, ALP, and AST levels.\nElevated liver enzymes indicate inflammation and damage to liver cells. In humans, elevated liver enzymes are commonly associated with the excessive consumption of alcohol. In dogs, the liver enzymes can be affected by constant exposure to toxins and disease.\nAnalyzing liver enzyme levels helps vets assess the extent of liver damage.\nLiver Disease Treatment\nTreatment for liver disease will vary according to disease stage and underlying cause. For instance, acute liver disease caused by toxin consumption is typically treated with fluids, antibiotics, and liver medications.\nWith that said, we’ll cover a few general treatment methods.\nMany dogs with liver damage or liver disease benefit from dietary changes.", "score": 0.865587831, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:e371d1ad-fa94-4397-ac1f-cab758aebeb8>", "text": "Dogs with extrahepatic bile duct carcinomas and diffuse neuroendocrine tumors present signs of icterus (presence of jaundice in the sclera of the eye).\nThe diagnostic work ups include hemogram, serum biochemistry, radiographs, ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration and needle core biopsy.\nHemogram and serum biochemistry profile are needed since dogs with tumors of the liver usually suffer from leukocytosis (condition characterized by an elevated number of white blood cells), anemia and thrombocytosis (abnormally high number of platelets in the blood).

Javier started for the National League championship clubs of 1964, ’67 and ’68.\nBut in 1972, during spring training at St. Petersburg, Fla., Javier, 35, no longer was prominent in the Cardinals’ plans. Ted Sizemore had taken over as St. Louis’ second baseman the year before. Ed Crosby, 22, was seen as a capable backup.\nOn March 24, 1972, the Cardinals traded Javier to the Reds for pitcher Tony Cloninger.\nThe Reds were desperate for a utilityman. Their dependable reserve infielder, Woody Woodward, had retired. Two non-roster veterans, Bob Aspromonte and Al Weis, hadn’t impressed during spring training and were released. Bob Howsam, who had been the Cardinals general manager before taking the same role with the Reds, was eager to acquire Javier to back up Joe Morgan at second base and Denis Menke at third base.\nAfter the deal was made, Javier indicated he was unhappy with general manager Bing Devine and manager Red Schoendienst for not getting the chance to play more in spring training and compete for a starting job.\nThat prompted an uncharacteristic blast from Schoendienst, a former all-star second baseman. In an interview with St. Louis writer Bob Broeg for The Sporting News, Schoendienst said, “I thought Bing and I had a perfect understanding with Hoolie. And as for playing, he looked trim, but he wasn’t in shape. He couldn’t even get the ball from second base to first.”\nIn 12 seasons (1960-71) with the Cardinals (11 as their regular second baseman), Javier twice was named an all-star (1963 and ’68), twice led NL second basemen in putouts (1963 and ’64) and collected 1,450 hits.\nA right-handed batter, he was mediocre against right-handed pitching (career .233 batting average) but a force against left-handed pitching (career .299 batting average).\nJavier’s lifetime batting marks against some of the best NL left-handers of the era are eye-catching.", "score": 0.838043571, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:e40267a1-a5fb-41ed-9441-ecdc918b7e5d>", "text": "Examples: Warren Spahn (.306, 19-for-62), Claude Osteen (.417, 30-for-72), Ken Holtzman (.417, 25-for-60), Mike McCormick (.360, 18-for-50) and Mike Cuellar (.345, 10-for-29).\nAfter the 1970 season, the Cardinals acquired Sizemore from the Dodgers in a deal involving slugger Dick Allen. Meanwhile, Javier was found to owe back taxes to the U.S. government, leading to speculation the native of the Dominican Republic could become entangled in a legal case that might jeopardize his career.\nHowever, Javier worked out a settlement on his tax problems before reporting to spring training in 1971. When he arrived in St. Petersburg, he was 10 pounds lighter (at 180) and performed more like the player he’d been on those championship teams.\nIn the April 17, 1971, edition of The Sporting News, Neal Russo wrote of Javier, “He looked outstanding in Florida. He still rates among the major leagues’ best at the keystone sack and he was stinging the ball, too.”\nBecause of an injury to Dal Maxvill, Sizemore opened the ’71 season as the Cardinals’ shortstop and Javier remained the starter at second base.\nThough he started poorly (2 hits in his first 19 at-bats), Javier soon provided an offensive spark for the Cardinals. At the end of May, his batting average was .309. Then he cooled off. His batting mark fell to .234 at the end of June. Maxvill returned to shortstop and Sizemore moved to second, replacing Javier.\nThe trade to the Reds the following spring turned out to be a blessing for Javier. He had several key hits for the Reds in helping them win the NL pennant.

That minor league franchise won the PCL title in 1937, led by then-18-year-old San Diegan Ted Williams . The team's name, Spanish for \"fathers\", refers to the Spanish Franciscan friars who founded San Diego in 1769.\nIn 1969, the San Diego Padres joined the ranks of Major League Baseball as one of four new expansion teams, along with the Montreal Expos (now the Washington Nationals ), the Kansas City Royals and the Seattle Pilots (now the Milwaukee Brewers ). Their original owner was C. Arnholt Smith , a prominent San Diego businessman and former owner of the PCL Padres whose interests included banking, tuna fishing, hotels, real estate and an airline. Despite initial excitement, the guidance of longtime baseball executives, Eddie Leishman and Buzzie Bavasi as well as a new playing field , the team struggled; the Padres finished in last place in each of its first six seasons in the NL West , losing 100 games or more four times. One of the few bright spots on the team during the early years was first baseman and slugger Nate Colbert , an expansion draftee from the Houston Astros and still (as of 2009) the Padres' career leader in home runs.\nBefore the 1974 season began, the Padres were on the verge of being sold to Joseph Danzansky , who was planning to move the franchise to Washington, D.C. by the beginning of the 1974 season. People were so convinced the transfer would happen that new uniforms were designed. Even the baseball card companies were fooled. About half of the Padres' player cards printed by Topps that season displayed \"Washington National League\" as the team name. But C. Arnholt Smith changed his mind, and instead sold the Padres to McDonald's co-founder Ray Kroc , who was not interested in moving the team and kept the team in San Diego.", "score": 0.812615, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:aeee8e01-57f9-4cab-a95d-a23abb825e10>", "text": "After an MLB career that went from 1951 to 1964, he became a manager in the Boston Red Sox minor league system.

Though he had some talent such as Catfish Hunter and Reggie Jackson, he led the team to an AL West title in 1971 and to back to back World Series wins in 1972 and 1973.

This was not the free-spending Autry of the free-agency era who would explode into the winter player markets a few years later; this was the 13-year owner of a major-market team who Williams believed tried to get talent on the cheap, and who delivered teams that were middling at best. In the previous seven seasons, the Angels had finished at or above .500 only once, 86-76, in 1970, good enough for 3rd place in a six-team division.\nWilliams said, \"They lost simply because the players were like day-old, marked-down doughnuts. They came cheap and even then they weren't worth the money.\" Whitey Herzog, Williams's former teammate who'd made a post-playing career out of player development and who was serving as Angels interim manager, warned Dick the system was not loaded with young talent.27 Lack of talent may not have been the reason the Angels struggled to deliver winning teams, in spite of Dick's opinion. Harold Parrott, who had served in the Angels' front-office in the years before Williams' arrival blamed the team's consistent underachievement on the lack of focus caused by years of warring cliques in the front office, and the owner's disinclination to discipline any of the participants.28\nRegardless of the reasons for the dysfunction, Williams knew, in retrospect, it was a mistake, but his competitive drive made him leave MacArthur and MacArthur's business-transformation workshops prematurely for another baseball job. He craved the immediate, strong feedback of winning or losing a game, something missing from the corporate world. While a turnaround artist such as Williams could work the magic of behavioral change in baseball within a few weeks, the corporate world moves slowly, resists change more effectively, exhibits improvement less clearly. So Williams snapped at the suicide mission and lashed himself to the Angels' fate.

The city of St. Louis managed to fight off a very attractive bid for the Cardinals by Atlanta city. Atlanta was promising Bidwell a new stadium and St. Louis had to improve the terms for the Busch Stadium. During the 80s, the Cardinals’ results continued to be characteristically poor. This, combined with the poor state of the Busch stadium resulted in a consistent decline in fan turnout. Rumors started making the rounds of an impending move away from St. Louis at the beginning of the 1987 season. These were confirmed by Bidwell as the season progressed leading to a bitter lash back from fans. He in fact received death threats and this made him stay away from the last few home games at the Busch stadium. Eventually, he picked the city of phoenix as the new home of his franchise, renaming the team Phoenix Cardinals. After a five year stay in Phoenix the team again changed names to “Arizona Phoenix” and that is what it goes by to this day.

I can’t help but wonder if the root cause is in how the roster has changed.\nAt the end of the 2006 season, the Cardinals had been in the playoffs three consecutive years, the NLCS every year, the World Series twice, and were the reigning World Champions. Since, they have not won a playoff game. The 2007 team saw a lot of injuries, and after that season two stalwarts of those mid-decade juggernauts left via trade: Jim Edmonds (to San Diego) and Scott Rolen (to exile, er, Toronto).\nLooking back, St Louis had seen this before. In 1987 the Cardinals concluded their most successful run of sustained superior baseball since the El Birdos teams 20 years earlier. In six years, they had won the National League three times, the World Series once, and narrowly missed two other titles. But times were changing in St Louis, and with Gussie Busch taking a back seat to Fred Kuhlmann cost became the primary driver on roster decisions. Jack Clark, a free agent after the 1987 season, was not re-signed; he went to the Yankees. Tommy Herr, in his last year with the club, was traded to Minnesota for Tom Brunansky.\nIt should be emphasized the drivers for these sets of roster moves were different. Edmonds was traded because his injury history had caught up to him, and he was no longer the productive player he had been in 2005. Rolen’s significant shoulder injuries sapped him of his power; although the primary driver for his relocation north of the border can be traced to his acerbic relationship with manager Tony LaRussa. Clark and Herr left because the club did not want to pay them.\nBut the impact on the roster of losing these players was immediate and long-lasting. Clark was the lone power threat on the Whiteyball teams of the 1980s; St Louis never really did replace his production. Herr was a clubhouse leader. His departure was hugely unpopular in St Louis, and the team suffered for his loss.

The team then moved to the National League and changed its name to the Cardinals in the year 1900.\nThe first two decades were spent in establishing the teams name in the division without too much success but things started to look up when for the St Louis Cardinals in 1920 when Branch Rickey joined as the General Manager. It proved to be a great move as Rickey started to transform the team from top to bottom. All the hard work paid off during the historic 1926 as the team not only won the National League pennant but also beat hot favorites Yankees to capture their first World title. Another pennant followed the next year with two more coming in 1930 and 1931. The St Louis Cardinals were beaten in the first of the two finals by Philadelphia Athletics but avenged that loss by reversing the tables on the Athletics in 1932 to capture their second World Championship. 1934 brought another pennant and a third World title for the team as they started to dominate that era consistently.\nThe second part of that decade went quietly but all the changed in 1941 with the signing of Stan “the Man” Musial. Stan is regarded by many as the greatest ever player in St Louis Cardinals history. He had talent in abundance and was one of the most destructive hitters of his time.

Do in-between infinities exist? We may never know.\nThroughout the first half of the 20th century, mathematicians tried to resolve the continuum hypothesis by studying various infinite sets that appeared in many areas of mathematics. They hoped that by comparing these infinities, they might start to understand the possibly non-empty space between the size of the natural numbers and the size of the real numbers.\nMany of the comparisons proved to be hard to draw. In the 1960s, the mathematician Paul Cohen explained why. Cohen developed a method called “forcing” that demonstrated that the continuum hypothesis is independent of the axioms of mathematics — that is, it couldn’t be proved within the framework of set theory. (Cohen’s work complemented work by Kurt Gödel in 1940 that showed that the continuum hypothesis couldn’t be disproved within the usual axioms of mathematics.)\nCohen’s work won him the Fields Medal (one of math’s highest honors) in 1966. Mathematicians subsequently used forcing to resolve many of the comparisons between infinities that had been posed over the previous half-century, showing that these too could not be answered within the framework of set theory. (Specifically, Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory plus the axiom of choice.)\nSome problems remained, though, including a question from the 1940s about whether p is equal to t. Both p and t are orders of infinity that quantify the minimum size of collections of subsets of the natural numbers in precise (and seemingly unique) ways.\nThe details of the two sizes don’t much matter. What’s more important is that mathematicians quickly figured out two things about the sizes of p and t. First, both sets are larger than the natural numbers. Second, p is always less than or equal to t. Therefore, if p is less than t, then p would be an intermediate infinity — something between the size of the natural numbers and the size of the real numbers. The continuum hypothesis would be false.\nMathematicians tended to assume that the relationship between p and t couldn’t be proved within the framework of set theory, but they couldn’t establish the independence of the problem either. The relationship between p and t remained in this undetermined state for decades.", "score": 0.808723688, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:d9bf1dc5-6894-4c3b-af06-35087cbcd4ac>", "text": "“In the case of the Riemann hypothesis, there are some approaches based on analogies, but no real strategy has emerged.” The conjecture, which dates back to 1859, focuses on primes – numbers that have the property of being divisible only by themselves and by 1, like 13. The goal is to describe how these numbers are distributed among all integers. To solve the problem, the German mathematician Riemann used the definition of the “zeta function”, which had already been considered by the Swiss scientist Euler in the 18th century, and showed that it made it possible to describe the frequency of occurrences of prime numbers with great precision.\nBut not everyone agreed with this theory. “A number of research studies use the hypothesis as a starting point, which means that the results obtained are conditional,” Tenenbaum explains. “The conjecture leads to many remarkable consequences, only one of which needs to be disproven in order to refute it.” If the assumption were to be proven false, a great many conditional theorems would have no more basis. Still, even if it is refuted, the thesis indisputably yields an image that is very close to reality: so far more than 10 billion values have been verified by computer and corroborate the hypothesis. However, for the mathematical community, this is evidence but not proof!\nIT to the rescue?\nWill the confirmation or rejection of conjectures be facilitated by the emerging field of computer-assisted proof? Digital tools like the French Coq system5 can be used to write and verify proofs, providing correction guarantees in fields where evidence becomes complex. They showed their effectiveness in 2010 with the four colour theorem, a hypothesis that had spawned many false demonstrations. The theorem asserts that it is possible, using only four different colours, to divide any map into contiguous regions so that any two adjacent zones always have a different shade. These tools led to the acceptance of one demonstration, announced in 1976 and based on mathematical arguments backed by several thousand cases calculated for the first time by computer.

Ketonen wanted to formulate Skolem's formal rules of proof within sequent calculus. However, Ketonen's work was mostly known only through its review by Bernays and only the logical part on sequent calculus was explained in detail there.\nA second way to apply the sequent calculus is to let sequents that begin derivation branches have, in addition to initial sequents, also the form → A, in which A is an axiom, or an instance of a universal axiom. Now, by Gentzen's “extended Hauptsatz”, cuts in derivations can be permuted up until one of their premisses is an axiom, but these cuts on axioms remain. Another, newer method is to convert axioms into extra rules that are added to the logical rules of sequent calculus, with full cut elimination maintained (as explained in Negri and von Plato 2001, chapter 6, and in Troelstra and Schwichtenberg's 2000, chapter 4.7).\nTo what extent has proof theory achieved its original aims? For Hilbert, the aims were a complete clarification of the foundational problems through finitary proofs of consistency, etc, aims in which proof theory failed. Hilbert in his program was not interested in the study of mathematical proofs in themselves, but only in clearing the central foundational problems (and then to forget about them). A recently found note by Hilbert gives a different picture: the note states that Hilbert wanted to add as a 24th and last problem in his famous Paris list of open mathematical problems of 1900 the development of “a theory of proof methods in mathematics”. This was before his metamathematical program for the development of a proof theory emerged.\nFor Gentzen, the aims were, along with those of Hilbert, to understand the structure of mathematical proofs. This program was a complete success as far as pure logic and arithmetic are concerned. The methods of sequent calculus, especially, permit the analysis of proofs with profound results.

Because commercial data were not available for 2000, a percentage change for 1995 to 2000 cannot be calculated for this combined category.\nWithdrawals for \"other industrial uses\" were between 37 and 39 Bgal/d between 1950 and 1960, and then increased to the range of 45 and 47 Bgal/d for the years reported from 1965 to 1980. Withdrawals declined by about 32 percent to 30 Bgal/d between 1980 and 1985; the decline continued to about 29 Bgal/d in 1995. Because data were not classified separately from 1960 to 1980, it is not known how much of the \"other industrial use\" was attributable to commercial and mining withdrawals. However, it is evident that by 2000 the \"other industrial use\" category was at its lowest level since data were first reported for 1950. For the industrial withdrawals not to be at the lowest level since 1950, commercial water use, which was not reported for 2000, would have had to more than double between 1995 and 2000. That scenario for commercial water use is improbable.\nBecause withdrawal data were compiled independently for the industrial category for 1985 through 2000, the changes in the industrial category may be compared for those years. Total industrial withdrawals decreased by 24 percent from about 26 Bgal/d during 1985 to less than 20 Bgal/d during 2000.", "score": 0.048833098496212896, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:e1747d09-8f66-4257-8ab7-f0df32455acd>", "text": "No Irish Need Apply?

Misunderstanding the rigor is a cause for some of the common misconceptions of mathematics. Today, mathematicians continue to argue among themselves about computer-assisted proofs. Since large computations are hard to verify, such proofs may be erroneous if the used computer program is erroneous. On the other hand, proof assistants allow verifying all details that cannot be given in a hand-written proof, and provide certainty of the correctness of long proofs such as that of the Feit–Thompson theorem.\nAxioms in traditional thought were \"self-evident truths\", but that conception is problematic. At a formal level, an axiom is just a string of symbols, which has an intrinsic meaning only in the context of all derivable formulas of an axiomatic system. It was the goal of Hilbert's program to put all of mathematics on a firm axiomatic basis, but according to Gödel's incompleteness theorem every axiomatic system has undecidable formulas; and so a final axiomatization of mathematics is impossible. Nonetheless mathematics is often imagined to be nothing but set theory in some axiomatization, in the sense that every mathematical statement or proof could be cast into formulas within set theory.\nFields of mathematicsMathematics can, broadly speaking, be subdivided into the study of quantity, structure, space, and change. In addition to these main concerns, there are also subdivisions dedicated to exploring links from the heart of mathematics to other fields: to logic, to set theory, to the empirical mathematics of the various sciences, and more recently to the rigorous study of uncertainty. While some areas might seem unrelated, the Langlands program has found connections between areas previously thought unconnected, such as Galois groups, Riemann surfaces and number theory.\nDiscrete mathematics conventionally groups together the fields of mathematics which study mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous.\nFoundations and philosophyIn order to clarify the foundations of mathematics, the fields of mathematical logic and set theory were developed. Mathematical logic includes the mathematical study of logic and the applications of formal logic to other areas of mathematics; set theory is the branch of mathematics that studies sets or collections of objects. The phrase \"crisis of foundations\" describes the search for a rigorous foundation for mathematics that took place from approximately 1900 to 1930.", "score": 0.016473817968365164, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:e7477119-bf24-4e25-be1d-0cd578c0c93c>", "text": "It looks like you're using Internet Explorer 11 or older.

Friend the Member for Aldershot (Mr Howarth), who has taken a close interest in this matter, but who is unavoidably on a Select Committee visit to the Netherlands. My hon. Friend has, however, left me a copy of a publication which is one of his prized possessions. It is a venerable, official history of British airborne divisions, entitled \"By Air to Battle\". Typically, because the Pegasus symbol is directly identified with anything to do with the airborne forces, that symbol adorns the front cover of the publication.\nMy hon. Friend particularly drew my attention to the part of the publication that refers to members of the airborne forces being honoured in December 1944 at a special investiture held in Buckingham palace. It says:\n\"Each officer and man of these ... divisions wears upon his shoulder the badge of Pegasus, the winged horse and its rider, brandishing a lance. As an emblem it is singularly appropriate, and whenever the citizens of Britain catch sight of it, they may perhaps call to mind that other horse which, long ago, it is said, brought armed men into the city of Troy –the vanguard of a victorious army.\"\nTo have an entire debate about insignia might seem to exaggerate the importance of such symbolism but, when we consider it in contexts other than the military, we know that that is not the case.

Males in the navy once wore a blue/black beret but replaced it with the US Navy's sailor hat.\nSome corps or units have small variations in their uniforms – for instance, military policemen wear a white belt and police hat, Naval personnel have dress whites for parades, Paratroopers are issued a four pocket Tunic (shirt) meant to be worn untucked with a pistol belt cinched tight around the waist over the shirt. Similarly, while most IDF soldiers are issued black leather boots, some units issue reddish-brown leather boots for historical reasons — the paratroopers, combat medics, Nahal and Kfir brigades, as well as some SF units (Sayeret Matkal, Oketz, Duvdevan, Maglan, Counter-Terror School). Women are also issued sandals.\nIDF soldiers have three types of insignia (other than rank insignia) which identify their corps, specific unit, and position.\nA pin attached to the beret identifies a soldier's corps. Soldiers serving in staffs above corps level are often identified by the General Corps pin, despite not officially belonging to it, or the pin of a related corps.

Among the list of units our sources had provided, only a small number had this equipment.\n\"The fact that we can identify that that's a BTR-82 Type A is significant because there's only two brigades [in Russia's Central Military District] that actually field that equipment,\" Barros said. \"And those are the 15th Brigade and the 30th Brigade.\"\nRussian military doctrine suggests that these BTRs, and these brigades — the 15th and 30th — would have been used for clearing operations.\nClearing is a task that militaries do when they're going into a contested area to ensure that it's safe,\" Barros explained. And he sees evidence of that mission in Bondarenko's videos.\n\"They're walking down the main stretch of the village, what it looks like, and they're checking, you know, house to house. They're peeking over fences. And what they're probably doing is a clearing operation,\" he said.\nBy identifying the two units that were most likely in Nova Basan, we dramatically narrowed down the number of suspects. The Russian military deployed a ground force of about 120,000 people to Ukraine during its initial invasion.\nThe two units we had identified, the 15th and 30th brigades, had far fewer soldiers: about 4,000, Barros said.\nOur eyewitness Holod said he saw five BTRs in the immediate vicinity when Oleksandr was killed.

The commentator tried to bring the occasion to life for an eager audience that could be half a world away. And nowadays, even as we live in the age of television, sports fans still like to be told what is going on and to get little insights from the experts.\nCommentators often become celebrities in their own right. Before his retirement, could anyone watch Formula One motor racing in Britain without the iconic Murray Walker’s tones accompanying the action. This wonderful commentator was an expert in his sport but would make verbal howlers on a regular basis, one of which was to become his catch phrase, ”Unless I’m very much mistaken – and I AM very much mistaken!”\nEvery sport, though, has its own best-known commentators. For rugby, the late Bill McLaren was respected around the world for his incisive and impartial commentary. He had the knack of knowing when to be informative and when to be humorous, and he had the rare talent of knowing when to be silent. And where Bill McLaren was the voice of rugby, so the late Dan Maskell was the voice of Wimbledon for 40 years, with his famous phrase, “Oh, I say”.\nWhile commentators are supposed to be able to relate events to viewers there are times when they are lost for words. Who can forget New Zealander Keith Quinn’s comments when All Black Jonah Lomu ran round England’s flailing defence and then through Mike Catt to score? “Lomu, Lomu. …Oh…oh”, was all he could come up with.\nWith the Ashes 2013 test series now under way, the spotlight is currently on cricket commentators. Fortunately for the fans, cricket is blessed with a wealth of excellent commentators who have unsurpassed knowledge of the game. One of the best, of course, was the late Tony Greig, whose laid back style attracted a loyal following from fans around the world.\nMany of the current crop are former test cricketers themselves and bring a wealth of knowledge and fascinating insight to their commentary.", "score": 0.83466965, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:56811676-c27d-4272-b1c8-2fd86035e158>", "text": "Test Match Special\n|Genre||Sport (cricket) commentary|\n|Running time||During England Matches|\n|Home station||Five Live Sports Extra & BBC Radio 4 longwave|\n|Air dates||since 1957|\n|Audio format||LW, digital radio and digital TV|\nTest Match Special (also known as TMS) is a British radio programme, originally, as its name implies, dealing exclusively with Test Matches, but currently covering any professional cricket, broadcast on BBC Radio 4 (long wave), Five Live Sports Extra (digital) and via the internet to the United Kingdom and (where broadcasting rights permit) the rest of the world.

Live cricket had been broadcast since 1927, but originally it was thought that Test match cricket was too slow for ball-by-ball commentary to work. However, Seymour de Lotbiniere ('Lobby'), who was responsible for live sports coverage and who went on to become an outstanding head of outside broadcasts at the BBC, realised that ball-by-ball commentary could make compelling radio. In the mid-1930s he got Howard Marshall to begin commentating on cricket, rather than only giving reports. From the mid-1930s to the 1950s the amount of ball-by-ball commentary gradually increased, but it was not until TMS was launched in 1957 that every ball was covered for their British audience.\nRobert Hudson was responsible for the launch of TMS, writing to his Outside Broadcasts boss Charles Max-Muller in 1956, proposing broadcasting full ball-by-ball coverage of Tests rather than only covering fixed periods, and suggesting using the Third Programme (as BBC Radio 3 was then known) frequency, since at that time the Third Programme only broadcast in the evening.\nTMS became a fixture on BBC Radio 3 on AM medium wave until Radio 3 lost its MW frequency in February 1992.", "score": 0.832005, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:8b236a38-ec76-493a-bbd8-6d00ec140e83>", "text": "The passing of Richie Benaud, the former Australian cricket captain and long-time television commentator in Britain and his native Australia, recalls an era in broadcasting when a voice became synonymous with a sport. For many, like me, who grew up watching cricket on BBC television, Benaud’s crisp Aussie accent delivered incisive and often wry analysis of the game of cricket.\nBenaud grew up in New South Wales during the great depression of the early 1930’s. Cricket was a natural distraction for many young Australians and Don Bradman was the most captivating player of the age. Taught how to bowl as a youngster by his father Lou, Benaud made his debut in the Sheffield Shield in 1949 and received his first “Baggy Green” cap for Australia against the West Indies in January 1952.\nBenaud’s record as an all-round cricketer would have been enough to ensure his status as one of Australia’s all-time greats and as captain he revitalised Australian cricket in the early-1960s. But he was as courageous in life as he was on the field, and in 1959 took the previously unprecedented step of signing up for a broadcasting training course at the BBC while still at the peak of his powers as a professional sportsman.\nWhen the BBC’s head of sport, Bryan Cowgill, offered him a role in the commentary box in 1964 he became, arguably, the first of a generation of commentators to successfully make the leap from performing in front of the camera to the principal communicator behind one. Others, such as English test cricketer Denis Compton, had taken on the role as summariser, but Benaud was the main voice people heard in their living rooms.\nIn interviews and his autobiographies, Benaud always paid homage to some of the pioneering television commentators of the 1950’s including Henry Longhurst (golf), Dan Maskell (tennis) and Peter O’Sullivan (horse racing). Both Longhurst and Maskell had the unerring skill to know when to be silent, and O’Sullivan was imperious in his preparation and knowledge of the event he was covering.\nBenaud combined both skills with alacrity. Unlike radio, where silence in the commentary box is a major faux pas, in television sport knowing when to shut up and let the picture tell the story remains the most valued attribute of the commentator on top of their game.", "score": 0.825940549, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:89d50162-4ce2-4dd5-9812-caa03d96ce54>", "text": "Dickie Bird, Henry Blofeld and Brian Johnston\nAudio CD (10 May 2004)\nHodder and Stoughton Audio Books; ISBN: 1840328339\nNow available for the first time on one CD and as an audio download, here is a bumper collection of funny stories and anecdotes from the world of cricket as told by three of the game’s all-time great characters – Dickie Bird, Henry Blofeld and Brian Johnston.\nRecorded live in front of appreciative theatre audiences, here are dozens of hilarious stories about legendary Test cricketers such as Richie Benaud, Ian Botham, Geoffrey Boycott, Michael Holding and Fred Trueman – as well as some of the most famous gaffes and practical jokes carried out by the commentary team on BBC Radio’s Test Match Special.\nEnjoy three of the best storytellers in the business as they prove that cricket is a funny game – even when rain stops play!\nRichie Benaud, Dickie Bird, Henry Blofeld, Brian Johnston & Fred Trueman\nAudio CD (1 November 2007)\nHodder & Stoughton Audio Books; ISBN: 978-1844567003\nCricket is often said to be a funny game and now you can hear why with another brilliant collection of humorous stories, jokes and anecdotes from the world of cricket as told by five of the game’s all-time great personalities – Richie Benaud, Dickie Bird, Henry Blofeld, Brian Johnston and Fred Trueman.\nRecorded live in theatres and in the studio here are dozens of hilarious anecdotes about England players such as Denis Compton, Len Hutton, Mike Brearley and Ian Botham – not to mention broadcasting gaffes, sledging, short-sighted umpires and the first male streaker at Lord’s!\nChristopher Martin-Jenkins, Peter Baxter, Barry Johnston, Robert Powell\nAudio CD ((2 Sept 2010)\nHodder & Stoughton Audio Books; ISBN: 978-1444711363\nFrom the producers of the Number One bestselling CD The Wit of Cricket, here is their latest collection of the funniest cricket stories at home and abroad, recorded live at Great Brickhill Cricket Club in Bedfordshire.\nFeaturing a rare live recording of the late cricket commentator Christopher Martin-Jenkins, who was a brilliant after-dinner speaker, here are dozens of hilarious anecdotes about the Ashes, overseas tours, sledging, Test Match Special, and much more!", "score": 0.819406331, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:56811676-c27d-4272-b1c8-2fd86035e158>", "text": "The voices of the TMS commentators have become part of the sound of an English summer, and there is a tradition of the commentators being referred to by nicknames (often based on the first syllable of their surname, plus the syllable \"-ers\").

The start of Radio 5 Live meant that TMS moved to its present home on Radio 4 long wave (198 LW, plus various localised MW frequencies including 720 MW in London and 603 MW in the North East). At times of cricket matches, the normal BBC Radio 4 schedule continues on its FM frequencies, whilst longwave is taken over by the cricket.\nDigital Radio was seen as the solution for \"where to put\" TMS and a way for cricket fans to avoid broadcasts of the Shipping Forecast, Daily Service and Yesterday in Parliament which would otherwise interrupt the cricket. Since 2002 it has been broadcast on Five Live Sports Extra, which is the network the BBC primarily cross-promote on air. Five Live Sports Extra is also streamed via the Internet (though sometimes only available in the UK due to rights issues). Full commentaries are now available for 30 days on the BBC iPlayer and since late-2015 a \"live-rewind\" feature is available.\nMany spectators who are present at Test matches listen to TMS via headphones attached to portable radios.

And much has been said about what players are right for the format and what aren’t. Rightly so, too. Horses for courses is very much prevalent in ODI and Test cricket and it’s only natural if this is extended to T20 — the future of cricket.\nTV coverage of cricket is pretty standardized. Apart from the cheerleaders, there isn’t much innovation. If you think showing more stats or graphics is innovation, then no. We have had the same stumpcam, same overhead cameras and angles for years now. The picture quality has improved, but that’s about all. The IPL had one innovation with a moving camera over the pitch, but that wasn’t too popular with the players (and also raised some valid questions). So what we are basically left with for additional entertainment are the commentators. And they — at their best — are staid to put it mildly.\nIf players are chosen for a particular format of the game, why can’t the same apply to commentators? That would rule out such orators as Sunil Gavaskar, Sanjay Manjrekar, Anil Kumble, Nasser Hussain and more who haven’t even ever played T20 (except Kumble). So to be fair, their understanding of the format is as good or poor as the layman. Okay, so they’ve played international cricket, but then, horses for courses, no?\nImagine if some colorful commentators (like Danny Morrison who does talk a bit through his head, but it’s fun) were to take over commentary for T20… that would add to the frenetic pace of the game and make it enjoyable to watch on TV. What we have right now are former players going through a book (perhaps) that has cricketing cliches and reading them out as required.\nJust a thought… can’t we have someone who can talk like he is alive (Hussain and Kumble together is a snoozefest at it most exciting moments!) and maybe have some fun too?", "score": 0.013421732687752036, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:9eb06e91-6786-4b72-8e5d-2dc93f93f132>", "text": "Like every year, the Hong Kong Cricket Sixes 2012 was a highly anticipated event. The priceless autumn weekend promised a fall of cricketing talents, as international players and commentators were expected to descend onto one of the world’s greatest (non-test) cricket grounds. The recently completed World Twenty20 set the tempo aptly, and the locals were ready for their own live show of shortened and quick games, each filled with twists and thrills.\nWhat they got in the end was, as some would say, a mixed bag. Although they were invited to a genuine glimpse of international cricket, many of the fans felt tricked by the drought of stars that eventually appeared – despite the cloudy conditions.\nIn pure cricketing lingo, the entire local Indian crowd was bowled out for a golden duck. Most of them, who arrived with eager aspirations to meet some of their national and Indian Premiere League (IPL) heroes, were aghast when instead they saw seven self-proclaimed cricketers. Not a single name from the squad was known to even the most devout of cricket followers, and the fans were left in blues following their team’s early exit. And add to that the fact that the team arrived at the venue straight from the Airport, without any rest.\nVivek Bakshi, their team manager, reasoned that the players who were initially chosen for the event have all recently been selected to play for India’s biggest domestic competition, the Ranji Trophy. Since some of them are also slated to play in India’s international fixtures against England next month, a knee-jerk decision was made to withdraw them all on the basis of fitness precaution. This justification, however, brought no consolation to the local fans, as they expected – and even demanded – better organization from the world’s richest cricket board. Clearly (and understandably) this year’s winner’s prize of (just) US$40,000 wasn’t enough to lure even the fringe Indian players of international cricket.\nImmediately, the spark that was expected from an India cricket match was already rusted. The Indian fans didn’t have a clue of which player to cheer for, and their opponents didn’t pay them much respect either. Needless to say, even the ‘India-Pakistan’ clash was relegated to a one-sided affair.

I took it all in.\nWhen I am commentating I love good cricket but I hate bad cricket. Some critics of me feel commentators should support and only say nice things about the England team.

Constructed in 1865 by two local merchants, the Opera House’s first event celebrated the return of the 86th Indiana Volunteers from the Civil War. The Opera House, located on the third floor, was closed in 1914 due to concerns of fire safety, and space sat unused and neglected for the next 82 years until it was purchased by the Delphi Preservation Society.\nKJG’s first involvement with the project was conducting a structural analysis of the three-story building in 2006 and then developing schematic design options in 2007 for the proposed renovation. Thanks to a Stellar Grant and dozens of generous benefactors, the Delphi Opera House Restoration received the necessary funding, plans were completed in 2012, and the facility opened in 2014.\nThe Opera House space on the third floor was kept to its original design while restoring all of the finishes. Even the original balcony and the sets of narrow stairs leading to the third floor were maintained, although reinforced to meet current code. A new entrance, ticket office, and art gallery were added on the first floor of the building, and a new grand stairway was built to allow guests to reach the second floor and then proceed to the Opera House via the original staircases. While it was important to maintain the historic elements of the Opera House, modern necessities and conveniences were added thanks to a 3 story addition on the rear of the building. This addition provides room for necessities such as an elevator, two fire-rated stair towers, restrooms, fire sprinkler room, and mechanical/electrical rooms and also provided space for conveniences such as a concession stand, banquet room, and green room adjacent to the stage.\nThe efforts of the Delphi Preservation Society and KJG’s design team brought back to life an iconic building that now boasts a bustling schedule of civic events and entertainment (see: www.delphioperahouse.org/event-list).", "score": 0.816231072, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:7006820d-45a1-42de-8251-53f6f45a264f>", "text": "Opera has been in Chicago since the 1850’s.

It established the city as an operatic center of national prominence, thanks in large part to music director and conductor Cleofante Campanini’s openness to experimentation and innovation and to the patronage of Harold and Edith McCormick. Mr. Campanini was the younger brother of tenor Italo Campanini, who sang in Chicago during the 1880’s, and was also the brother-in-law of the great coloratura soprano Luisa Tetrazzini.\nThe Company launched its career on Thursday, 3 November 1910, with a sold out production of Aida. This was not the first time Aida opened a Chicago opera season, but none more spectacularly as this one. The Record-Herald critic, Felix Borowski, wrote:\nThe success of Chicago opera means the success of all culture in this city and the establishment of a finer standard of art than has ever been known here before.\nThe following Saturday night, Chicago heard Pelléas et Mélisande and Mary Garden for the first time.

It was owned and operated by W.P.K. Hedrick and was first opened on April 6, 1889. One of the favorite shows to play was “Drummer Boy of Shilo” which drew in huge crowds. Not only was it the opera house, but also the community center. Social activities would take place in the opera house until 1906 when a new building was built on 10th and Main Streets. The original building fell in disuse for a few years. It was not until 1909 when the Crystal Theater took up the building that it started to see more use. In 1914 however, the theater moved and left the building empty, it was then destroyed by fire in the 1930’s.\nThe second opera house, built in 1906, was owned and operated by F.B. Hodgkinson and was named the Grand Opera House, but mostly known as the Hodgkinson’s Opera House. On opening night “Nature’s Nobleman” was performed by the Kerkhoff-Hillman Company. Perhaps the most famous actor to perform on the Goodland Opera House’s stage was Milburn Stone, who would later become Doc on the show “Gunsmoke.” The picture on the left shows the cast of an opera house production.

Several more attempts to revive the business were for naught: the Opera Café and alley businesses were no more. An ordinance proposed by Alderman C.D. Gould went into effect on December 1, 1911, limiting the number of saloons to 408 and banning alley saloons outright. By the end of the year, dispensing liquor in alley establishments was effectively illegal. Also made illegal was the sale of malt in pool or billiard rooms, much to the detriment of a small-time pool hall operator at 29 Palace Court.\nAftermath, Swindle, and Fake Horse Races: the “Turf Exchange”\nNewspaper accounts of commercial activity in Palace Court went dormant after the Gould Ordinance. After Alderman DeLaittre proposed naming the alley in 1913, the concept was backed by the Civic and Commerce Association. And yet, City Council did not take up the issue with a vote, perhaps hoping that Palace Court would go away all together. (Conversely, during the same year, an alley one block to the north was officially named “King’s Court” to honor the late William S. King.) The only notable activity in the alley’s afterglow was an elaborate wiretapping scandal, which occurred in a place called “The Turf Exchange,” located in the old Opera Café space at 40 Palace Court. In 1914, Charles Carlson and Edward Dixon used a fake pool room to swindle E.W. Coyle of Mason City out of $5000 (equivalent to nearly $142,000 in 2022 dollars). Coyle was led to the second floor of the building and engaged in a wiretapping scheme for a fake horse race, before he was assaulted and locked out of the front door. Another man won a judgment in his favor against Dixon, when a fight was staged after he put up $5000 for winning twice that amount.

However, by the time it opened in late 1913 it had been renamed as the Tivoli Theatre. At that time, the theatre seated 2170 patrons and was regarded as the finest theatre in Australia.

Insull insisted that opera must be democratized, that its supporters should be found in the telephone directory rather than the social register. As a result of this goal, he reduced the number of boxes and placed them in the rear. He did not want the fine clothes and jewels of society people to detract from the performance on the stage.

Iconic releases in ’95, ’96, ’97 and ’98 saw ambient music meld effortlessly with electronica, offering a vintage, warm sound that felt like it had been around for years. The elusive Scottish pairing are solely responsible for the biggest cult of fans within the ambient & electronica genres (second to Aphex Twin maybe). Much like their music, their unique, mysterious ways are still going strong to this day and although many purists would argue until they are white in the face that they aren’t ambient, there’s no doubt they’ve played a massive part in inspiring and making the ambient sound more appealing to others.\nAlongside BoC, the late 90’s witnessed Stars of The Lid progress the beautiful drone soundscapes which are so popular in today’s ambient music. Brian McBride and Adam Wiltzie are often included amongst the best-of ambient lists and their pedigree shows to this day with Adam Wiltzie going strong as part of A Winged Victory For The Sullen.

Perhaps this train of thought is new to many, or some don’t want to be associated with a genre which is now quite frankly, an embarrassment and laughing stock to anyone over 18 years of age. But the true Trance era (say pre-2002) was undoubtedly an offshoot of some of the best psychedelic ambient productions, and helped define the true meaning of chill out before it was commercialised by the likes of Ministry of Sound and Hed-Kandi and ultimately generalised into EDM.", "score": 0.832092881, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:e8f79e7f-6d77-4de3-a284-418937a87cf4>", "text": "While not as celebrated as his ambient music debut, Brian Eno’s Ambient 4: On Land is the first record to significantly explore the influences of land and place in ambient composition. It’s also a record that captured a distinct sense of the “eerie”, as cultural theorist Mark Fisher recently observed.\nBest remembered for their publicity stunt involving the burning of a million pounds, The KLF’s Chillout typified ambient’s rising popularity and shift into the mainstream early in the 1990s. Indeed at that time, the term was overused to the point where its meaning became opaque at best. Chillout spaces dotted most raves and other underground dance parties, providing music that expressly shunned hard rhythms and fast beats per minutes.\nThomas Köner’s Permafrost spearheaded a new, so-called isolationist thread of ambient music, one concerned with icy sound fields and harrowing, low-frequency explosions, which felt like the listener was tapping into the songs of tectonic plates.\nIf there’s one record that solidified ambient’s continued relevance into the 1990s, it was Aphex Twin’s Selected Ambient Works Volume II. It remains a touchstone for the more accessible end of the genre, a gently sweeping collection of warm harmonic phrases washing over pulsing bass lines and filtered downtempo grooves.\nWith the simple introduction of a pulsing kick drum, Wolfgang Voight (under the moniker Gas, perhaps a reference to ambient’s nebulous musical form) marked out a new territory for the music with a series of recordings including Königsforst. In this fresh terrain, a low-frequency heartbeat could pump energy through uneasy clouds of sound and melody.\nWilliam Basinski’s extended work Disintegration Loops stands as one of the most quietly powerful executions of ambient music this century. With the literal sound of magnetic materials falling off decaying tape loops, the singular simplicity of this work never fails to astound.\nWhilst her work exists in excess of what some might consider ambient music, Éliane Radigue’s L'île re-sonante crystallises so much about the capacity of the genre to be deeply affecting without becoming didactic in any way. Radigue’s pieces, which often drew from her interest in Buddhist philosophy, were largely made with the legendary Arp 2500 synthesizer, which was adept at creating wavering electronic tones.\nGrouper’s Dragging A Dead Dear Up A Hill is another record that recontoured the boundaries of ambient.", "score": 0.831066787, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:120d12d8-cb3d-4833-88ca-b7c923d64255>", "text": "With the posthumous release of Emotional Engramm in 1997, Maeror Tri's compositional complexity began to blossom, relying less on the hypnogogic dislocation of time-lag effects and more on the poetics and the portent of the underlying melodies that rippled through their ghostly accretions for drone and noise. Right as they called it quits, the ideas of Maeror Tri had expressed a maturity that had much more to say through the collapse of sound into an crushed, all-encompassing, cathartic tsunami.\nWhat was to emerge in the wake of Maeror Tri's dissolution did not immediately seem clear. Founding member Stefan Knappe had already established his impeccably curated Drone Records, which initially focused on the improbable medium of the 7\" single to release long-form works of dark ambient, heavy drone, and industrial din. Many of these artists that landed on Drone were unknown or under-appreciated projects, but without fail, these proved to be impressive documents and demanded that they be acquired upon sight with or without any idea of who exactly was behind the project. In this series, Knappe did commisson work from a number of highly acclaimed musicians including Inade, Francisco Lopez, Cranioclast, Aidan Baker, The Lotus Eaters, etc. but there were the lesser known acts such as the Hungarian experimental project Hideg Roncs, Holland's esoteric ambient outfit Indra Karmuka, and the hermetic tape machinist Abner Malaty. Drone released exactly 100 singles between 1993 and 2010, at which time the format switched to a four-way split LP format under the Drone-Mind // Mind-Drone banner, in addition to the 10\" Substantia Innominata series, both of which maintain high calibre curation to this day.\nIn 1998, Knappe reconvened with fellow Maeror Tri member Martin Gitschel to form Troum. The name for this new project was taken from an archaic German word for dream and provides clear insight into their investigations manifesting universal archetypes and symbols from a collective unconsciousness into an overwhelming flood of sound. The first recordings for Troum were published on a small cassette housed in a small pillow, ascribed with the title Dreaming Muzak.", "score": 0.829233825, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:600ac93a-fb24-4c0b-bfdd-89d10b6644ed>", "text": "Why do you think there’s been a resurgence of interest in Japanese ambient music from the 80s? What do you think this cultural shift in interests signifies?\nA lot of these records were hardly accessible outside of Japan before the internet. I feel that a lot of people who are interested in Japanese ambient, electronic, experimental music from the 80s and 90s are people who probably grew up digging through all the music they could reach within their parts of the world. From a Western point of view, getting records from Japan was extremely complicated back then. Aside from very few record stores importing selected releases, you had to go there, or have friends bring back records. But how could you learn about a whole scene based there? How could you discover complete discographies from local artists? You would probably have had to live in Japan.\nThe internet gave us access to an immense archival database for music, access to the knowledge of people for every corner of the globe through blogs, message boards, YouTube and Discogs. I think the first phase for music enthusiasts was completing their knowledge of genres they were familiar with, of music from countries they had been researching before.\nWhen I think of why I got so excited when I heard, say, something like Jun Fukamachi’s Nicole or Satoshi Ashikawa’s Still Way or Hiroshi Yoshimura’s Green for the first time, I keep going back to my childhood and the shock – and I mean the best kind of shock – of hearing Run DMC, LL Cool J, Public Enemy or the Beastie Boys in the 80s the first time I travelled to the US.

The first ambient psychedelic rock band was Magic Carpathians, formed in Poland in 1993. The genre has since grown in popularity, with bands like Spacemen 3, The Orb, and Boards of Canada becoming well-known names in the music world.\nThe influence of Psychedelic Rock\nIn the late 1960s and early 1970s, a new type of rock music emerged that had its roots in the psychedelic rock of the late 1960s. This new style of music, which came to be known as ambient psychedelic rock, blended elements of psychedelia with other genres such as electronica, ambient, and world music.\nPsychedelic rock was a product of the countercultural movement of the 1960s, which saw young people experimenting with mind-altering drugs such as LSD and marijuana. The use of these drugs often resulted in distorted perceptions of reality, which were reflected in the music of psychedelic rock bands such as The Grateful Dead and Jefferson Airplane.\nThe Grateful Dead’s music was particularly influential on the development of ambient psychedelic rock. The band’s use of long jams and extended improvisation helped to create a musical style that was both psychedelic and hypnotic. This sound was later perfected by British band Pink Floyd on their landmark album The Piper at the Gates of Dawn (1967).\nOther important early proponents of ambient psychedelic rock include German band CAN, Japanese musician Hiroshi Yoshimura, andBritish band Spacemen 3. These artists all helped to develop the genre’s distinctive sound, which combines elements of psychedelia, electronica, and global sounds.\nIn recent years, ambient psychedelic rock has seen a resurgence in popularity thanks to bands like Tame Impala and MGMT. These bands have taken the sound of early ambient psychedelic rock and updated it for the 21st century.\nThe influence of Ambient Music\nThe origins of ambient psychedelic rock can be traced back to the late 1960s and early 1970s, when artists like Brian Eno and Pink Floyd began experimenting with new ways of creating music.", "score": 0.827123344, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:3698ca57-a1dd-43fc-bfbe-b320c7c21657>", "text": "Rabbit In The Moon, Humate, BT, William Orbit, The Art of Trance, even Tiesto (yes, just listen to his late ’90′s work as Kamaya Painters and Gouryella) and labels such as Hooj, Platipus, Lost Language, and Bonzai were responsible for some of my favourite trance music in the 1990’s and in particular, a trend which emerged to be most relevant to this article; the ambient remix. Whilst this may send shudders down many ambient fans spine, I have no shame in admitting how much I enjoyed some of the remixes to emerge from trance music in the late 1990’s and early 2000’s. The ambient remix of Pete Lazonby’s Sacred Cycles (sampling Genesis no-less) and Energy 52′s Cafe Del Mar, remixed by Michael Woods (2000) come straight to the top of the pile and this compilation by Solar Stone (2001) encapsulates some the best remixes to emerge (ironically including Tangerine Dream’s Love On A Real Train).\nI won’t dwell on it here, as you’ll know by now i’m a closet trance fan, but I still visit the likes of Salt Tanks Sargasso Sea, Chicane’s Far From The Maddening Crowds and Way Out West’s debut album on a regular basis.

Ambient music is said to evoke an \"atmospheric\", \"visual\", or \"unobtrusive\" quality. According to Brian Eno, one of its pioneers, \"Ambient music must be able to accommodate many levels of listening attention without enforcing one in particular; it must be as ignorable as it is interesting.\"\nAs a genre, it originated in the United Kingdom at a time when new sound-making devices were being introduced to a wider market, such as the synthesizer. Ambient developed in the 1970s from the experimental andsynthesizer-oriented styles of the period. Mike Oldfield, Jean Michel Jarre, and Vangelis, as well as the psychoacoustic soundscapes of Irv Teibel's Environments series, were all influences on the emergence of ambient.Brian Eno popularized ambient music in 1978 with his landmark album Ambient 1: Music for Airports.\nDeveloping in the 1970s, ambient stemmed from the experimental and synthesizer-oriented styles of the period. Although German bands such as Popol Vuh and Tangerine Dream predate him in the creation of Ambient music, Brian Eno played a key role in its development and popularization and is often cited as ambient's founder. The concept of background or furniture music had already existed some time before, but only in the 70s was ambient music first created, which incorporated New Age ideals with the newly invented modular synthesizer. The impact the rise of the synthesizer in modern music had on ambient as a genre cannot be overstated; as Ralf Hutter of early electronic pioneers Kraftwerk said in a 1977 Billboard interview: \"Electronics is beyond nations and colors...with electronics everything is possible. The only limit is with the composer\". Similarly, Eno said in a 2013 interview with The Guardian that \"One of the important things about the synthesizer was that it came without any baggage. A piano comes with a whole history of music...when you play an instrument that does not have any such historical background you are designing sound basically. You're designing a new instrument. That's what a synthesizer is essentially. It's a constantly unfinished instrument.

Partly it’s to do with cycles: the ’90s revivalism that has people digging for old house, techno and jungle has created a context where the excesses of the chill-out room no longer seem that silly. The fact that both noise scene musicians and crate digger culture have increasingly alighted on new age music over the past few years has helped.

And the ’90s stuff itself has had plenty of attention: witness the humungous 8CD box set put together to commemorate the life of the late Pete Namlook last year.\nCertainly my personal experience has been that I can get bookings to play beatless sets more and more easily (*SPAM*: Londoners, come and see me at the Ace Hotel Shoreditch on Tuesday, October 21). There are more festivals like Unsound and the LCMF which blur the boundaries between avant-garde, academic worlds and more pleasure-centred scenes; at Sónar you can witness things like a large auditorium full of people lying flat on the floor to appreciate the sound of Bee Mask; and something is in the air regarding increased interest in ultra-detailed, ultra-immersive soundsystems: see Despacio, the Bowers & Wilkins dome, the Sonos Studio, Spiritland, and above all the mind-frying 4D Sound system.\nOn top of that, a lot of people are making great new ambient music.

(Gratuitous gossip: the cover shot of that album, taken minutes before the gig began, shows Ayers and Cale in an apparently relaxed, brotherly pose. The night before, however, Cale had caught Ayers having sex with his, Cale’s, wife. The show must go on).\nAmbient 1: Music for Airports\nEno used the term ambient music to distinguish it from canned background-music such as Muzak. In his liner notes for this album, he wrote that while canned music regularised environments by smothering their acoustic and atmospheric idiosyncrasies in an audio comfort-blanket, ambient music was intended to subtly accentuate those idiosyncrasies. Eno has described ambient music as “rewarding attention but not being so strict as to demand it” – a definition which also highlights ambient’s key difference to new-age music, whose lack of substance is revealed if attention is given to it.\nAmbient 1 was performed mainly by Eno (Robert Wyatt guests on piano on one track and there is a female vocal-trio on three) and mainly on electronic instruments. By contrast, another recommended album in the series, Ambient 3: Days of Radiance, featured the American zither player Laraaji, with minimal sound or tape manipulation by Eno.\nBrian Eno – David Byrne\nMy Life in the Bush of Ghosts\nA forerunner of the so-called “world-music” which emerged later in the 1980s, the breathtakingly novel My Life in the Bush of Ghosts combines Eno’s ambient aesthetic with the culturally inclusive music of another collaborative album, Fourth World Vol. 1: Possible Musics, made by Eno with the trumpeter Jon Hassell and released in 1980.\nBuilt on rock and funk foundations, and laced with Byrne’s singular take on gospel music, My Life in the Bush of Ghosts overlaid a variety of non-Western styles, notably from North Africa and the Middle East.", "score": 0.823486626, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:30a4bcfe-5131-4141-9215-ef95486c8d1a>", "text": "Yeah well… datz tha pinch ovv guilt i get wen i aint duin summin right…. while evry else in sch now, here i am….. oh wow….. partly cuz i needed sum rest afta all those sleepless nightz n restless morningz n lethargic moodz… *groan* n anotha reason iz dat i havent completed ma Bio report!

What this means is that there is nothing wrong with having problems, only with thinking that you shouldn’t have any problems. So one could say that the only real problem is dysfunctional thinking, the rest are challenges, not problems. This isn’t just playing around with semantics.

The characters get challenged, the plot becomes interesting. If nothing “goes wrong”, we go to sleep or walk out of the cinema and ask for our money back. So why do we complain when things “go wrong” in real life? It’s not “wrong” at all. It’s called life!

Only a minority of MS lesions remyelinates completely. Enhancing remyelination is, therefore, a major aim of future MS therapies. Here we took a novel approach to identify factors that may inhibit or support endogenous remyelination in MS. We dissected remyelinated, demyelinated active, and demyelinated inactive white matter MS lesions, and compared transcript levels of myelination and inflammation-related genes using quantitative PCR on customized TaqMan Low Density Arrays. In remyelinated lesions, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 1 was the most abundant of all analyzed myelination-regulating factors, showed a trend towards higher expression as compared to demyelinated lesions and was significantly higher than in control white matter. Two MS tissue blocks comprised lesions with adjacent de- and remyelinated areas and FGF1 expression was higher in the remyelinated rim compared to the demyelinated lesion core. In functional experiments, FGF1 accelerated developmental myelination in dissociated mixed cultures and promoted remyelination in slice cultures, whereas it decelerated differentiation of purified primary oligodendrocytes, suggesting that promotion of remyelination by FGF1 is based on an indirect mechanism. The analysis of human astrocyte responses to FGF1 by genome wide expression profiling showed that FGF1 induced the expression of the chemokine CXCL8 and leukemia inhibitory factor, two factors implicated in recruitment of oligodendrocytes and promotion of remyelination. Together, this study presents a transcript profiling of remyelinated MS lesions and identified FGF1 as a promoter of remyelination. Modulation of FGF family members might improve myelin repair in MS.\nSteun ons werk\nDe Stichting Vrienden van het Herseninstituut ondersteunt baanbrekend hersenonderzoek.

(For more information on sooty mold, refer to Scale insects and mealybugs on ornamental plants.)\nFeeding under and adjacent to the button of oranges results in fruit drop, reducing crop yields. Oranges develop hard lumps as a result of mealybugs feeding, resulting in discolored and poor quality fruit. Development of sooty mold on the fruit leads to commercially unacceptable appearance of fruits and requires vigorous scrubbing before packing the fruits. If not removed from the fruit after harvest, the remaining mealybugs continue to breed, causing loss during transit and storage (Griffiths and Thompson 1957).\nPopulation Dynamics: Mealybugs are most common during the spring and early summer. Several overlapping generations occur in a year, but only one cycle (Spring-Summer) is of major concern to citrus growers in Florida, with peak infestations occurring in June or July. With the advent of the rainy season and warm weather, populations rapidly decline. In grapefruit groves, mealybugs persist in high numbers throughout the summer and into the fall. Reproduction in the greenhouse can occur year round, leading to continuous populations of mealybugs (Griffiths and Thompson 1957).\nSpread: Dispersal of citrus mealybugs may occur through active or passive modes. In addition to actively crawling between trees, the insects may be transported by wind, on bird’s feet, or by machinery and labor crews (Kerns et al. 2001).

The longtailed mealybug, Pseudococcus longispinus, is a little different from the citrus mealybug in that instead of laying eggs, females bear live young like greenhouse-dwelling aphids. They are visibly different from citrus mealybugs because of their grayish color and long waxy filaments (tails) that are longer than the length of the mealybug’s body.\nObscure mealybug. The obscure mealybug, Pseudococcus viburni, resembles the citrus mealybug but lacks the stripes down the back and has a purple to clear body fluid. It also has long tail filaments, but they are only about half the length of the body or slightly longer. Obscure mealybug females cover most of their body and eggs with the cottony ovisac.\nMadeira mealybug. The Madeira mealybug is a relatively new pest that is spreading across the country. It is exceptionally difficult to control with insecticides, and it may be suggested that if you are having problems with mealybugs now, whereas in the past they were more easily controlled, it well might be that this new species has displaced the more easily controlled population. Ron Oetting from the University of Georgia says that it is probably the most serious pest they have had to deal with in Georgia in many years. This mealybug appears to be very tolerant of most of the insecticides registered for mealybug use.", "score": 0.815435, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:e972de51-bc02-4d4d-b67d-63188d56a554>", "text": "California Valley Guards Against Citrus Disease\nRENEE MONTAGNE, HOST:\nCertain bugs might be a tasty treat or might not, but others are a serious threat, which brings us here to Los Angeles, and our last word: alien versus predator.\nA quarantine zone has been set up in the San Gabriel Valley after a lemon tree was found infected with a disease carried by a bug called the Asian citrus psyllid.

Best known is the seven-spot ladybug, the shiny red bug with black spots on its back beloved by many. Kids like them because they’re cute, but gardeners appreciate this iconic garden visitor for another reason. While most are omnivores and may snack on a bit of plant matter here and there, salad is not the main dish for these seemingly gentle creatures. Other bugs are. Turns out, ladybugs are stone cold killers, and we couldn’t be happier.\nThere are a few species of lady beetles that are indisputably considered garden pests. The Mexican bean beetle, for example, destructively devours leaves, flowers and developing bean pods in the garden. Most though, including the iconic seven-spot, are are welcome guests for home growers, often referred to as \"the gardener’s best friend.\" Considered beneficial bugs, these friendly looking beetles are voracious predators, consuming pesky garden pests by the thousands.\nAlthough ladybugs are tiny, ranging from just 1 to 10 mm, tinier still are their prey. Aphids may be small, but in large numbers they are prodigious plant eaters, sucking the sap from the leaves and often destroying crops before effective treatments can be employed. Fortunately, in a garden with a healthy ladybug presence, when it comes to aphids and other small plant killers like whiteflies, mites, cabbage moths and mealybugs, pesticides may become unnecessary. The extermination of these pests is the lifelong goal of the ladybug.\nLadybugs live an average of 3 to 6 weeks, but they pack a lot of living (and a lot of eating) into those few weeks. One ladybug will lay up to a thousand eggs in those weeks. Eggs are laid on the underside of leaves to protect them from predators, but it also happens to be a popular hangout for aphids and other sap-sucking insects. From the moment a ladybug larvae emerges, it will begin consuming aphids or mites at an astonishing rate. By the time its short life comes to an end, the average ladybug may have eaten as many as 5,000 aphids.\nThe insatiable appetite of ladybugs make them a very beneficial bug indeed.", "score": 0.812851429, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:36b801bf-9a2a-4d2f-a828-c33d37fcadfe>", "text": "Tutor profile: Marianela V.\nConjugate the verb \"to eat\" in Spanish.\nComer Yo como Tu comes Usted come El come Ella come Ellos comen Nosotros comemos Ustedes comen Vosotros comeis\nSubject: Basic Chemistry\nWhat is the difference between inorganic and organic elements?\nOrganic elements such as: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, etc; make up the chemistry of living cells.

It has been recognized as a difficult-to-control pest in Europe since 1813 (where it is called the greenhouse mealybug) and in the United States since 1879 (Anonymous 2007).\nThe pest is a native of Asia but is also found throughout the Americas, Europe, and Oceania. In North America, it is present in both Mexico and the United States (Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, California, Florida, Hawaii, Kansas, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts, Missouri, New Mexico, Ohio, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia) (CABI/EPPO 1999).\nEggs: Eggs are deposited as white, cottony masses, called ovisacs, on the trunk and stems of citrus plants, giving the appearance of cotton spread on the plant (Figure 1). The glossy, light yellow eggs are oval and approximately 0.3 mm long. A female can lay from 300 to 600 eggs in her lifetime, which are deposited in groups of five to 20. Depending on the season, egg hatch may occur after six to 10 days or several weeks. Female lay an average of 29 eggs per day (Kerns et al. 2001, Meyers 1932).\nFigure 1. Eggs are deposited as white cottony masses called ovisacs. Photograph by Lyle J. Buss, University of Florida.\nImmatures: Nymphs emerge from the ovisacs and typically settle along midribs and veins on the underside of leaves, young twigs, and fruit buttons. They can also be found where two fruits are touching each other (Figure 2) or on leaves clinging to fruits. Due to their habit of hiding in crevices, light infestations are easily overlooked. Wax and honeydew secreted by crawlers are visible indicators of infestations. First instar female and male nymphs are called crawlers. The nymphs take six to 10 weeks to reach maturity.", "score": 0.812101185, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:305c650e-cfad-4295-a0af-3e40b3b9e86c>", "text": "I have 3 citrus plants which I have overwintered in my conservatory.

These can be leafy plants as well as fruits and seeds. Such animals have different teeth, customized to eat plants. These are broad and flat with dull edges so that these animals can grind up the plants easily and consume them without hassle. Such animals also have blunt and flat hooves that they use to travel on mushy and soft terrain.\nWhat are Carnivores?\nCarnivores are animals and plants that only consume meat. They hunt down other animals and eat their flesh while some prefer devouring them whole. Carnivores have very sharp teeth that they use to tear through skin and meat with ease. They also have very sharp claws, since this helps them latch on to their prey and also to take the carcasses apart.\nThere are some carnivorous plants as well which are known as insectivorous plants as they consume insects. One such plant is the Venus flytrap.\nWhat is the difference between Herbivores and Carnivores?\nHerbivores and carnivores are quite different from one another, but they both refer to animals and what they consume in order to create energy that is required for their survival. They are both important categories of animals that help maintain balance in nature.\n• Herbivores only eat plants.

Martin, Educational Specialist\nRonald F.L. Mau, Extension Entomologist\nDepartment of Entomology\nUpdated by: J.M. Diez April 2007\nThe citrus mealybug is a minor pest on annona, arabica and robusta coffee (young trees are occasionally killed), cotton, and various vines. Other crops attacked are banana, carambola (starfruit), cocoa, flowering ginger, macadamia, mango, and plants belonging to the Citrus genus.\nThe citrus mealybug is one of the most common mealybugs. This pest has a pan tropical distribution that sometimes extends into subtropical regions. It is present in nearly all coffee growing countries.\nThis insect has two forms, a root form that attacks the roots of its host and an aerial form that attacks the foliage and fruit. Leaves of plants attacked by the root form wilt and turn yellow as if affected by drought. Roots are sometimes encrusted with greenish-white fungal tissue (Polyporus sp.) and stunted. Citrus mealybugs are visible beneath the fungus when it is peeled away. When the root form is associated with fungal tissue, it is capable of killing the plant. The aerial form of this insect is found on leaves, twigs, and at the base of fruits.\nThis mealybug is a vector of Swollen Shoot Disease of cocoa.\nBased on laboratory studies on coffee leaves, male citrus mealybugs live (hatching to adult death) for approximately 27 days, and the females live for approximately 115 days.\nLife cycle duration (egg to egg-laying adult) ranges from 20 to 44 days (Betrem, 1936). Citrus mealybug populations are generally composed of equal numbers of males and females.\nEggs are laid in groups covered by ovisac wax threads. Eggs hatch in 2-10 days.\nMale citrus mealybugs have 4 nymphal stages called instars.

The timing is very punctual, and the staff will help set up the floating breakfast so you don’t have to worry about a thing! The breakfast was delicious and there are plenty of tissues available so you can swim and enjoy the food whilst not dirtying the pool. Whats best is that the tray is so light that you can move it around easily – I recommend the floating breakfast for everyone to try at least once! You can get some good instagram opportunities, and plus it’s fun to actually eat breakfast in the pool haha.\nDuring our stay we also decided to have an outdoor citrus bath. When it came to organise the citrus bath, we didn’t know just how much work goes into it! It takes about 45 mins alone just to set up, so I recommend letting them know to organise it in advanced. I estimate that there were about 40 cucumbers and 20 oranges at least that went into the citrus bath. It’s not just great for photos, but a citrus bath can also be very detoxifying to your body after a long day. I certainly felt refreshed and relaxed after 15 mins of soaking but just be careful because after too long, your skin might burn a little due to the citrus!\nI thought the stay at Leigan Kriyamaha Villas was unparalleled and definitely one that prides themselves on excellent guest service.

The diagnosis can feel overwhelming regardless of the severity of the condition. Patients of New York City Mohs surgeon Dr. Adelle Quintana can gain peace of mind knowing their physician has the up-to-date training to manage even the most visible skin cancer lesions. In our office, we know that skin cancer can be a serious diagnosis. That is why we work quickly in the area of treatment planning, and why Mohs surgery is often our go-to procedure.\nVisible Skin Cancers\nAny skin cancer is a concern. However, due to the potential need for reconstruction, visible skin cancers present a unique situation. If your skin cancer is located on your chest, nose, or another part of the neck or face, scarring may be a concern that floats around in your mind. Mohs is an excellent option for visible skin cancers due to the minimally invasive methodology involved in the removal of abnormal lesions. In addition to the low scarring risk, Mohs is also known for its high success rate for full elimination of cancer cells.\nProgressive Improvements in Care\nHistorically, skin cancer removal has been conducted with surgical removal or standard excision. The Mohs technique is different. It is referred to as micrographic for a reason. During the mid-1900s, Dr. Frederic Mohs developed the technique for progressive removal of cells. By removing a thin layer of cells, that layer of tissue can be immediately examined. That means no waiting days for a lab to return the “all clear.” It also means the greatest amount of preservation of healthy tissue and the highest accuracy.\nThe meticulous process of removal and examination is advantageous not only for reconstructive purposes but also regarding the depths reached in a single procedure. Unlike standard excision, Mohs is adept at reaching deep roots without necessarily creating a large wound to do so. While the process does take longer, most patients agree that the peace of mind they gain knowing their physician has successfully removed all cancer cells from a lesion is well worth a day in the office.\nDo you need information regarding removal of a visible skin cancer?

Luckily, with a little knowledge it can be identified and treated early.\nTypes of Skin Cancer\nThere are many terms to describe the different types of skin cancer that can occur. For ease of understanding, we can simplify all of these types of skin cancer into three categories:\n- Basal Cell Carcinoma\n- Squamous Cell Carcinoma\nBasal Cell Carcinoma\nBasal cell carcinoma is the most common and the least aggressive of the three main categories of skin cancer. Basal cell carcinoma arises from the deepest part of the upper layer of the skin (epidermis). This type of skin cancer can be treated chemically (without surgery) or by standard surgical removal. Surgical removal only requires a very small amount (about 1 mm) of normal skin to achieve high cure rates. Basal cell carcinoma rarely spreads (metastasizes) beyond the actual tumor and therefore treatment does not need to be aggressive to achieve a cure.\nSquamous Cell Carcinoma\nSquamous cell carcinoma is the second most common type of skin cancer. This type of skin cancer also arises from the epidermal layer of the skin. Squamous cell carcinoma is more aggressive than basal cell carcinoma. It does have the possibility to spread beyond the borders of the tumor (metastasize). Treatment can still be done chemically or surgical removal. When possible, direct excision for single or few tumors is ideal. Margins of normal skin should be around 3mm on average.\nMelanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer. The tumor arises from melanocytes or pigment producing skin cells. Melanoma is often black or purple in color but also can occur in a variety of other colors including pink and white. When caught early, melanoma is easily curable. Signs of identifying early melanoma tumors often include:\n- Irregular borders\n- Irregular color\n- Irregular or asymmetric shape\n- Greater than 5mm\nSurgical treatment for melanoma is recommended. The amount of normal skin around the tumor that should be excised depends on the depth of the melanoma noted on biopsy.\nCauses of Skin Cancer\nA combination of genetics and environmental exposure are the main causes of skin cancer. Of the environmental sources of skin cancer, sun exposure is by far the most common source overall.", "score": 0.007110813933783874, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:7a059aad-d2f6-40fe-8d55-6166fe389093>", "text": "Advantages of Laser Hair Removal\nLaser hair removal is a popular and quick treatment.

Insurance does typically cover these procedures, however they must be prior authorized.\nFat grafting is used to help add an extra layer of tissue to help improve symmetry that cannot be improved via implants alone. Because there is no breast tissue left to cover the implants, there can sometimes be some divoting or rippling visible through the skin. Fat grafting involves removal of fat from areas such as the stomach, love handles or inner thighs and injection of this fat into the skin of the breast overlying the implants to help thicken the layer of tissue and hide the implant better.\nNipple and areolar reconstruction can be done in many ways. The most common is to build a nipple bump out of the skin on the front of the reconstructed breast, then have the areola tattooed. The areola can also be reconstructed with a skin graft from the inner thigh or lower abdomen. We commonly fat graft as well underneath the nipple reconstruction to give a more natural look to the areaola and more long term projection to the nipple reconstruction.\nAnother option gaining popularity is a 3D nipple and areolar tattoo. There are several well known artists in the country who are experts in this, and are well known for their excellent and very realistic work.\nAfter a lumpectomy and/or radiation for breast cancer\ntreatment, breast tissue can shrink or pull due to\nscarring, and can adversely affect breast symmetry to\na noticeable degree.

The placement of breast\nimplants in a radiated breast (after a lumpectomy) is\nnot typically advised because of the high risk of implant\ncomplications such as infection and capsular contracture.\nRadiation and Reconstruction\nRadiation treatment is sometimes necessary as part of breast cancer treatment, and it can affect how reconstruction is done. If implants are placed at the time of the mastectomy, radiation can be done around the implants. The radiated breast can be slightly firmer and sit higher, however with the placement of implants in front of the muscle in a pre-pectoral position this has not proven to be as much of an issue.", "score": 0.0025343335791899583, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:228b4ae6-2fe7-4690-87f0-69ebe0df2378>", "text": "The incisions are closed and no tubes or catheters stick out of the skin.\nPorts have many uses:\n- To deliver chemotherapy to cancer patients\n- To deliver antibiotics for long periods of time\n- To deliver intravenous nutrition in patients who are unable to eat\n- To deliver blood products in patients with blood diseases\n- To draw blood for tests.\nHow Does the Port Work\nThe port can be used as soon as the operation is over.

Many of us hear what we want to hear when we talk to another party who may be involved in the dispute.

Federal employment non-discrimination law, called Title VII, applies only to employers with at least 15 employees, and complaints must be filed within 180 days of the discriminatory act with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). But if you initially institute your complaint with NHCHR and indicate that you wish to have the complaint cross-filed with the EEOC, then the time limit is extended to the earlier of 300 days or 30 days after MCAD has terminated the case. (People who work for federal agencies are beyond the scope of this publication.)\nSomeone who brings a claim of discrimination may sometimes pursue protections under both state and federal law. This is true because there may be overlapping provisions of state and federal law. For example, Title VII forbids employment discrimination based on race, sex, age, religion and disability (which includes HIV status), but does not expressly forbid discrimination based on “sexual orientation” or “gender identity.”\nBecause a growing number of courts and government agencies have recognized that the root of sexual orientation and gender identity discrimination is sex discrimination, the federal EEOC has recently indicated that it will accept both “gender identity” and “sexual orientation” discrimination complaints in order to investigate whether the complainant may have experienced prohibited “sex” discrimination.

When I say “EEO,” I mean discrimination based on race, sex (now “biological sex”), national origin, color, religion, age, and “handicap.” (Ugh.) This means that if an employee wants to assert a discrimination claim against an employer, she has to either go through the EEOC charge-filing/resolution process first and then sue under federal law, or sue based on an “indirect” state-law claim, like intentional or negligent infliction of emotional distress, negligent hiring or retention, false imprisonment, assault and battery, or something else that fits the situation. A plaintiff can always combine federal discrimination and state-law tort claims in the same lawsuit, too.\nFact No. 3: HB 2 does not stick it to the plaintiff on the statute of limitations. Federal law has a fairly short time limit for filing a discrimination charge (in North Carolina, 180 days). The statute of limitations on a wrongful discharge claim is three years (1,095 days) from the date of termination. A state claim is way better, right? Usually, but not always. Even though an individual has 180 days to file the initial discrimination charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the time for filing a lawsuit is 90 days after the EEOC is done with the charge. (More precisely, 90 days after the individual receives a Notice of Right to Sue.) If the EEOC has a backlog, the 90-days-post-dismissal could be more generous than the three-years-from-date-of-termination that applies to wrongful discharge claims.\nFact No. 4: HB 2 will not necessarily result in a smaller recovery for a plaintiff who wins. Yes, compensatory (emotional distress) and punitive damages under the federal anti-discrimination laws are capped. But punitive damages are capped under North Carolina law, too.\nIf the plaintiff wins on a federal discrimination claim, she can get back pay, back benefits, future pay, future benefits, plus up to $300,000 in compensatory and punitive damages. Under North Carolina law, a wrongful discharge plaintiff can get lost wages and emotional distress damages (not capped), plus punitive damages in appropriate cases, which are capped at three times the actual damages or $270,000, whichever is greater.", "score": 0.42402738470873796, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:42c065fd-9ca0-42c9-a6c5-268a8bbce779>", "text": "On August 29, 2013 the U.S. Department of the Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service ruled that same-sex couples, who were married under jurisdictions that recognize their marriages, will be treated as “married” for all federal tax provisions where marriage is a factor. These federal tax provisions include, but are not limited to:\n- Filing status\n- Claiming personal and dependency exemptions\n- Taking the standard deduction\n- Employee benefits\n- Contributing to an IRA\n- Claiming the earned income tax credit or child credit\nThis ruling invalidates key provisions of the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act.

This ruling applies for federal purposes, even if the couple is residing in a state where same-sex marriage is not recognized; as long as they were married in a state where same-sex marriage is recognized.\nSame-Sex Married Couples can Apply for Federal Tax Refunds\nIndividuals who have been married for one or more prior tax years that are still open under the statute of limitations (2010, 2011, and 2012) may, but are not required to, file refund claims to be treated as married couples for federal tax filing for those past years. Some married couples may have a signing agreement with the IRS, or other special cases, where they may be able to file refund claims for even more years prior.\nHow This Ruling Affects HRAs\nAs a result of this ruling, an individual enrolled in an employer-sponsored HRA can now add their federally-recognized same-sex spouse (as defined above) as a dependent on their HRA plan, if their employer allows dependents to be covered by the HRA.\nSee the official ruling here: IRS Revised Ruling 2013-17.", "score": 0.13764914769241185, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:154f8b5f-3300-4c95-803e-c519d007bf41>", "text": "To summarize our holding with regard to the applicable statutes of limitation, we repeat that the Kentucky Blue Sky law limitations period, rather than the Kentucky five-year general fraud limitations period, applies to plaintiffs' claims under Section 10(b) and 20(a) (controlling persons provision) of the 1934 Act, Section 17 of the 1933 Act, and plaintiffs' claim under the Investment Company Act. Plaintiffs' claim under Section 15 of the 1933 Act (controlling persons provision) is limited by the one-year period contained in Section 13 of the Act (controlled persons provision).\nOn June 16, 1972, the statute of limitations contained in the Kentucky Blue Sky law, KRS 292.480(3), was lengthened from two to three years. The issue is whether actions viable at the time of the amendment receive the benefit of the longer period. The district court concluded such claims were still governed by the two-year period since the appellants should have been put on notice of the alleged violations prior to the amendment. We disagree.\nClaims brought under the federal securities acts are affected by changes in the underlying state statute from which the limitations period is borrowed. See, e. g., McNeal v. Paine, Webber, Jackson & Curtis, Inc., 598 F.2d 888, 893 n.9 (5th Cir. 1979), in which the Fifth Circuit observed that \"it is undeniably untidy to insist that the statute of limitations applicable to a federal cause of action vary from time to time dependent upon changes in local law.... that circumstance, however, is an unavoidable side effect of the basic rule of requiring application of state statutes of limitation.\"\nApplication of an amendment lengthening a state statute of limitations to causes of action under the federal securities acts viable at the time of amendment is particularly suitable since the limitations period is not contained in the federal statute creating the right sued upon, so that it does not qualify the right, but only affects the remedy.17\nThe purpose of the longer limitation period is to give a person with a federal claim at least as long an opportunity to sue as a person with a state claim.

It provides access to benefits, responsibilities and protections under federal tax law that all Americans deserve,\" said Treasury Secretary Jack Lew in a statement. \"This ruling also assures legally married same-sex couples that they can move freely throughout the country knowing that their federal filing status will not change.\"\nThe ruling applies to any same-sex marriage legally entered into one of the 50 states, the District of Columbia, a U.S. territory, or a foreign country. It does not apply to registered domestic partnerships, civil unions or similar formal relationships recognized under state law. According to Evan Wolfson of Freedom to Marry, that fact in particular \"highlights the need for an America where everyone can marry the person they love in any state, and have that marriage respected at all levels of government.\"\nWith the statute of limitations for filing a refund claim set at three years from the date the return was filed and two years from the date the tax was paid, the Treasury Department says same-sex couples can still file refund claims for tax years 2010, 2011 and 2012. Moreover, some taxpayers may be able to file refund claims earlier than that depending on special circumstances, such as whether an agreement was signed with the IRS to keep the statute of limitations open.\nA release from the Treasury Department states, \"employees who purchased same-sex spouse health insurance coverage from their employers on an after-tax basis may treat the amounts paid for that coverage as pre-tax and excludable from income.\"\nThe ruling comes just over two months after the Supreme Court struck down Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act defining marriage as between a man and a woman.", "score": 0.053837380983902464, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:0874fe7e-2698-49de-88ed-296a66762329>", "text": "Here, the Fourth Circuit reversed the district court’s ruling that Bayer’s § 43(a) claims against Belmora were time-barred by nearly a decade under an analogous state statute of limitations, and ruled the equitable doctrine of laches, rather than a borrowed state of limitations, governs timeliness of this purely federal question. The Lanham Act does not contain an express limitation period for § 43(a) claims. The Fourth Circuit’s decision to apply the equitable doctrine of laches in lieu of adopting an analogous state law statute of limitations was based upon the Lanham Act, which provides § 43(a) claims for damages are subject to principles of equity and courts may grant injunctive relief to remedy § 43(a) violations according to the principles of equity.

Defendant moved for summary judgment and/or dismissal on all three counts alleging plaintiffs' ERISA claim was time-barred and that the court should not exercise pendent jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims.\nOn January 21, 1987 the state court ruled, inter alia, that plaintiffs' state law breach of employment contract and fraud and deceit claims were, in essence, claims regarding administration of an employee benefit plan and were, therefore, preempted by ERISA. The state court, however, failed to reach the last step in the analysis--whether jurisdiction over plaintiffs' particular claims was exclusively federal or concurrent. Instead, the state court dismissed the breach of contract and fraud and deceit claim on the basis that it was preempted by ERISA.\nThe state court also dismissed a portion of plaintiffs' age discrimination claim. The remaining state age discrimination claim is still pending before the state court. Plaintiffs did not, however, take an interlocutory appeal on the preemption question. The state court decision on this issue is, therefore, not final.\nOn December 17, 1988 the District Court ruled that plaintiffs had actual knowledge of their ERISA claim as early as 1982, that plaintiffs' federal action was filed outside the ERISA three year statute of limitations and that the previous filing in the Michigan state court did not toll the statute of limitations. The District Court, therefore, dismissed plaintiffs' ERISA claim as time-barred.

Since the second amended complaint was not filed until October 20, 1972, the action was barred by the two-year statute of limitations.\nThe district court determined that actions brought under Section 10 of the 1934 Act were also governed by the two-year Blue Sky statute of limitations period. The court determined that July 10, 1970 was the date by which the plaintiffs should have discovered the alleged fraud. The court based this on three events which had happened by that time. First, trading of Daniel Boone stock was suspended on July 24, 1969. Second, insolvency proceedings against DBFC were initiated in Fayette Circuit Court, Lexington, Kentucky, on June 5, 1970. Finally, the Securities Exchange Commission took action against DBFC on July 10, 1970. Although the Kentucky Blue Sky law limitations period was amended from two to three years on June 16, 1972, hence before the two-year period had elapsed, the court continued to apply the two-year period. Since the second amended complaint was filed more than two years after July 10, 1970, these claims were time barred.\nFinally, with respect to the claims brought against Dinkler as a controlling person, the district court applied the one-year statute of limitations contained in Section 13 of the 1933 Act, 15 U.S.C. § 77m. These actions were likewise time barred.\nThe first question before us is what statute of limitations applies to the various claims brought under the federal securities acts.

Sometimes, a simple misunderstanding can be rectified by open communication.\nThere are times though, when God has called you to take a stand and people simply will not comprehend it. They will not understand and it will cause them to look at you differently. Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego faced such a situation. There was no way they could agree with what King Nebuchadnezzar required of them. Their God was the one, true God and required monotheistic worship. They simply could not worship any other god and stay in right standing with their Creator. They could not straddle the fence. A stand had to be made. The result? The king’s face changed towards them.\nWhen our beliefs go against the grain of our culture, oftentimes we find people’s faces changing toward us. When we stand up against homosexuality, pornography, promiscuity, gossiping or grieving the Holy Spirit, some people simply do not understand why we are so “straight laced”. Their faces change toward us. Do we like it? No. Do we invite it? No. We simply cannot straddle the fence any longer. We must keep standing and grow deeper in our walk with Christ. We must remember First Peter 3:10-12. It says, “For the one who wants to love life and see good days must keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit, and he must turn away from evil and do what is good. He must seek peace and pursue it, because the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and His ears are open to their request. But the face of the Lord is against those who do what is evil.”\nWe obviously would rather have a human’s face turned against us than our God’s. We must pursue what is right before His eyes above all else. Many human faces may change toward us, but we must be focused on the face of our Lord.\nFor those of you familiar with what happens to Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, you remember that they were not killed in the fiery furnace and that they, in fact, regained the favor of King Nebuchadnezzar.

What often happens goes like this. People in these confessional settings look at more liberal churches who open the Table to all Christians and then reason that the result of this \"open\" communion always results in compromise and theological liberalism. The logic might seem impeccable but I do not buy it for a second. It is great so long as you stay in your small corner and I stay in mine. But in a world that is dying without Christ and in a culture where there are fewer and fewer real Christians one wonders if it is not time to seek out a new way to express our oneness within the whole family of Christ.\nI have said before that I would not try to force any congregation to admit me to the Table. I respect the Church too much to force anyone else to compromise their beliefs. But I also believe a new day is clearly coming, a day when our labels will not matter like they once did. I welcome this day. I want to first, and last, be known as a Christian, not as Reformed or Lutheran.\nI believe what will matter, and does matter, is a robust missional faith that is rooted in ecumenical orthodoxy. This would mean that Lutherans can stop framing all their theology of the Table around their reaction to the Reformed. Both can stop the polemical fracas and truly learn from one another. It would mean that groups like the LCMS will have to honestly face their diversity and welcome what the Holy Spirit is doing to unite Lutherans with other Christians. The communion issue is not, therefore, central to progress. What is central is discovering that we are already one in Jesus Christ by union with him. The sacraments are a part of vital faith, thus they are not unimportant in the least. Downplaying them is no way to go forward. But I believe that understanding them only in the strictest \"confessional\" terms is also not a option in an age where we are finding new ways to express ancient Christian faith with real theological integrity.\nA friend send me a link to the blog of an LCMS pastor named Rev.", "score": 0.16255201607102784, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:63a06316-0bfc-47d1-9df9-2fb5aa1e5407>", "text": "When you look at that particular church building, you cannot help but be overwhelmed by its beauty. Sometimes, I think about the pastor who built it and how blessed he was to be part of building something so magnificent. Just the other day, I visited a parish (St. Patrick's in Stoneham, MA) where the pastor oversaw a huge renovation of his church and built a parish center attached to it. I remember thinking, \"He ought to be really proud of the work he did here.\"\nBut, as interesting and important as these types of projects are, they are not at the heart of being a parish priest. Honestly, I rarely walk into my parish church and think, \"We did a good job painting this\" or, \"The restoration of the pipe organ sure sounds great.\" I suspect that the pastor of St. Patrick's in Stoneham probably doesn't marvel every day about the great job he did. What he probably does marvel at is what a gift he's been given in being a priest.\nWhat I most love about my parish churches are the people who fill the pews. There are events in the life of a parish priest that are way beyond cool. They are awesome. Preaching the Gospel . . . awesome. Absolving sinners . . . awesome. Offering Mass . . . awesome. Seeing a new face at Mass . . .awesome. When Jesus uses me as the instrument of drawing somebody closer to Him . . . totally awesome. Carrying the Gospel into the life of someone who is enslaved or burdened and seeing the Gospel set them free . . . what can be better than that? There is nothing more important in the world than Jesus Christ. And we priests are totally set aside to be instruments of Christ. How awesome is that?!\nThere's something that has happened to me many times in my life as a priest. In fact, it happens quite regularly. Sometimes it happens after hearing a confession or after having a conversation with somebody about a particularly difficult moral problem or life situation. It happens after being with somebody as they are dying. It happens when a young person who is confused about life and is searching for meaning seeks me out.

Because the woman saw the eternal offer that Jesus was making she was able to understand that he was the Messiah sent to redeem mankind and then spread the word to the people in her town. When the eternal message of Christ becomes the central motive for something your focus should shift away from who a person is or how they dress. This is not just in evangelism, apologetics but should also be in your daily dealings with people and with dealings with your brothers and sisters in Christ. When you look at someone and judge them just based on how they look and act you totally negate their eternality, the fact that they too have hope in Christ and our outward actions should reflect that (Ephesians 4:1-7).\nHere is my personal exhortation to you. Don’t put on your suits, your ties, your dresses, or whatever niceties you deem appropriate for a church setting. Don’t play church and put on your happy face for the hour and a half to two hours that you’re there because life just seems to fade away as you enter the doors. Don’t do that and then condescend to speak to someone like me out of some twisted obligation that you have for yourself to be nice to everyone to their face because that’s what “good Christians” do. If that’s your motivation, to focus on the external and still think you’re doing some sort of noble deed, don’t waste your time, don’t waste mine.

Likewise, there are many challenges to the Christmas mystery, not the least of which is, precisely, to be able to see the many-faced face of God in a piece of bread, a cup of water, and in our own homes and families.\nAfter the incarnation, every home is a monastery, every child is the Christ child, and all food and drink is a sacrament.\nWe struggle to believe this. For many reasons, each of us has the propensity to miss seeing God in the ordinary because we are forever searching for him in the extraordinary. We tend, nearly always, to miss the sacredness of the domestic as we look for the sacred in the monastic.\nToo often we are unaware that the incarnation fundamentally changed us from being theists to being Christians, that is, from being people who believe in God to becoming people who believe in a god who was made flesh in Christ.\nWhat’s the difference? Christmas is the difference and Kazantzakis’ parable sheds valuable light on what Christmas really means. To understand the parable of God’s many-faced face, is to understand what the very word “Christ” means.\nThe word “Christ” is not Jesus’ second name (like Jack Smith, Susan Dolenski or Jesus Christ). Christ is a title, not a name. Literally, in Greek, it means: the anointed one. Jesus Christ=Jesus, the anointed one.\nPart of the meaning of that however is that the anointed one is the one who is God-in-the-flesh, God-in-carnus. Christmas then means God-in-the-physical just as it also means that the-physical-contains-God.\nKazantzakis puts it well. In the incarnation, in the mystery of Christmas, God does become a piece of bread, a cup of water, a warm tunic, a house, a spouse and a child. God’s many-faced face is everywhere.\nWe no longer need to look for God in extraordinary visions—a sunset will do. An incarnational God normally gives precisely that kind of vision!
