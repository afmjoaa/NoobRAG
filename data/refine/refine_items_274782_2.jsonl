It has been said I possess the tenacious nature of an individual who possesses unbreakable spirit. While I do understand and perhaps even relate to this within my own experience, the feeling of being uncomfortable with the notion of this perceived reality still remains.\nThe reason for this is due to the fact that I see no difference between who is in the mirror to those that struggle and appear unable to bounce back from the density of a broken spirit. I do not consider Lloyd Roger Spencer to be special, certainly no more or less than any other human being.\nThis raises many questions because the unease and resistance felt could merely be a subtle expression of judgment on my part. Is it my own perception of what needs to be done or what serves the individual experience which causes a block? This block could be manifested by a resistance to accepting all paths, choices and current experiences being equally part of the journey of mankind.\nPerhaps the current structure of society simply creates a construct where the true qualities of individuality are not able to be explored, appreciated or expressed? Within this the nature of supposed unbreakable spirit could simply be a characteristic of individuality that becomes clearly visible due to the nature of current circumstances. The gift and ability of those who appear to be broken in spirit may not be given the opportunity to shine other monumental qualities and gifts because we do not credit or look for these potential traits. We have no time and therefore no interest because of the perceived non serving nature of the characteristics being expressed.\nAnother question always present is when will this process of individual separation via a perceived serving path of individual growth cease to be relevant? In other words when will we be able to accept and express individuality with a collective acceptance of serving processes to the human experience? Such a process would enable the exploration of feeling and human potential with a common goal to love, accept and grow as an individual who is part of a collective no greater than any of its parts.", "score": 0.821386039, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:6d8d8b65-2102-4723-a2e1-25a02e041c21>", "text": "Is this choice a narcissism or a solipsism? A nihilism? I would argue no; my perceptual experience with this work has to involve all others that participated in its making and those that are viewing it alongside me.\nIn the atrium of the Guggenheim, Turrellâ€™s Aten Reign, encourages us to sit together and decide upon the truth of what we are experiencing. This work has drawn some highly critical reception, comparing it poorly to the collective experience of Olafur Eliassonâ€™s The weather project for example. What both of these projects offer us is the sun, the ability to sit and stare at the sun, the light that burns us. â€œAtenâ€ of Aten Reign, is Aten, or Aton, the highly controversial Egyptian god of the sun and refers to the disk/orb of the sun itself. This reference to the sun brings us to another important aspect of Turrellâ€™s work: his references to the Allegory of the Cave in Platoâ€™s Republic. In this allegory, prisoners are trapped in a cave and can only see objects of the world as shadows on the cave wall â€” puppets backlit by fire controlled by puppeteers. If a prisoner is set free, her first experience of the true sun beyond the darkness of the cave is so overpowering and blinding that â€œhe [sic] will suffer sharp pains; the glare will distress [him], and he [sic] will be unable to see the realities of which in his [sic] former state he [sic] had seen the shadow.â€  This pain makes the prisoner turn away and seek refuge back in the cave where the shadows are more familiar.\nWhat Aten Reign may give us is the space to look into the light without pain. It is a foggy light and may dissemble with its changing colors, but it shows itself in such a way that maybe we can spend the necessary time with it in order to let in unveil itself. Turrell may, in a sense, occupy the position of the puppeteer, but he also opens the opportunity for us to look at the blinding light. One could argue that his skyspaces do this better, and that may be true, but they are also indirect gazes at the sun.\nI secretly took a photograph of the installation (I know I wasnâ€™t supposed to).", "score": 0.821384549, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:05f8fe56-7f9f-48f6-92fb-7febbc953958>", "text": "What separates ‘the worried well’ from the ‘social menace’?

Natural diversity is not a pathology\nHuman experience cuts deep and scatters wide. Statistically speaking, there are many shared traits, values, and approaches to life. But outliers are a fact as well.\nOur variability is to be expected. Diversity, not conformity, is the real ‘normal.’ It contributes to the robustness, resourcefulness, and creativity of our species. While it may not get you dates or jobs in a self-promoting, efficiency-driven, corporate-run economy, it is not a disorder.\nTo the contrary, it is far more like a subculture than an ‘illness.’ In actuality, scores of us value our internal experience, being true to ourselves and treating others generously. If we speak truth to power and get fired, this is not just impulsivity, mania or disorder. It’s having the courage of our convictions. We want a world that’s more than just self-promotion, might is right, and going along to get along. It’s a beautiful vision. Many of us are dying (including by suicide) for the want of it.

Conversely, collective thought (an oxymoron really) is valued whereas few care about collective comfort.\nActually it is both strange and quite sad.\nIt begets the question whether this preference is evolutionarily determined or conditioned by culture. One thing I keep wondering about is that perhaps only 10% is naturally inclined to thinking critically whereas the other 90% are mostly inclined to believe and have faith in what they are told. I can certainly see how having too many people thinking would lead to instability. Conversely, I can also see how going along also leads to a dangerous situation. Hence, there is an optimal number where a small fraction of thinking people in the population slowly adapts the entire population to new environments.\nThere is also an evolutionary concept called inclusive fitness. This can be used to tackle the comfort question. However, it is difficult to explain the widespread “F*** you, I got mine” attitude within that context.

(165)\nWhat follows is my attempt to extend the arguments of both Duckworth and Johnson, to argue that in this her final novel, Austen turns against the idea of any kind of place as a stable marker for human value. What becomes most important to Austen in Persuasion is the human element of space, especially what is authentic and valuable between two lovers, wherever they might be. Ultimately, I will suggest that Anne and Wentworth effect something of an escape from geography.\nIt’s appropriate to view Persuasion through the geographic lens because Anne Elliot is herself marked as a capable geographer of physical and social space from early in the novel. She knows that social space, unlike physical space, is relative, and knows the exact degree of difference between the status of Kellynch to its inhabitants discussing its value within the confines of its drawing room on the one hand and its status to those three miles away (the distance is marked exactly) at Uppercross. Her geographic skills are different from those of Fanny Price, whose geographic interests are brought to our attention, first in terms of her deficits (her cousins sneer because Fanny as a child thinks every island is the Isle of Wight, the only island she knows) and then later in terms of her role as arm-chair imaginist, reading in the East room about Lord Macartney’s travels to China. Unlike Fanny, Anne is a skilled geographer because she has had to be to follow the career of Captain Wentworth; she knows where the Asp and the Laconia have sailed, and where Admiral Croft has been stationed, and the byways of the Atlantic and the Mediterranean, because she has been reading the navy lists and newspapers like the Naval Gazette.1\nAnne’s skill as a geographer, then, has one purpose: to track the man she loves.", "score": 0.4866584911240649, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:a6c868d3-c4d2-4999-89f4-0a9df8306527>", "text": "This Monday, I’ll be boarding a plane for Brazil in order to attend the First International Festival of Technoshamanism, which will take place from April 23 to April 30 in Arraial d’Ajuda, Bahia.\nWhich kind of raises the question: What is “technoshamanism”?\nIt can best be described as an attempt to unite science with religion, and to integrate the worldview of indigenous peoples like the South American Indians with modern technology. It is also about finding a new way for humanity in the era we could call the anthropocene, where not only indigenous people all over the world, but practically speaking all of us arfe threatened with impending destruction.\nIn that respect, and in integrating the indigenous worldview, technoshamanism is inspired by the perspecitvism introduced by the Brazilian anthropologist Eduardo Viveiros de Castro. This includes an epistemological inversion, where the split between living, conscious human beings and the “dead” Nature inherent in European thought is replaced with a more general view of the world, where animals and things can be considered “living” and “conscious” as well, albeit usually in another way. In that sense, Viveiros’ perspectivism could be considered a formalization and generalization of an Amerindian philosophy.\nThere’s a more comprehensive explanation available in an article by Brazilian writer and pshychologist Fabiane Borges, which was the basis of her presentation at Transmediale 2014 (in Berlin). I’ve translated this article to from Portuguese to English, and it’s now available as a PDF here.\nBorges describes Viveiros’ perspectivism as follows:\nThe difference between the evolutionary and the Amerindian perspective is that the former believes that there is one nature and many cultures, while the latter thinks of it as many natures and one culture. For the Indian, the only culture that exists is human culture. Everything that exists is human. A stone, the moon, a river, a jaguar, the deceased – all of these are human, but they are dressed in different clothes, behave differently and have different views on reality. For the Indians, a meeting of shamans may mean the same thing as that of a congregation of tapirs in a mudhole – each group is performing its own rituals.", "score": 0.3838982819846507, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:9897eaad-1434-4407-8830-83fb922c0ace>", "text": "This is a game beyond dimension–the pursuit of truth.

By that time, de Waal had left the organization. Yet even before de Waal and Omaar parted ways, African Rights had become enormously prescriptive and influential; it scolded the international community about who was morally right during the war, who should be arrested and why. It staunchly defended the RPF against reports that its troops had engaged in violence and shamed other human rights investigators and journalists for calling attention to RPF abuses: “Allegations that the RPF was massacring civilians were ‘hysteria’ and journalists who ran such ‘stories’ were not doing their work properly.” Reydams aptly points out that “human rights reports usually do not defend a warring party. Yet, Death, Despair and Defiance does exactly that.

This effect goes in the expected direction; the more work-related travel, the more autonomy in work. A smaller part of the effect disappears when controlling for socio-economic position—over one fourth of the difference in autonomy between immobile\nand low/moderately mobile and 6-7 percent of the difference between immobile and highly mobile.

The 62nd (2nd West Riding) Division was one such unit, being the second line of the initial West Riding Division, the 49th. The 62nd Division was kept back for coastal defence duties until the end of 1916, when orders were received to proceed overseas, which it did in January 1917. In early February, the division was told to make itself ready for taking over trenches in the Beaumont-Hamel area of the Somme. The History of the 62nd (West Riding) Division describes the conditions:\n\"Trenches as such did not exist, for they had been obliterated by the concentrated fire of the guns......The front line was held by a series of posts which resembled islands in a sea of mud. Shell holes pock-marked the ground, often overlapping one another and where pathways existed between them they were but a few inches wide. The holes were full of water and more than one man lost his life through slipping off the pathway into the slimy mass which engulfed him.\"\nIn order to save men and materials, the German High Command decided a new trench system would be required and in September 1916 a site for this was selected about 25 miles behind their front line. This new line, known to the British as the Hindenburg Line, saved the Germans about 25 miles of front line, which would not therefore have to be manned. On 4th February 1917 the order was given by the German High Command to prepare for the withdrawal.\nThe Allies were surprised by the withdrawal and gave orders for the Germans to be harried during their retirement. The Germans were determined to give up the ground at their own pace and left behind stubborn rearguards who caused casualties to the following troops, amongst whom happened to be men from the 62nd Division.

It is first and foremost a study for navies, and only secondly a study of navies. Before 1914 naval history was not even an academic subject. Published work was driven by the requirements of naval education, doctrinal development, and strategic reflection in an age obsessed with decisive battle. Modern naval history was prompted by new shore-based officer education for mid- and senior-level officers intended to help prepare admirals who had seen no significant combat for future wars in ships that were equally untried. History was important, but only relevant history.\nIn the 19th century navies became focal points for national identity, potent mobile symbols of political and cultural power. In the process they were also shaping their own history. As naval identities became increasingly disparate, naval history would be shaped by the need to explain current strategic and policy choices. Alfred T. Mahan's historical endorsement of \"battle-fleet Sea Power\" at the U. S. Naval War College is only the best-known example of how this process affected naval history.\nMahan's friend Sir John Laughton, professor of modern history at King's College London (1885-1915), harnessed academic methods to refine the delivery of naval education and produce teaching texts. He founded the Navy Records Society in 1893 and with the Director of Naval Intelligence he persuaded officers, academics, journalists, and statesmen to adopt edited primary source material as the basis for advanced naval education. By 1914 the Society had produced forty-five volumes dealing with strategy, policy, fleet actions, and tactical thought. The most significant naval history project in the world before 1914 was driven by naval needs, expressly excluding antiquarian subjects.1 Laughton believed the university should train historians to educate the navy.\nClick for larger view\nView full resolution\nModern naval history reflects an enduring tension between the educational demands of navies, the role for which it was created, and the anxieties of an academic discipline that has not infrequently resisted the very idea of relevance. The historical profession knows that the past teaches us nothing—certainly nothing useful. Furthermore, many eminent scholars at British and American universities during the middle decades of the 20th century were distinguished émigrés from totalitarian regimes.

His first engagement was the First Battle of Ushant on 27 July 1778, and, soon afterwards transferred to the West Indies, he was present, under the command of his cousin, at all the actions which culminated in Admiral George Rodney's victory of 12 April 1782 in the Battle of the Saintes.\nAfter the peace, like many other British naval officers, Hood spent some time in France, and on his return to England was given the command of a sloop, from which he proceeded in succession to various frigates. In the 32-gun fifth-rate frigate Juno his gallant rescue of some shipwrecked seamen won him a vote of thanks and a sword of honour from the Jamaica assembly.\nFrench Revolutionary Wars\nEarly in 1793, after the outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars, Hood went to the Mediterranean in Juno under his cousin Lord Hood, and distinguished himself by an audacious feat of coolness and seamanship in extricating his vessel from the harbour of Toulon, which he had entered in ignorance of Lord Hood's withdrawal. Soon afterwards he was put in command of a squadron for the protection of Levantine commerce, and in 1797 he was given command of the 74-gun ship of the line Zealous, in which he was present at Admiral Horatio Nelson's unsuccessful attack on Santa Cruz de Tenerife. Captain Hood conducted the negotiations which relieved the squadron from the consequences of its failure.\nZealous played an important part at the Battle of the Nile.

It involved an attack on the German front line as it crossed the Ancre River, a sector of the front that had first been attacked on the first day of the battle without success. The attack along the Ancre had originally been planed for 15 October, as part of the battle of the Ancre Heights, but had been postponed repeatedly by bad weather. By November the original plan had been reducing in scope from an attempt to push the Germans back up to five miles along the Ancre to one to capture Beaucourt and push the Germans back at most two miles.\nThis was a strong sector of the German front. The first British objective involved an advance of 800 yards and would require the capture of at least three lines of trenches. The next target was the German second line, from Serre south to the Ancre. Finally it was hoped to capture Beaucourt, on the Ancre.\nThe attack would be launched by II Corps south of the river and V Corps to the north, with V Corps carrying out the main offensive. The attack immediately north of the river was to be carried out by the 63rd (R.N.) Division, under Major-General C. D. Shute. This was the first time they had taken part in an attack on the Western Front, and so extra care was taken to make sure everybody knew what was expected of them. Amongst their officers was Lieutenant-Colonel B. C. Freyberg, later to hold high command in the Second World War, who commanded the Hood Battalion (the Naval battalions were named after famous sailors – Hood, Drake, Nelson and Hawke). The division captured the German front line despite heavy German resistance.\nFurther north the attack made less progress, and so despite Freyberg’s optimism the attack on Beaucourt was delayed until the next day. 51st Division captured Beaumont Hamel, and 2nd Division managed to capture parts of Redan Ridge, but further north no progress was made.\nThe attack was renewed on 14 November.

After decades of development, countries all over the world now have incorporated both fresh and seawater environments into their economic and developmental plans in order to meet their specific needs. Advancements in underwater technology leading to the use of the aquatic beds as construction sites have put the need for underwater inspection services at an all-time high.\nWhy are Underwater Inspection Services Important?\nThere are many structures that are partially, if not completely, surrounded by water. Similar to buildings and construction above ground, subsea engineered facilities and equipment will acquire the regular wear and tear associated with daily use and exposure to the elements. Underwater edifices require regular inspection and maintenance if they are to stay within code. The best way to ensure that these structures remain within established guidelines and regulations is to have them routinely examined on a fixed schedule – this is where underwater inspection services take over.\nBy utilizing a qualified commercial inspection team, companies can ensure the safety of both its employees and its facilities. Preventing accidents by procuring minor repairs to avoid major destruction and overhauls is essential to keep any company in good standing; essentially, when used on a regular basis, underwater inspection services follow the adage “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.” The use of these highly trained crews ensures a safe work environment and keeps equipment in tip top shape.\nWhat is Included?\nBasically, underwater inspection services provide three things: one – maintain a crew of highly qualified commercial divers and engineers, two – use of both standard and sophisticated equipment to survey the site in question, and three – utilize the afore mentioned crew and equipment to quickly and safely repair any damages or impairments they find upon inspection.\nCommon Equipment Used\nThere are several elements that combine to give clients satisfactory results from underwater inspection services. One of the most important things to look for in such a company is one that is certified to use the most up-to-date equipment. Typical personnel, tools, and machines to look for are:\nCommercial Divers – depending upon what services you require, divers can be certified in not only underwater inspection, but also underwater cleaning, fish farm diving, underwater video surveillance, aquaculture diving, mooring system installation, underwater photography, search and recovery, hull cleaning, underwater mapping, civil engineering, and a host of other services.", "score": 0.9706162437858078, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:ab89cf82-4e97-4b48-b114-8d9ec99b673b>", "text": "Harbor and Marina Services\nWhat's Down There?\nThe truth is that until and unless you perform a thorough inspection to find out, you simply have no idea what's going on under the water in your harbor or marina. Erosion and corrosion could be bringing some portion of your facility to the brink of collapse. If you don't have a proactive inspection program in your facility, then the only way you'll find out is when that collapse happens. If even a single injury or property loss incident result, then the costs your facility will be facing will be orders of magnitude beyond what a proactive inspection would have cost. Wouldn't you rather know and be able to react before disaster strikes?\nHow We Can Help\nWe recommend a proactive maintenance inspection be done in two stages:\nA wide-area sonar survey of the bottom of the more open areas of your facility to look for any unknown hazards and/or problematic sediment movement. Any large, relatively unobstructed vertical surfaces like sewalls or breakwaters may also be examined in this way. This type of survey is usually done with an imaging sonar unit deployed close to the bottom from shore or a small boat.\nCloseup, detailed video and sonar inspections of critical infrastructure and detail-rich environments where wide-area techniques can't capture enough detail. Our compact, easily deployed ROV is ideal for this kind of work. Equipped with multiple cameras and scanning and multibeam imaging sonars as needed, our vehicle can pore over every detail of your facility to ensure that no problem is overlooked.\nBelow you'll find some examples of the kind of data our inspections can produce. This first image is a mosaic of several sonar scans combined with Google Earth imagery creating a seamless above-and-below the water view of a small marina.\nThe next images illustrates the general method of operation and level of detail available with typical imaging sonar equipment. In it we see the bottom and a portion of the side wall of a drydock as if viewed from above. The sonar is positioned at the center of the image. In reality, it is hanging from a tripod a couple of feet off the bottom of the drydock. It works somewhat like a lantern, shining its light in a narrow beam all around itself horizontally.

I immediately turned to my right where Nicolas, our lead software engineer, sits to start a discussion. We started talking about the various possible tools like water-resistant cameras and measuring equipment. However, the discussion evolved quickly, and we got started on the topic of safety rather than the tech involved. A few of our bigger questions were:\nWhat would happen if dangerous animals were in the water?\nWhat if someone gets injured?\nTo better understand what goes into Underwater Bridge Inspections and get the answers to our questions, we thought it would be best to talk to someone who’s been through the process and has hands-on experience.\nAlex Mocyunas is a licensed Divemaster who spent around 14 months as an assistant Underwater Bridge Inspector for the Florida Department of Transportation.\nDiving into the Engineering World\nComing from a diving background, the first thing Alex did was learn about the engineering aspect of her job as an Underwater Bridge Inspector. She received training on the engineering terminology, bridge structural aspects, various defects to look for as well as the safety measures that must be followed.\nWhen I asked Alex about the safety measures for her job, she said the most important step was studying the bridge plan before diving. On-site she is accompanied by a team of 3 consisting of two divers and one note-taker. The divers rotate between each other and whoever is not in the water acts as a rescue diver. The note-taker is a certified Bridge Engineer whose role is to record all of the information found by the divers.\nBefore diving, the team makes sure to check the surrounding area and throw rocks in the water to scare off animals. One time, Alex recalled running into an alligator mid-job and directly jumped out of the water. This caused the inspection to be delayed for 1 week.\n“A common mistake for aspiring underwater bridge inspectors is focusing on the engineering rather than the diving” - Alex Mocyunas\nWhat do you look for during an inspection?\nWe look for defects in the bridges such as cracks, spalling, vegetation, joint failure and graffiti.

Thrombolytic therapy is the most common treatment to dissolve blood clots in the brain, explains WebMD. The treatment works to improve blood flow and prevent damage to organs and tissues. Thrombolysis typically involves injections through an IV line or a long catheter to the site of the brain that is affected. The medication is designed to remove the clot or break it into pieces to dissolve the clot.\nPhysicians monitor the progression of the blood clot with an ultrasound device. Since blood clots can be life-threatening, thrombolysis is typically used as an emergency treatment to prevent the risk of strokes and heart attacks.

The most frequently reported factors included:\n• Medical team delays in diagnosing a stroke\n• Emergency treatment of a serious co-existing condition, such as high blood pressure, seizure, or low blood sugar\n• In-hospital delays\nDelays in diagnosing a stroke stalled patients' treatment by an average time of 36 minutes, while acute medical conditions delayed treatment by an average of 34 minutes.\nThe bottom line\nThe findings underscore the need to recognize stroke symptoms early and get immediate treatment.

Wikicollecting takes a look at the enduring popularity of Babe Ruth collectibles, related to this star among American baseball players.\nBackground to the Ruth legend\nBabe Ruth is revered among the greatest baseball players in history, if not as the very best of them all. He began his career as a young pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles, where he earned the nickname ‘Babe’ due to his tender age.\nRuth was sold to the Boston Red Sox in 1914, with whom he made his name as a star hitter. However, due to financial constraints (rumour has it to finance a Broadway play), in 1919 the Red Sox owner was forced to sell Ruth to the New York Yankees.\nWith the Yankees, the recognition of Ruth as a power-hitting outfielder rather than a pitcher was cemented. In his first year with the Yankees, Ruth hit 54 home runs, and batted .376. This year he also made a slugging average record at .847, which held until 2001. In his second year, his 59 home runs led the Yankees to their first league championship.\nRuth’s name became synonymous with the home run, and he hit 60 in 1927. He gained the nickname ‘Sultan of Swat’ due to his phenomenal strike rate.\nThe rest is history. After an illustrious career, Ruth was traded to the Boston Braves in 1935, retiring in 1936. He famously hit a total of 714 home runs in his baseball career.\nBabe Ruth is collected by sports fans and investors alike. His significance to sports history and also American history has not decreased with time.

He never had a season with more than 47 home runs, and only six times in his 23-year career did he hit as many as 40 long balls, but he was highly consistent, averaging 32 per season.\nMLB home run record-holders by season\nBefore Ruth came along, there was regular change at the top. No one was a prodigious power hitter like Ruth was. In baseball's first professional season, 1871, three players tied with four home runs.

Back-to-back seasons of 54 and 59 home runs in 1920 and 1921 pushed him past Connor. He was up to 162 by the end of '21. No one has held the all-time home run record longer than Ruth, at 53 years.

On the mound, he threw a complete game no-hitter—only the second by a Phillies pitcher in the last 65 years. At the plate, he homered. Twice.\nNeither achievement in and of itself makes Wise’s performance so remarkable. Plenty of pitchers have tossed no-hitters—and some have even made them perfect games. Others have homered multiple times in a game. But Wise is the only person to do both at the same time.

He first went deep in the top of the fifth with one out and a runner on second base. That turned a 1-0 lead over the Reds to a 3-0 lead. At the same time, he was pitching a perfect game, having retired the first 12 batters faced all game.\nHe retired the side again in the fifth inning: 15 up, 15 down. In the sixth inning, Wise made his only mistake of the game: a one-out walk to Dave Concepcion for the day’s only base runner.

There’s a reference to the called shot in The Sandlot, an allusion to it in The Natural, and an entire youth novel—Babe & Me—about a kid who travels back in time to witness the called shot.\nAs much as we like to remember one of the great athletes and personalities of the twentieth century calling his shot like a pool shark, in a World Series game no less, it is uncertain whether that is what Ruth actually did.\nThere is no doubt that Ruth pointed before hitting his fifth inning home run in Game 3, but it’s not clear that he was pointing at the center field wall. He may have been pointing to Root, or the scoreboard. It’s also possible that he was pointing at the Cubs dugout. Different witnesses offer different accounts of what actually happened.\nRuth’s New York Yankees easily won the American League in 1932.\nTheir 107-47 record that year was 13 games better than that of the second-place Philadelphia Athletics.

(Hornsby, however, was not easy to impress; while scouting for the Mets, the best report he could muster for any current player was \"Looks like a major-leaguer.\" The assessment referred to Mickey Mantle.) Maris downplayed the challenge, saying, \"I'm not trying to be Babe Ruth; I'm trying to hit sixty-one home runs and be Roger Maris.\" This sentiment would be echoed in 1973–1974, when Hank Aaron, in pursuit of Ruth's career home run record, said, \"I don't want people to forget Babe Ruth.

The Guinness Book of World Records did however differentiate the two records as distinct and separate for a number of years. However, Maris remained bitter about the experience. Speaking at the 1980 All-Star Game, Maris said, \"They acted as though I was doing something wrong, poisoning the record books or something. Do you know what I have to show for 61 home runs? Nothing. Exactly nothing.\" Despite all the controversy and criticism, Maris was awarded the 1961 Hickok Belt as the top professional athlete of the year, and won the American League's MVP Award for the second straight year.

On September 12, he went homer-less against the Chicago White Sox and was in the middle of a seven-game dry spell. He wouldn't hit home run number 57 until September 16 against the Detroit Tigers.\nMaris was feeling the pressure of his run on Ruth's record. Teammate Mickey Mantle also was in the chase for the record with 53 home runs, and he'd become the sentimental favorite among fans and sportswriters to break the record. But an injury would shorten Mantle's season, and he'd finish with 54 home runs.\nMaris, 26 at the time, was a quiet, no-nonsense man who'd grown up in Fargo, North Dakota. (Click here to see an essay about a family connection to Maris.) He was unaccustomed to the intense public scrutiny that came with playing baseball in New York City and was annoyed by the constant presence of reporters. He'd been labeled by reporters as surly and uncooperative during post-game interviews. He was losing sleep, and was in such a state of anxiety that his hair was falling out.\nAnd although there were still 16 games remaining on the Yankees' 1961 schedule after the game of September 12, Major League Baseball Commissioner Ford Frick announced that same day that unless Maris or Mantle hit 61 home runs by the 154th game of the season, it would not count as a new single-season record.\nThe reason for Frick's ruling was because in 1961, the American League had added two new teams and extended its season to 162 games. So Mantle and Maris would play eight more games that season than Ruth's Yankees had played in 1927.\nWhat Frick did not announce with his ruling was that he'd been a good friend of Ruth's and did not want to see the Babe's record eclipsed.", "score": 0.40767225800717055, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:5a107a8c-3ecb-4e87-891c-e6fe1e15369b>", "text": "The immortal Henry Aaron, to coin a phrase, was sitting quietly in the visitors' dugout at the Astrodome in Houston, preparing himself for another evening of being chased by Babe Ruth's ghost.

Hence, we reviewed the demographical profile along with bone marrow infiltration pattern in patients with NHL presented at Liaquat National Hospital and Medical College. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this descriptive study, adult patients with NHL were enrolled from January 2011 to December 2015. RESULTS: One hundred and Eighty-four histopathologically confirmed cases of NHL were identified. There were 139 males and 45 females, with a male-to-female ratio of 3:1. The mean age was 48.5 ± 16.0 years with the median age of 50 years. B-symptoms were present in 80.4% of patients. Lymph node enlargement was present in 71.1% of the cases. One hundred and sixty-eight patients had B-cell lymphoma (91.3%) and 16 patients had T-cell lymphoma (8.6%). Overall 158 (85.8%) patients had aggressive lymphoma. The frequency of bone marrow infiltration in our NHL patients was found to be 31.5%. Pattern of infiltrate was diffuse (14.6%) predominantly followed by interstitial (6.5%) and paratrabecular (5.4%) types of infiltration. The least common was nodular infiltrate accounted in 9 (4.8%) patients. CONCLUSIONS: B-cell lymphoma is more frequent than T-cell lymphoma. Younger age, aggressive lymphoma, and predominance of B-symptoms are more frequently seen.

Non-Hodgkin is more complicated and more threatening than Hodgkins disease. The recommended treatment for lymphoma depends on many factors such adult or childhood type. Signs and symptoms of lymphoma are generally similar for both HL and Non-Hodgkin such as swollen lymph nodes, weight loss and persistent fever.\nNonHodgkins cancer is caused by many factors such as exposure to certain herbicides and human viruses. NHL can occur at any age unlike Hodgkins. But NonHodgkins cancer is more common in people between 40 to 70 years old. In fact, about 95% of diagnosed cases occur among those in that age range.\nJust like HL, NonHodgkins is also more common in men, especially Caucasians. Since it is more aggressive and less predictable than HL, Non Hodgkin is more likely to spread beyond the lymph nodes.\nNonHodgkins is more common than HL. Non-Hodgkin cases have gone up by more than 70% over the past 20 years compared to HL which has declined during the same period.\nNonHodgkins is classified according to the cell type the cancer starts from and to how it progresses.\nProgression of Non Hodgkins lymphoma is classed into 3 grades . . .\nNon-Hodgkins can either be B cell or T cell lymphoma. 85% of diagnosed cases are B cell while 15% are T cell.

Lymphoma is a type of cancer affecting a lymphatic system consisting of lymph nodes (small closed clusters of lymphocytes), combined with small vessels.\nThe main task of the lymphatic system is to combat infections using three types of lymphocytes: T, B cells and «Natural killers». Most lymphocytes are in lymphatic nodes, but can be detected in many other parts of the body, in particular in the bone marrow, spleen and peripheral blood.\nWith a non-Hodgkin lymphoma, DNA mutation occurs in one of the lymphocytes, which leads to the appearance of a large number of poorly formed lymphocytes, struggling in tumor masses inside the lymph nodes and in other parts of the body. The exact cause of DNA mutation leading to the development of non-Khodgkin lymphoma is unknown, but under suspicion there is a number of chemicals, especially herbicides and pesticides. Most types of non-Hodgkinsky Lymph are rarely found in children, the average age of patients is 50-60 years.\nSymptoms and diagnosis of the disease\nGeneral symptoms of the disease include an increase in lymph nodes on the neck, in the area of the armpits or in the larynx. Malignant lymphocytes are blind outside the lymph nodes, as a result, subcutaneous formations are formed in bones, lungs and liver.\nThe patient makes complaints on the heat, fatigue, loss of appetite, sweat very much at night. Since the lymph nodes swell when the body struggles with infection, in itself an increase in lymph nodes cannot be considered as a sign of lymphoma. Lymphoma is diagnosed only after the biopsy (research under the microscope of the sample of lymphocytes) and identifying a significant number of affected lymphocytes. Biopsy samples are taken from lymph nodes or leather, from the lungs, liver, etc.D., That is, from there, where the lymphoma can be localized.\nTreatment of lymphoma\nThe purpose of treatment is to achieve complete remission by removing the maximum possible number of malignant lymphocytes. Two main methods of treatment - chemotherapy (radiation therapy) and bone marrow transplantation.\nAs a rule, chemotherapy includes the use of a combination of several drugs that kill malignant lymphocytes.", "score": 0.850961745, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:5f520b96-7de9-45ab-a6fc-6f25221b284f>", "text": "Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma is a type of cancer that originates in the white blood cells or lymphocytes that form a part of the immune system. It usually starts in the lymph nodes, but it can affect other parts as well. The major sites of lymph tissues are lymph nodes, spleen, bone marrow, thymus, adenoids, tonsils & digestive tract.\nDoes Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma Run In Families?\nNon-Hodgkin’s lymphoma is commonly known to affect older people in the age group of more than 50-60 years. However, it can also affect younger people. It is also more common in men than women. Having a first degree relative (parent, child or sibling) puts you at higher risk of beginning non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma; however it is not an inherited condition. No study has proven any genetic factors involved in transmission of lymphoma genes in the families. It is possible that siblings are exposed to similar conditions & illnesses that make them prone to developing lymphomas. Only 5% of lymphoma cases show any link to another family member, while non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma does not show any family link. Other risk factors for development of lymphoma are infection with Epstein-Barr virus, human T-cell lymphoma virus & human immunodeficiency virus. Chemotherapy, radiation & exposure to certain chemicals & solvents all lead to development of lymphomas.\nThe signs of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma include swollen lymph nodes in the groin, armpits, or neck which are painless, pain in abdomen or abdominal inflammation, pain in chest, cough & difficulty in breathing, fever, anemia, night sweats, severe fatigue, itchy skin & unexplained weight loss.\nDiagnosis Of Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma\nThe doctor will perform a complete physical & will look for any signs indicating non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, especially the presence of swollen lymph nodes in the underarms, groin & neck. Also abdominal examination is done to rule out swelling on the liver or spleen. Most of the times swollen lymph nodes are symptoms of infection but the cause or source of infection should be identified.\nA complete medical history is very important to eliminate out other conditions.

Your age and your general health are also taken into account. When deciding how to treat your lymphoma it is important to know how fast it is likely to grow and cause problems in your body. This is called the grade of your lymphoma.\nSome types of lymphoma grow slowly, cause few symptoms and may not need to be treated urgently. These are known as indolent lymphomas (also called low-grade lymphomas). Others grow more quickly, cause more severe symptoms and generally need to be treated soon after they are diagnosed. These are known as aggressive lymphomas (also called intermediate-grade and high-grade lymphomas).\nLow-grade lymphomas (indolent)\nMany low-grade lymphomas take years to grow, cause few if any symptoms and do not necessarily need to be treated initially. In these cases the doctor may recommend regular checkups to carefully monitor your health. If the disease is limited to a small group of lymph nodes, radiotherapy alone may be able to cure some low-grade lymphomas, or control them for a long time.\nIf the low-grade lymphoma is more widespread in the body, the decision to treat the disease or not depends on where the lymphoma has spread to, how large the spots of lymphoma are, and your general condition. In some situations chemotherapy is given, either in tablet form or intravenously. This is usually very effective and puts many patients into a remission that lasts a variable length of time. In some cases, low-grade lymphomas develop over time into more aggressive or high grade lymphomas requiring more aggressive treatment.\nIntermediate and high-grade lymphomas\nIntermediate-grade and high-grade lymphomas grow quickly and treatment is needed when they are diagnosed. If these diseases respond well to chemotherapy, they can sometimes be cured. Chemotherapy is usually combined with rituximab in B-cell lymphomas to give the best results.\nFinding out that your disease has come back (relapsed) or is resistant to standard treatment can be devastating. If your disease does relapse there are usually ways of getting it back under control. These might involve using more combination chemotherapy, or using more intensive or high dose chemotherapy followed by a bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplant.", "score": 0.849868238, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:29b15113-6588-4e82-9435-d1624d142c53>", "text": "It commonly develops in the abdomen and carries many different cell types, including large numbers of Reed-Sternberg cells.\n- Lymphocyte-depleted Hodgkin lymphoma.

Immunotherapy utilizes the body's immune system to decrease the growth of these malignant cells without the need for radiation.\nAmong the most promising developments in cancer treatment in recent years is immunotherapy. For decades, researchers have been trying to understand why the body’s immune system does not see cancer cells as foreign and attack them. Unlike chemotherapy, which attacks cancer cells, immunotherapy targets the patient’s immune system, spurring the body’s own immune function to unleash an attack on the disease. NorthShore has been an early adopter of immunotherapy, offering progressive treatment options to our patients and supporting ongoing clinical trials and research to further advance this revolutionary field.\nEvery week, our multidisciplinary team meets in a multidisciplinary conference to discuss each patient’s case in detail and to design a personalized treatment plan.

Patients with TCRBCL were significantly younger (median: 46 years) and had a significantly higher incidence of B symptoms (62%), hepatomegaly (33%) and marrow infiltration (33%) at presentation when compared to DLBCL (P<0.03). The CR rate after treatment was 48% for TCRBCL patients versus 79% for the DLBCL (P<0.003). Although the CR rates in between the two groups are significant, the difference in 3 years survival rates in each CR groups was insignificant (80% versus 77%).\nThe overall survival time in the two groups was 17 months. Event-free survival time in TCRBCL was 12 months, compared with 17 months in the DLBCL (P>0.05). The frequency of patients with TCRBCL achieving CR was 52.6% whereas that of patients with DLBCL was 79% (P<0.003). The TCRBCL 3 years event-free survival 48% and overall survival 64% were 63 and 72% for DLBCL, respectively.\nLeuk Lymphoma. 2002 Aug;43(8):1573-80.

Hodgkin’s disease is also called Hodgkin’s lymphoma.\nHodgkin’s disease is marked by the presence of abnormal large cells called Reed-Sternberg cells. Reed-Sternberg cells are derived from B cell lymphocytes (white blood cells). Reed-Sternberg cells are specific to Hodgkin’s disease. They are not found in non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.\nMost often HD starts in B cell lymphocytes located in lymph nodes in the neck area, although any lymph node may be the site of initial disease.\nTypes of Hodgkin's Disease\nThere are two major types of Hodgkin’s disease: Classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma and nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin’s disease.\nClassical Hodgkin's Lymphoma. Classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma accounts for about 95% of Hodgkin’s disease cases. It has four major subtypes:\n- Nodular Sclerosis. Nodular sclerosis is the most common subtype, representing about 60 - 80% of HD cases. Younger patients are more likely to have this type. The nodes first affected are often those located in the center of the chest (the mediastinum) or the neck.\n- Mixed Cellularity. Mixed cellularity is the next most common HD form, occurring in about 15 - 30% of patients, mostly in older adults. Mixed cellularity refers to the presence of Reed-Sternberg cells and other cell types.\n- Lymphocyte Rich. The lymphocyte-rich subtype accounts for about 5% of all HD cases. It tends to affect men more than women.\n- Lymphocyte Depleted. The lymphocyte-depleted subtype is the least common type of HD, occurring in only about 1% of cases. It is usually seen in older people and patients infected with HIV. It is also more common in less developed countries.

Here is an example of amplitude, or volume, being controlled by an LFO sine wave. This gives us that swelling or pulsing effect:\nThese are two of the most fundamental uses. However when used in combination with other synthesizer modulation tools such as envelopes or filters… well, here is where the full power of an LFO can really be unleashed. Here is an example of an LFO modulating a Low Pass filter, on a saw wave (which is richer in harmonic content than a sine wave). This gives us that classic sweeping, phasing effect we all love:\nAll of the above examples use a sine wav as the LFO. A sine wave has a very smooth up and down shape and thus produces a very smooth up and down sound. But we are not limited to only using a sine wave. Other wavefroms can be used, each with their own characteristic shapes, resulting in their own characteristic sounds. By looking at the shape of the waveform, one can get an idea of what the resultant sound would be.\nA triangle wave has a linear up and down sound. This results in a smooth up and down progression, even smoother than the Sine when used as an LFO.\nA sawtooth features a rise and then a sudden drop to silence.\nA square is merely on or off, kind of like a binary function applied to sound. This switches the sound on and switches the sound off.\nFinally, by matching the LFO frequency to the tempo of our song, we can get incredible timed patterns, that almost make our LFO act as a sort of sequencer. Most modern synths or synth software have a sync function that allows you to easily input the timing of the LFO rate. In other words, do you want the cycles to occur on quarter notes, eighth notes or through a whole measure?\nSo we have seen how LFO is used to alter the attributes of a given sound and how the waveform chosen for our LFO offers different sonic options.

This is very convenient because it means that everything we know about sines and cosines applies to a periodic function of any shape. Although the sum is infinite in theory, in many cases using just a few terms may be close enough to provide a good approximation.\nSuppose you wanted to make a square wave but only had sine waves to work with. The pictures below were made with the graphing calculator we used earlier. A series of seven sine waves are plotted on the left and the sum of those waves is plotted on the right, below.

In short, what Pythagoras observed has nothing much to do with notes, but with tones. Let’s go a bit further in the analysis now by introducing some more math. And, yes, I am very sorry: it’s the dreaded Fourier analysis indeed! 🙂\nYou know that we can decompose any periodic function into a sum of a (potentially infinite) series of simple sinusoidal functions, as illustrated below. I took the illustration from Wikipedia: the red function s6(x) is the sum of six sine functions of different amplitudes and (harmonically related) frequencies. The so-called Fourier transform S(f) (in blue) relates the six frequencies with the respective amplitudes.\nIn light of the discussion above, it is easy to see what this means for the sound coming from a plucked string. Using the angular frequency notation (so we write everything using ω instead of f), we know that the normal or natural modes of oscillation have frequencies ω = 2π/T = 2πf (so that’s the fundamental frequency or first harmonic), 2ω (second harmonic), 3ω (third harmonic), and so on and so on.\nNow, there’s no reason to assume that all of the sinusoidal functions that make up our tone should have the same phase: some phase shift Φ may be there and, hence, we should write our sinusoidal function not as cos(ωt), but as cos(ωt + Φ) in order to ensure our analysis is general enough.

The human auditory system detects the pitch of the fundamental largely by inferring it from the harmonics. You can test this by playing sine waves at, say, 400, 500, 600, 700 and 800 Hz simultaneously - you will hear it as a note of 100 Hz, even though the fundamental is not really there. Physically, the shape of the cochlea does something very like a Fourier transform on the incoming sound. If you \"unroll\" it, the cochlea is effectively a long tube of slowly varying width, and the width of each part of the tube determines its resonant frequency.\nThe upshot of this is that one reason for the auditory similarity between a note and its octave is due to the fact that they share so many harmonics. If you play a note at 100 Hz and then simultaneously start playing a note at 200 Hz, it makes some of the original note's harmonics louder but doesn't introduce any new ones.\nOf course, the same would be true with if the new note had a fundamental of 300 Hz rather than 200. However, in this case, while the high note still shares all its harmonics with the low one, but the low one only shares a third of its harmonics with the high one. Perhaps this is why we perceive the octave as a more consonant interval.\nThis can also help to explain the consonance of other intervals. For instance, the harmonics of a note at 150 Hz (a perfect fifth above 100 Hz) are 150, 300, 450, 600, 750, 900 Hz, etc. You can see that it has a lot of harmonics in common with a 100 Hz note, and this is part of the reason we find these two notes consonant and, in some ways, quite similar-sounding to one another.", "score": 0.835775793, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:ba4be358-c459-478a-8811-9a4c7dda081f>", "text": "Great tone and phrasing as always Muris\nGreat Muris like always!!!\nGood lesson Muris.

Phase distortion is a sonic special effect invented by casio that can give their synthesizers a unique sound. It works by distorting sine waves into other waveforms, mainly complex, but other waveforms are also available including saw, square, butter, sawtooth and more. To get a feel for what it does we have deliberately distorted a sine wave – the default setting is already very distorted! Please note this is a feature which exists solely on casio synthesizers and not on any other type of synthesizer – we don’t invent it! The vast range of waveforms available includes the straight sine waves, which resemble a triangle wave, the primary waveform which modulates the secondary. It is possible to combine all these waveforms and create various sounds. How does phase distortion work? All sine waves are distorted by phase – that is to say the phase of the wave changes as the wave is distorted. That means that the wave can be slowed down or sped up to give it a new harmonic spectrum and character. More complex waveforms can also be created, like sine-sawtooth. What are the waveforms available? The VS-1000R has twenty waveforms of different waveforms including the straight sine, primary wave, secondary wave, sawtooth, skislor, pan and more. It can give a very wide range of effects depending on how many waves are used and their output levels. How are they created?

It is the balance of harmonics that determines the tone. It is also called overtones. The music, accompanied by guitar and played with flute melody, creates an acoustic sound so rich in tone that it is hard to believe that there are only two instruments. Let’s take a look at why.\nWaveform of Flute and Guitar\nFirst, let’s compare the waveform of a flute sound to that of a guitar sound. For reference, let’s also compare it with the waveform of a sine wave.\nAll of the waveforms are for C5, which is a C note in the middle register.\nThe top one is a sine wave form. It has an exact simple wave shape.\nIn the middle is the waveform of the flute sound. The shape changes slightly due to the overlap of other harmonics waves, but I think it is close to a sine wave. I think it is probably the closest to a sine wave among musical instruments. (Ocarina and recorder are also close.)\nAt the bottom is the waveform of the guitar sound. It’s a complicated waveform. This is what happens when various harmonics waves are mixed together. The waveform is quite far from a sine wave. But when you listen to it, you can tell that it is the same pitch. The human ear is amazing.\nI mentioned at the beginning that tone is determined by the balance of harmonics. Let me explain this in terms of frequency spectrum.\nFirst, the spectrum of a sine wave, which is a wave of a single frequency, so in the above example, only C5 (523 Hz) has the intensity of the spectrum.\nThe frequency spectrum of a flute is similar to the spectrum of a sine wave, but it contains some harmonics. But basically, the spectrum of C5, the reference frequency, can be made stronger.\nIn contrast, the frequency spectrum of the guitar has an overall spread in the intensity of the various harmonics, and the spectrum seems to be rolling and spreading out horizontally.\nI believe that the combination of this vertically sharp flute and the horizontally gentle guitar creates an ensemble that is both expansive and sharp.\nThe horizontal axis is the frequency. Only the pitch of the harmonic overtone is written. In this example, for the reference note of C5, we have the following harmonics.", "score": 0.4137988920721667, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:282ab6c8-9631-44e1-832c-6e710eee3091>", "text": "In the initial decomposition a family of simple sine waves was determined (ranging from 1 complete sine wave over the 3 years to 109 sine waves). To smooth the image, only the first 18 waves were used to reconstruct the signal (i.e., the remaining 91 waves were ignored). This implies that any wave with a frequency higher than 6 cycles per year (i.e., a wave length of 2 months) has been removed.\nSo how does Fourier Analysis figure out the simple waves that form a complex wave? If you are familiar with a stringed instrument such as a guitar, you know that if a musical note is played that corresponds to the pitch of one of the strings, then that string will start to vibrate – it resonates. Thus if an E note is played, the E-string resonates. Now imagine having a harp with MANY strings. With a harp you could listen to a sound and see which strings were vibrating to know which notes made up the sound you hear. The different strings have different frequencies and the degree to which a string vibrates expresses the amplitude of that wave.\nWhat if our test wave is out of phase with the true wave in the signal? With a regularly oscillating wave it is possible to shift it (exactly a quarter cycle) so that it is perfectly uncorrelated with the original. If we were to encounter such a wave, our mathematical harp would have a problem, because it would conclude that the wave was not present. But it was! Thus Fourier Analysis uses two versions of each wave that are uncorrelated with each other – a sine wave and a cosine wave. If one doesn’t detect the true wave because of the phase, the other will. Thus the test waves are a family of wave pairs – sine waves and their corresponding cosine waves.\nTry it out!\nNew to Clark Labs software? Haven’t upgraded to IDRISI Selva yet?

The sine wave, a pure and straightforward form, contains only a single fundamental frequency that determines a sound's pitch.

If you don’t take spare guitar strings to a gig, you will break one within the first few songs... and if you generate an electronic impulse at 440Hz it will be an ‘A’ note. Get the idea? So it didn’t take much to imagine that to double the speed of that oscillator will produce an ‘A’ an octave above etc. Boffins found that different types of waveforms produced different timbres or tones. The main varieties are Sine, Saw, Square and Triangle, and these could be ‘filtered’ for loads more sonic possibilities. Synthesisers today work on exactly the same principles and have many more filters, meaning other ways of altering the generated sounds, than their predecessors.

In clinical trial simulation, we apply a study protocol to the model, thus recruiting “virtual” subjects, dosing them and making observations based on the model. The information we gather can help shape study design, accelerate the drug development process and increase regulatory efficiency.\nThe full paper can be accessed with the following hyperlink.", "score": 0.818948865, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:89540d7f-547b-4a68-aa86-9e5ef274574f>", "text": "While our main goal is to identify drug synergies that will improve the treatment of disease, this project will also enable us to generate several new functional interaction maps of cellular phenotypes (interactomes), including disease phenotypes such as breast carcinoma.\nAccessing drug synergy results\ngeWorkbench offers a simple interface for building custom queries based on the results of synergy experiments conducted at Columbia University.

This modular software and hardware architectural design platform permits the user to choose the programming language and development environment they are most familiar with. MICA is rugged, compact and maintenance-free, and so is suitable for use in the harshest industrial environments.\nFor the plastic moulding manufacturing environment, HARTING has developed the MICA EUROMAP 15 and MICA EUROMAP 63 Gateway variants, which convert the legacy EUROMAP 15/63 TCP/IP machine operating communications protocol into OPC UA, for example, via an intermediate JSON software format. This approach also offers the potential to provide IIoT web enablement and access to Cloud services for Big Data analysis or virtualisation, via an optional downloadable MQTT container. All operational software is housed in separate sandbox containers, ensuring that the MICA EUROMAP 15/63 Gateway provides a secure, fully configurable interface to the plant MES/ERP, eliminating expensive custom MES access software licencing charges that may have previously applied.\nAs an established HARTING customer, Ypsomed saw the immediate potential benefits of applying this Industry 4.0 Digital retrofit approach in its manufacturing operation at its headquarters in Burgdorf, Switzerland. Ypsomed produces several hundred million products a year and meets the highest medical technology quality standards. Due to the high proportion of individual plastic components in its products, the company possesses a large number of plastic injection moulding machines in its production plants.\nIn order to improve existing levels of plant productivity, Ypsomed has chosen to implement Industry 4.0 process improvements through digitisation at an early stage. To achieve this strategy, Ypsomed selected HARTING as a collaborative partner for its development project to connect legacy protocol machines to their MES/ERP system through a digital retrofit approach.\nIn 2017, one of the first tasks was to make data from a legacy injection moulding machine available for analysis.

There is a drive towards personalized medicine, aiming for treatment tailored to an individual because “one size does not fit all.” Computer modeling and simulation of the human body is one method being used to work towards this so-called personalized medicine.\nIn our lungs, air and blood are brought together to exchange the gases we need to survive. Air travels through your mouth or nose, down through your airways to the gas exchange region (the alveoli). In certain diseases, the process of air flow into our lungs is damaged. Current methods for diagnosing many lung diseases use a technique known as spirometry. This test measures airflow into and out of your mouth and provides a measure of how well your lung is working as a whole. However, significant damage may already be present before spirometry can detect changes.\nThrough the use of powerful computers and well-defined mathematics, it is possible to simulate how air flows into our lungs using a technique called computational fluid dynamics (CFD). People around the world are using this technique to simulate air flow, and the transport of inhaled drugs, through personalized computer models of a patient’s airways. In a recent review in WIREs Systems Biology and Medicine, the authors discuss research conducted around the world focusing on the simulation of airflow through the full pathway for oxygen (nose – airways – alveoli).\nIn particular, this Review presents work using image-based patient-specific models applied in the clinical setting. For example, the authors discuss the application of models of airflow in the nasal cavity to predict air flow changes after nasal surgery. They also describe CFD studies used in drug trials, providing evidence these computer methods can provide an improvement on current measures of lung function like spirometry.

Ultimately the R would go on to power the Supermarine racer to victory in 1929 and a world speed record later that year.\nA number of sources cite that the R was the stepping stone to the Merlin, it is likely that the Griffon was more the direct development of the R.

So there is a big risk of side-effects.\nUsing chemicals – that is, drugs – to modulate brain functioning is much more specific. You can tailor drugs much more easily to act on only certain neuronal circuits, and not the ones right next to them. But drugs are much, much slower than electrodes to take effect.\nOptogenetics offers the best of both worlds. It can be as specific as drugs, and as fast-acting as electrical stimulation.\nYou’re not yet wiring fiberoptic cables into the brains of humans. What are the implications of optogenetics for human health?\nThe highest potential of optogenetics is in helping us to understand more about how the brain functions. Studying brain functioning in animal models, such as rodents, increases our understanding of how human brains work – and, with it, our ability to design better treatments for brain-related conditions.\nIn the near term, the benefits will come from improving the process of testing and developing drugs. In the longer term, optogenetics could make electrical stimulation of the brain more precise and effective by helping us to know where to better position the electrodes that are already being used in humans to ameliorate symptoms of, for example, Parkinson’s.\nOr it could ultimately offer an alternative to electrical stimulation in the human brain, combining the best-of-both-world features of speed and specificity. However using optogenetics for fundamental brain research – whose results could lead to non-optogenetic therapies – is in my opinion the most likely contribution of this technology for better mental health.\nWhat are examples of conditions for which optogenetics could potentially improve treatments?\nMood or motor disorders – for example, Parkinson’s disease, tremor, depression, anxiety, addiction, obsessive-compulsive disorder, epilepsy, Alzheimer’s disease, or control of chronic pain.\nTo start with the near term issue, how could optogenetics improve the process of developing drugs for these conditions?\nOne of the big problems in behavioural neuroscience is that when you do an experiment involving animal models, obviously you need an experimental cohort and a control, and there will inevitably be some variability between the two groups.

Ask your doctor for more information.\nExplanationNew treatments for lung cancer are constantly being developed and tested in clinical trials. All new treatments need to go through clinical trials to test if they’re safe, have side-effects, are better than the current treatments available, or help you to feel better. Clinical trials may test changes to treatments already being used or may involve completely new treatments.\nSome trials compare a standard treatment against a new one. Neither you nor your doctor will be able to choose which treatment you receive during this type of trial. You’ll be given information about both treatments and, if you agree to take part in the trial, you’ll be randomly allocated to your treatment. This means it will be pure chance which type of treatment you get.\nAnother type of clinical trial is a placebo-controlled trial where a new treatment is compared with a dummy pill (placebo). Again, you can’t choose which you receive. These trials are usually done if there isn’t a good standard treatment available for you. They are usually tried after you have already had some other standard treatments.\nThe researchers will be looking to see if either group of patients in the trial does better or has fewer side-effects. This helps them to see whether the new treatment is better or worse than the alternative.\nThe main advantage of entering a trial is that you will be helping others with the same condition by helping to identify the best treatments.

When cadmium-core quantum dots were injected into mice with hydrogel implants, the cells within the hydrogel glowed green. However, when dots with a more biocompatible zinc-based coating were injected, the hydrogel did not glow, suggesting that the zinc coating effectively shielded the cells in the hydrogel from cadmium toxicity.\nTo test the hydrogel’s ability to deliver a treatment, the researchers created slabs embedded with cells that glow in the presence of calcium. The slabs were then fitted with a blue light fiber optic and implanted in mice with chemically induced diabetes.

To further validate this finding, the mice were given a glucose tolerance test to see how long it took for their blood sugar levels to return to normal—since diabetes impairs the body’s ability to process sugar, blood sugar levels remain abnormally high for longer periods of time than in a person or animal without diabetes. The light-exposed diabetic mice achieved regular blood sugar levels within an hour and a half, while the untreated diabetic mice continued to have elevated blood sugar even after two hours, indicating that light delivered via the hydrogel produced a measurable biological effect and may someday be a useful means of delivering optogenetic treatments.\nBy delivering light inside the body in a controlled and predictable manner and being able to host genetically engineered cells that respond to light or emit light in response to specific chemical signals, the hydrogels created by Yun and colleagues may help address some of the challenges with using optogenetic approaches in clinical care.", "score": 0.87856, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:9d93fa2a-ab5c-499e-8ac4-2d74e909f855>", "text": "Our previous study using the STZ/insulin-administered and the non–STZ-administered animals in the mouse model (15) and in the rat model (7,38) did not detect any difference in embryonic development.

On day 5.5 of pregnancy (E5.5), insulin pellets were removed to permit frank hyperglycemia (>250 mg/dL glucose level) so the developing embryos would be exposed to a hyperglycemic environment during the critical period of closure of the neural tube (neurulation) (E8–E10.5). Therefore, our mouse model of diabetic embryopathy specifically impacts neurulation and induces NTDs. On the basis of our extensive studies (15,20), insulin treatment from E0.5 to E5.5 is essential for successful implantation establishment and, thus, prevents early embryonic lethality (resorption) caused by hyperglycemic exposure at early embryonic stages (≤E5.5).

The researchers used nanoscale pH sensors and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to track liver cells previously transplanted into mice. This new method is likely to be an important tool for improving cell replacement therapies for conditions such as liver failure and type 1 diabetes.\n“This technology has the potential to turn the human body into less of a black box and tell us if transplanted cells are still alive”, said Mike McMahon, Ph.D., an associate professor of radiology at the Johns Hopkins.\nAdvances in the field of regenerative medicine depend heavily on the reliability of methods of replacing damaged or missing cells, such as injecting pancreatic cells in people with diabetes. Type 1 diabetes causes a loss of pancreatic beta-cells and insulin dependency since cells don’t make enough insulin. In order to protect the transplanted pancreatic cells from the immune system, they can be placed in hydrogel membrane before transplantation. Nevertheless, these cells eventually stop working in most patients. Then it is assumed that the cells have died, but time and reason of their deaths remain unclear.\nThe researchers devised an extremely tiny nanosenor composed of amino acid L-arginine and fat, as well as separate indicator molecules that produce signals detectable by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) as well as light signals when the cells are alive. L-arginine is sensitive to small changes in pH value, which can be caused by the death of nearby cells. Changes in the acidity value would initiate changes in sensor molecules, producing a signal that could be detected by MRI.\nIn order to test the efficiency of nanosensors in vivo, the research team placed them into hydrogel spheres along with liver cells and sensory molecules that produce bioluminescent light when the cells are alive. They injected these spheres under the skin of mice. MRI precisely detected the position of these cells in the body, and the researchers were able to observe the number of cells which were still alive. These light indicators cannot be used to check cells in humans because the size of our bodies prevents the visible signals from getting through.\nThe components of these spheres such as hydrogel membrane, fat molecules and L-arginine are safe for humans.", "score": 0.847234607, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:dfa7d6b3-8b29-4fd9-82cd-5587b57eca0a>", "text": "Scientists have successfully altered the neural networks of laboratory mice using a wireless controller; allowing them to study the effects of neural stimulation without invasive procedures and without test subjects tethered by wires.\nThe tiny implant, smaller than the width of a human hair, let the scientists determine the path a mouse walks using a remote control to inject drugs and shine lights on neurons inside the brain.\nNeuroscientists have until now been limited to injecting drugs through larger tubes and delivering photostimulation through fibre-optic cables, both of which require surgery that can damage the brain and restrict an animal's natural movements.\nThe optofluidic implant developed by the team from Washington University School of Medicine and the University of Illinois was found to damage and displace much less brain tissue than the metal tubes, or cannulas, scientists typically use to inject drugs.\nThe device is mounted to the head of the mouse and is powered by a small battery, removing the need for it to be wired, and contains tiny reservoirs filled with the drugs to be administered during tests.\nIn one such experiment, mice were made to walk in circles after a drug that mimics morphine was injected into the region of the mouse's brain that controls motivation and addiction.\nIn other tests the scientists used a technique known as optogenetics, where mice have been modified so that their neurons are lights sensitive, to stimulate the mice's brain cells with miniature LEDs.

Later, the same group of neurons was activated naturally, in a completely different context (a new box). The mice acted as if they remembered getting shocked in this new context, even though the actual foot shocks were administered somewhere else. The point of this study was not to make a murine version of Inception, but rather to understand how memory is evoked by environment, a crucial issue in both addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder.\nIn the most dramatic demonstration of the potential of optogenetics, a team of scientists at the University of Illinois, together with my Washington University colleagues, created genuine mouse cyborgs. They built a micron-scale electronic device that could seamlessly interact with optogenetically modified neurons in a mouse’s brain.\nTo create a cyborg mouse, the researchers used engineered viruses to deliver light-activated proteins to the mouse's neurological reward circuitry, and then injected a miniaturized electronic control device into the mouse’s brain.

It can cause ulcerations in the cornea and skin, where it often leads to neuropathic pain and foot ulcerations that often require amputation.\nUnderstanding of the development of DPN is mostly obscure, partly due to the lack of good animal models available.

According to Fu-shin Yu, Ph.D., professor of ophthalmology and director of research at the Kresge Eye Institute of Wayne State University, the cornea is the most densely innervated mammalian tissue and is an excellent model to study the underlying mechanisms for DPN.\nThe release quotes Yu as saying, “Using Streptozotocin-induced type I diabetes and cornea epithelial wounding experimental models, we made novel observations that may soon lead to innovative therapies to treat DPN and ulcerations of the cornea and skin in diabetic patients.”\nYu and his research team discovered that in the diabetic mouse cornea, the density of sensory nerve fibers and their endings are drastically reduced, similar to patients with DPN. Moreover, the regenerative capacity of corneal nerves following wounding is impaired in the corneas of diabetic patients compared to normal B6 mouse corneas. This phenomenon coincided with a reduction in the number of infiltrating dendritic cells in the wounded corneas of diabetic mice, leading to the conclusion that sensory neuropathy is related to this decline in the dendritic cell population in the diabetic cornea.

Topiramate, a mitochondrial carbonic anhydrase inhibitor, is efficacious at both preventing and treating BBB disruption in this diet-induced obese type II diabetic mouse model.\nType II diabetes mellitus, as well as obesity and consumption of Western diets, are known vascular risk factors for cognitive impairment and increased risk of dementia [1, 2]. Emerging clinical evidence and studies in animal models of metabolic syndrome suggest that alterations in the integrity of the cerebrovascular blood–brain barrier (BBB) are associated with cognitive decline . This phenomenon also occurs with visual impairment as observed with disturbances in blood–retinal barrier (BRB) integrity in diabetic retinopathy. The BBB and BRB provide a structural and functional barrier, which impedes and regulates the influx of compounds from the blood into the brain or retina, respectively. There is growing evidence suggesting that the disruption of the BRB and BBB is an early hallmark of the subsequent retinal edema and central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction [4, 5]. However, the mechanisms by which diet or metabolic syndrome induces dysfunction of the BBB and BRB are not completely understood.\nHigh-fat (HF) diet consumption causes BBB disruption in a variety of animal models of obesity regardless of the diet compositions; examples include high energy diets and diets rich in saturated fatty acids [3, 6,7,8]. Type II diabetes, designated by hyperglycemia and insulin resistance, is associated with cognitive dysfunction characterized by microvascular and neurovascular unit changes. Changes in the brain microvasculature are characterized by altered permeability, cerebral extravasation of plasma molecules, neuroinflammatory and oxidative milieu, and progressive loss of neuronal function.

A study by Vanndamme and Bobeck used PAMAM dendrimers as ophthalmic delivery vehicles in rabbits for two model drugs and measured the ocular residence time of this delivery to be comparable and in some cases greater than current bioadhesive polymers used in ocular delivery.

In the case of drug delivery to the brain, dendrimers are able to take advantage of the EPR effect and blood-brain barrier (BBB) impairment to cross the BBB effectively in vivo.

A fiber was inserted to light up and stimulate the pre-frontal cortex, and the mice fully recovered from depression symptoms—they began to interact with other mice. The optogenetic manipulation of cortical neuron firing highlighted the key activity of the prefrontal cortex in depression-like behavior and showed the possibility of counteracting depression symptoms. Evidence suggested that electrical stimulation can relieve depression that is resistant to other treatments .\nAnxiety, the most common among psychiatric disorders, has been linked to the amygdala—a region in the brain associated with emotional processing. The neural mechanisms behind the condition, however, were unknown until precise optogenetic stimulation of mouse basolateral amygdala terminals showed a reversal of anxiety symptoms. Conversely, when the cells in this region were optogenetically inhibited through glutamate receptor antagonism, anxious behavior increased .

The consumption of omega-3 fatty acids creates protective molecules such as resolvin.\nPreviously, the researchers had observed that a diet containing omega-3 fatty acids from fish improved the symptoms of diabetic neuropathy in mice diagnosed with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes. This new study examined why that was the case.\nIn the new study, researchers wanted to find out the effects of fish oil on mice with diabetes. The researchers put the diabetic mice on a high-fat diet and injected them with resolvin each day or gave the mice a high-fat diet where half of the fat was derived from fish oil.\nThe diabetic mice that were not treated with fish oil exhibited a reduced sense of touch in their paws due to having fewer nerves in the skin on their paws and decreased signal transmission along the nerves. The eyes of these same mice also exhibited fewer nerves.\nEven though the fish oil did not reduce the blood glucose levels to an acceptable range, it did improve the health of their nerves in terms of both sensory signal transmission and density. The researchers also noted that resolving encouraged nerve regeneration.\nThey concluded that more research on the benefits of fish oil for neuropathy and nerve regeneration needs to be performed such as clinical trials with people. Their study on mice suggested that fish oil can reverse some of the damaging effects of diabetes on the nerves after a long duration of poorly- controlled blood glucose levels.\nThe researchers stated that they aspire to begin studies with people who have diabetes and suffer from peripheral neuropathy due to it.\nThe researchers wanted to find out if fish oil could be used as a potential treatment to treat diabetic peripheral neuropathy.

Hearing function was evaluated 1, 3, and 5 months after induction of diabetes (five diabetic and five control animals per time point) using auditory-evoked brain stem responses (ABRs). Mice (four diabetic and four control) were exposed to loud noise (105 dB) 5 months after induction of diabetes. ABRs were measured before and after noise exposure. Cochlear blood flows were measured by laser-Doppler flowmeter. Spiral ganglion cells (SGCs) were counted. Vessel endothelial cells were observed by CD31 immunostaining. Chronologic changes in the ABR threshold shift were not significantly different between the diabetic and control groups. However, vessel walls in the modiolus of the cochleae were significantly thicker in the diabetic group than the control group. Additionally, recovery from noise-induced injury was significantly impaired in diabetic mice. Reduced cochlea blood flows and SGC loss were observed in diabetic mice cochleae after noise exposure. Our data suggest that diabetic cochleae are more susceptible than controls to loud noise exposure, and decreased cochlear blood flow due to sclerosis of the vessels and consequent loss of SGCs are possible mechanisms of hearing impairment in diabetic patients.\n- Received December 30, 2011.\n- Accepted May 14, 2012.\n- © 2012 by the American Diabetes Association.\nReaders may use this article as long as the work is properly cited, the use is educational and not for profit, and the work is not altered.

The mice exposed to lavender also didn’t show any signs of motor impairment, which is an effect documented in studies of mice on benzodiazepines, a drug that’s commonly used to treat anxiety. The linalool didn’t work when the mice’s ability to smell was blocked, implying that the effects were, in fact, caused by scent itself, and that in order to work, linalool triggered odor-sensitive neurons in the nose that send signals to certain areas of the brain.\nSo what does all this mean? Well, the study found that the olfactory system was key for inducing anxiety-reducing effects. The findings help lay a foundation for further exploration of the potential clinical uses of linalool odor (or other lavender-based products) in anxiety treatments, and the medical field in general.

However, researchers at Karolinska Institutet have managed to prevent diabetic kidney function deteriorating in mice using a new treatment method, and are confident that it could be a possible treatment for humans as well. The study is published in the journal Cell Metabolism.\nDiabetic kidney disease (or diabetic kidney failure) is the most common reason for dialysis. The clearest indication is the leakage of different plasma proteins into the urine, but there is also insufficient cleansing of waste products from the blood, impaired filtration and reduced urine production. There are currently few treatments available that can prevent the progressive deterioration of kidney function in patients, who often have no choice but to undergo dialysis or kidney transplantation.\nIt has long been known that people with diabetic kidney disease have an accumulation of lipid droplets in the kidneys, but scientists have not known what causes this phenomenon or the extent to which it exacerbates the disease. The researchers at Karolinska Institutet previously demonstrated that a special growth factor called VEGF-B (vascular endothelial growth factor B) controls the uptake of fats into muscles by regulating the ability of the cells coating the inner blood vessel walls to transport fat.oped\nNewly developed drug candidate\nBy studying mice with diabetic kidney disease, the team has now uncovered a correlation between VEGF-B in the kidneys and the degree of pathological severity. When they blocked the biological effect of VEGF-B in mice with diabetic kidney disease using a newly developed drug candidate, they found a decrease in accumulated lipids in the kidneys. They subsequently managed to make special cells in the renal filtration apparatus called podocytes respond again to insulin signalling and thus prevent further deterioration in kidney function.\n“We’ve also been able to see from kidney biopsies that people with diabetic kidney disease also have raised levels of VEGF-B,” says Professor Ulf Eriksson at the Department of Medical Biochemistry and Biophysics. “This suggests that our treatment, in which we ‘freeze’ the effect of the disease, could work on people so that they are spared dialysis. But the drug candidate that we’ve used has to be shown to be safe and free from unacceptable adverse effects.”\nHope to extend treatment\nThe researchers now hope to extend their treatment concept to other kidney diseases that also cause the leakage of plasma proteins into the urine.", "score": 1.034287482444746e-19, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:174e2619-03d6-42e1-bbfb-bd207a6655f3>", "text": "Cardiovascular disease is one of the major causes of mortality in diabetic patients. Mounting studies have shown that garlic exhibits, possibly through its antioxidant potential, diverse biological activities. In this study, we investigated the alleviating effects of garlic oil (GO) and its two major components, diallyl disulfide (DADS) and diallyl trisulfide (DATS), on diabetic cardiomyopathy in rats. Physiological cardiac parameters were obtained using echocardiography. Apoptotic cells were evaluated using TUNEL and DAPI staining. Protein expression levels were determined using Western blotting analysis. Our findings indicated that in diabetic rat hearts significantly decreased fractional shortening percentage, increased levels of nitrotyrosine, an elevated number of TUNEL-positive cells, enhanced levels of caspase 3 expression, and decreased PI3K-Akt signaling pathway activities were observed. Furthermore, all of these alterations were reversed following both GO and DATS (or DADS) administrations through increasing PI3K-Akt signaling pathway activities and inhibiting both the death receptor-dependent and the mitochondria-dependent apoptotic pathways. In conclusion, this study shows that DATS and DADS, with the efficacy order DATS > DADS, have the therapeutic potential for ameliorating diabetic cardiomyopathy. Furthermore, the therapeutic effects of GO on diabetic cardiomyopathy should be mainly from DATS and DADS.\n- diabetic cardiomyopathy\nthe ubiquitous prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) has been noticeably increasing globally, and the number of affected patients was estimated to be 171 million (or 2.8% of the worldwide population) in 2000, and will be projected to rise to 366 million (or 4.4%) in 2030 (35). Besides, 12% of the global healthcare expenses were expected to be spent on diabetes in 2010 (40). Also, diabetes is a well-known serious factor for the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Indeed, diabetic patients have a two- to eightfold higher chance of developing CVD in comparison with normal subjects (15). Furthermore, CVD is the major cause of mortality and morbidity in patients with diabetes. CVD can explain up to 80% of premature excess mortality in diabetic patients (36).", "score": 4.257179534395307e-20, "source": "sparse"}]}

According to USA Today, 93 percent of all expectant mothers who read a pregnancy guide read What to Expect When You’re Expecting.\nSo it’s certainly worthwhile to look at this book to get an idea of what American women are learning about pregnancy.\nIt’s an impressive tome (616 pages) that does a good job of explaining everything an expectant mother might want to know as well as some things she mightn’t (critics have called it too alarmist because it covers scary complications). It covers fetal development, diet and lifestyle recommendations for a healthy pregnancy, common symptoms, labor and delivery, the postpartum period, and much more. It is well-organized and easy to read. It has question and answer sections to cover pretty much every question a pregnant woman has ever asked, even rather silly ones (“All my pregnant friends seem to have problems with constipation.

Actually, some pretty random parts of your body feel the affects of those hormonal surges, including your nose.\nSwelling of mucus membranes means your nasal passages get clogged and can stay clogged.

The device, known as \"Houfeng Didong Yi,\" featured a bronze urn-shaped structure with dragons and toads, indicating earthquake direction. Modern seismographs, extremely sensitive, detect even the smallest tremors, improving earthquake understanding and early warning systems. The SOS-LIFE earthquake early warning system uses digital equipment, alarms, rechargeable batteries, and a string for portability, monitoring for P waves to alert users 30-60 seconds before an earthquake. Zhang Heng's invention was initially met with skepticism but later validated by an earthquake report from the direction indicated by the device. In 2005, a replica was created by a group from the Chinese Academy of Sciences, demonstrating the seismoscope's sensitivity and direction-awareness. The working principle of Zhang's model, using inertia with a static base and hanging pendulum, is still used in modern seismographs.

And with all the data these clusters produce, we are constantly improving our understanding of these geological events, developing early warning systems and figuring out how to build the safest structures. We have technology on our side, of course, and yet the design of the earliest earthquake detection device isn't that different from today's versions. Only it was created nearly 2000 years ago, before people even understood what an earthquake was.\nZhang Heng lived in China during the Han dynasty, and history remembers him as a scholar in many fields. He dabbled in astronomy, mathematics, science, engineering, cartography and poetry, among other fields of study and artistic pursuits. He served as a government official for much of his adult life, and was invited to the imperial court in his mid-30s by Emperor An in honor of his skills as a mathematician.\nHe worked on calculating pi, mapped stars, and in tandem with his academic career, was an inventor. He improved the accuracy of inflow clepsydra -- a type of water clock that measures time by the flow of liquid -- and is credited with creating the first water-powered armillary sphere (a dynamic model that illustrates the movement of celestial objects). But Zhang Heng is most famed for inventing the world's first seismoscope.\nA Chinese stamp commemorating Zhang Heng (via Getty/iStockphoto)\nHe introduced his device to the imperial court in the capital of Luoyang in AD 132, seven years before his death AD 139. While there are no surviving physical remnants or illustrations of his seismoscope, historical descriptions depict it as being a large bronze instrument, similar in shape to an urn or a vase.

By analyzing field seismic data from electromagnetic and hydraulic seismic vibrators in mining area, we find when media underground is complex or the base-plate of vibrator is coupled poorly with ground, there is a 9.30 m positioning precision error and false multiple waves in the electromagnetic vibrator data reference to hydraulic vibrator data. The paper analyzes the theoretical reason of above problems by studying how the signal of electromagnetic vibrator is excited, then proposes a new method of correlation detection based on the reconstructed excitation signal (CDBRES). CDBRES includes following steps. First, it extracts the direct wave signal from seismometer near base-plate of electromagnetic vibrator. Next, it reconstructs the excitation signal according to the extracted direct wave. Then, it detects the seismic data using cross-correlation with the reconstructed excitation signal as a reference. Finally, it uses spectrum whitening to improve detection quality. We simulate with ray-tracing method, and simulation results show that the reconstructed excitation signal is extremely consistence with the ideal excitation signal, the correlation coefficient between them is up to 0.9869. And the signal of electromagnetic vibrator is detected correctly with CDBRES method. Then a field comparison experiment between hydraulic vibrator MiniVib T15000 and electromagnetic vibrator PHVS 500 was carried out near a copper and nickel deposit area. Their output force are 30000N and 300N, respectively. Though there is a great output force difference, the detection result of PHVS 500 using CDBRES method is still consistent with MiniVib T15000. Reference to the MiniVib T15000, the positioning error of PHVS 500 is only 0.93m in relatively stronger noise level. In addition, false multiple waves are invisible. In summary, CDBRES method can be used for high precision detection of electromagnetic vibrator in mining area and complex media prospecting.

The shockwaves of an earthquake would cause the pendulum to swing, activating one of the mechanisms inside. The corresponding dragon would gift its ball to the toad, informing the court that not only had an earthquake occurred, but from which general direction the tremors came. You see, each dragon and toad related to a compass point -- north, northwest, west, and so on -- so the government would know where to send aid.\nAn attempt at a working replica (Science & Society Picture Library via Getty)\nZhang Heng's invention was initially met with skepticism. His views on certain topics made him unpopular with some of his peers, and worse yet, his seismoscope was unproven. But as the story goes, several years later, a ball finally dropped. This in and of itself wasn't evidence it worked, of course -- no earthquake had been felt in the capital -- but days later a messenger arrived to report of a serious earthquake that originated hundreds of miles away, off to the west of Luoyang in the direction the now empty dragon mouth faced.\nZhang Heng called his seismoscope Houfeng Didong Yi, meaning an \"instrument for measuring the seasonal winds and the movements of the Earth.\" While many people of his time believed earthquakes had spiritual catalysts, he and a collection of other scholars were of the opinion the events were caused by winds and changes in air pressure -- bearing in mind this was way, way before the seed of plate tectonic theory sprouted in the early 20th century.\nIn the centuries after Zhang Heng's death, other Chinese intellectuals were said have created successor seismoscopes of his design. Since nothing tangible survived the passage of time, however, historians of our era have struggled to reconcile these centuries-old accounts with a working replica of Zhang's device. Some even speculated it never existed. While the ornate nature of the seismoscope was well described, the exact mechanisms driving it weren't. Attempts to reinvent it in the 19th and 20th centuries proved unsuccessful. It remained unclear, for example, how an ancient pendulum design could be sensitive enough to detect earthquakes hundreds of miles away. Furthermore, how could the movement trigger just one mechanism and spare the others?", "score": 0.03163026298243738, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:f2401e6e-992a-4b73-8de3-067d19b169aa>", "text": "A research team led by Yong-Hang Zhang from the Arizona State University is involved in the development of novel ways using nanoscale materials for optimizing infrared photodetector technology used in national security and defense systems.\nASU engineers are working on technological advances that promise to help enhance infrared photodetection used in sophisticated weapons and surveillance system, industrial and home security systems, medical diagnostics and night vision equipment for law enforcement and driving safety. (Photo by: Orkun Cellek/ASU)\nThe research team used several ultrathin nanomaterial layers wherein crystals are produced in every layer. The combination of these layered structures forms ‘superlattices.’ Zhang explained that the sensitivity and detection quality of a photodectector depend on the conversion efficiency attained by these crystals.\nThe detection wavelengths of the superlattices developed by the research team can be widely modified by altering the composition and design of the layered structures. Zhang informed that the infrared photodetector’s sensitivity can be improved by accurately arranging the nanoscale materials into superlattice structures.\nThe research team utilized a combination of indium arsenide antimonide and indium arsenide to form the superlattice structures. This combination enables devices to produce photo electrons required to offer infrared signal imaging and detection, explained Elizabeth Steenbergen, one of the researchers.\nZhang informed that this combination also decreases the loss of optically agitated electrons, thus improving the carrier lifetime of the electrons by over 10 folds than that can be attained by other conventional material combinations utilized in the technology. Carrier lifetime is an important aspect that has restricted the efficiency of a photodetector in the past. Infrared detectors made of this combination require less cooling, which in turn decreases the power required to operate the devices. Thus, these devices are more cost effective and reliable and pave the way to improve a number of systems such as advanced surveillance systems, guided weaponry, home and industrial security systems, and utilize the infrared detection for road-safety devices and medical imaging.\nAccording to the research team, the device design can be optimized by improving the layering designs of the complex superlattice structures.", "score": 3.152540483857488e-06, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:bdfed838-dafd-46f5-b133-b0f2c4e8917f>", "text": "In 2005, a group of seismologists and archaeologists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences announced they had created a proven, functioning replica. In their version, the pendulum itself doesn't interact with any levers; instead, it's suspended above another ball perched atop a thin pedestal. When the pendulum swings, it nudges that central ball down one of eight channels, where it hits a trigger system that animates the external dragon mouth. We don't know this is exactly how Zhang's model worked, of course, but it shows that only a minor reinterpretation of how the seismoscope is described in historical texts can lead to the creation of a sensitive, direction-aware device.\nEven though Zhang's device is nearly two millennia old, the working principle behind it is still commonly used today. A popular form of modern seismograph uses exactly the same properties of inertia, whereby a static base and hanging pendulum move independently of each other when the ground shakes. Only nowadays the pendulum is a magnet, and the induced current its swinging produces in the conductive base is the record. Converting the fluctuations into a digital signal allows such seismographs to document tremor intensity, their timespan, etc. Zhang's invention noted the simple occurrence of an earthquake, hence the name seismoscope.\nWhile Zhang's original design has more or less survived the test of time, we're still coming up with new monitoring techniques. Researchers at Stanford announced last year, for instance, that they had developed a method of detecting earthquakes using existing fiber optic cables. Predicting earthquakes before they happen, though, is something we're far from mastering. The best we can really do at the moment is use seismographs to warn of impending shockwaves just after an earthquake has struck. Typically, though, this heads-up is just a matter of seconds.\nOur awareness of shifting tectonic plates gives us the ability to vaguely surmise where earthquakes could happen in the future. Attempts at more precise techniques have shown promise, only to be relabelled unreliable later. There is some anecdotal evidence, however, that animals can exhibit strange behavior up to several days before an earthquake.\nThe common toad Bufo bufo (via Getty)\nThe most reliable study of this phenomenon was published in 2010.", "score": 2.512417986342816e-06, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:8f61bcec-d78a-48d6-9ea4-fad55c2b95b8>", "text": "CNBP PhD Student Ms Yuan Qi Yeoh enjoyed a two week collaborative visit with Prof Xuefeng Guo’s team at Peking University.

The Texas red/BHQ2-based sensor showed the best affinity constant (Kd) of 21.87 ng mL−1. It was found that the strand-displacement aptasensing strategy was impacted by the complementary position and length of the complementary strands. Additionally, the hybridization chain reaction (HCR) amplification strategy was introduced, yielding a 12-fold improved sensitivity of 0.45 ng mL−1.

The agarose gel and the twisted macro-bend coupling structure are first combined for RH sensing applications. The refractive index (RI) of the agarose gel increases with the increase of the RH and is in linear proportion from 20 to 80%RH. The side coupling power, which changes directly with the RI of the agarose gel, can strip the source noise from the sensor signal and improve the signal to noise ratio substantially. The experiment results show that the sensitivity of the proposed sensor increases while the bend radius decreases. When the bend radius is 8 mm, the sensor has a linear response from 40% to 80% RH with the sensitivity of 4.23 nW/% and the limit of detection of 0.70%. A higher sensitivity of 12.49 nW/% is achieved when RH raises from 80% to 90% and the limit of detection decreases to 0.55%. Furthermore, the proposed sensor is a low-cost solution, offering advantages of good reversibility, fast response time, and compensable temperature dependence.

Sometimes the plants are grown in moist inert medium such as perlite or coconut husks. Unlike soil, the medium is not providing any nutrients. In a soil-based system, nutrients from the soil dissolve in water and the roots of the plants absorb them. In a hydroponic system, nutrients are dissolved into the plant’s water supply and the soil is thus no longer a requirement for the plant to grow. Almost any plant can be grown this way. But the question remains as to whether that plant should be considered organic.\nIn 2010, the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB), the advisory board to the National Organic Program (NOP), considered this question. The board made the following strong statement in their recommendation, “Hydroponics, the production of plants in nutrient rich solutions or moist inert material, or aeroponics, a variation in which plant roots are suspended in air and continually misted with nutrient solution, have their place in production agriculture, but certainly cannot be classified as certified organic growing methods due to their exclusion of the soil-plant ecology intrinsic to organic farming systems and USDA/NOP regulations governing them.” So why do we continue to see hydroponically grown certified organic tomatoes available for sale?\nThe current administration of the National Organic Program continues to allow the certification of hydroponic operations despite the recommendation from the NOSB that clearly states it is not compatible with organic production. This has angered many consumers and organic farmers in Vermont and across the nation.

Here, plants are provided with nutrients without the harmful effects of chemicals, in a greenhouse set up.\nTo answer your question on greenhouses, they may not necessarily mean that hydroponics is used. Greenhouses can be employed for farming without employing hydroponics as well.\nHow did you come into this hydroponics space? What activities are you involved in currently?\nI am 47 years old now. 3 years ago I took the decision to transform to the agricultural sector. I hold a PHD in Zoology and worked as a pathologist for 20 years. I I gained experience in aquaculture at Maharashtra for 3 years. This sector got me very interested and that’s how I arrived at running a consultancy to provide hydroponics’ support.\nThese methods employ cultivation of crops without fertilizers. We feed the plants with water from aquaponics through hydroponics. The more I understood, the more I wanted to dive deeper into hydroponics. I got in touch with scientists from the US, Canada and many others places and got answers to all my questions.\nFinally, I decided to open my centre in India.\nAre you working on projects independently or are you tied to a company?\nYes, I got my consultancy registered in May 2017.\nThis year, I completed a project for a company in Dubai. We built 1000, 6×4 sq. foot greenhouses, in Pune and sent them to Dubai. This was in association with a company called Growell Hydroponics.\nGrowell Hydroponics, contacted me after checking our website – we got into an agreement to support their hydroponics and aquaponics initiative. As of now, we have signed 2-3 contracts and the first is already successfully completed.\nSo, what are these small greenhouses for? Is it for people to keep in their gardens?\nYes, people in Dubai hardly have any land. But, there is a growing demand for growing their own vegetables and fruits.", "score": 0.861829221, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:2dfb4249-4621-474a-9bf6-6a9df50f71d8>", "text": "Do you use any organic, permaculture, hydroponic, biodynamic or other methods?

Nature has been kind enough to provide us with all we need to control weeds, harmful insects and feed the soil… I have adapted much of my gardening practice to adhere to the principles of permaculture and it seems to be working very well. I look on my wicking garden beds as a hybrid planter since the moisture comes from the bottom up.\nDo you use compost? Where do you get it and how does it help your plants?\nI find compost to be an indispensable part of gardening. After all, what does one do with the refuge left behind from all that is growing? I have three types of composting. First, I have a rotating compost barrel which takes care of the growing matter. Second, I use a Bokashi compost system on everything except my wicking garden and grow buckets and that takes care of most of my kitchen scraps. The last component of my composting system is my worm bin. I believe compost returns nutrients to the soil and keeps it healthy. It is the soil that feeds our plants and gives us bountiful nutrient rich fruit and vegetables.\nDo you have any advice for someone that’s just getting started?\nMost people are fairly busy in their day to day lives, if you start with just a planter or two and grow something you like to eat, it’s a start. You may find you like the fruits of your labor and want to expand when time and money allow. Don’t expect your garden to be perfect. Successes and failures happen, even to experienced gardeners. Embrace the failures and learn; celebrate the success and rejoice. Gardening should be enjoyable and relaxing not something to stress over.

This can be all achieved by avoiding the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides as well as using products that nurture your garden soil and the organisms living in it.\nSo, when you embrace the organic gardening philosophy, it is easy to see how beneficial organic fertilizers are for your landscape. They feed the soil, create a sustainable environment and a healthy soil – which certainly leads to healthy plants. However, organic gardening is much more than nourishing your plants.\nJust like in nature, an organic soil is alive with microbes and fungi releases that nutrients slowly to plants (as described above). This type of enrichment with organic supplements ensures the growth of naturally occurring organisms. In other words, organic fertilizers give your plants the tools they need in order to access the nutrients in the soil and have the strength to protect themselves from harmful pathogens and pests.\nIf there is one weakness of organic fertilizers, it has to be the slow release into the soil, which makes them not immediately available to plants. However, this could also be solved with the use of liquid fertilizers or foliar applications.\nThe Right Kind Of ‘Food For Plants’\nNowadays, high-quality organic fertilizers are products of natural decomposition. They are easy for the plants to digest, made from natural sources and providing garden plants with a slow release, consistent nourishment.\nThe organic based fertilizing of a lawn, can be seen as a process of giving ‘healthy food’ to plants, or a diet that makes your plants strong and self-sustaining.

If you know how to make a hydroponic solution at home, it will be very convenient for you to grow plants.\nAdvantages of Hydroponic Systems\nThe hydroponic system is growing in popularity. It allows you to grow any plant anywhere without any natural obstruction.\nHere are the advantages of hydroponic systems.\n- It provides extra oxygen to the plants that stimulate the root growth. So, the nutrients are absorbed faster.\n- The nutrients are mixed with water in the hydroponic system. These nutrients are sent to the root system directly, which doesn’t happen when plants are grown in the soil.\n- Controlling the hydroponic nutrients is possible. So, the plants won’t have a deficiency of nutrients.\n- Controlling every aspect of the growing environment is possible. So, you can control pests, bugs, etc.\nWhen you grow plants using a hydroponic system, you stay indoors. So, you don’t need to sit under the sun for a long time. There is no need to use a garden tiller to prepare the soil. It’s much easier than outdoor gardening. When you grow plants indoors, the quality of air inside your home improves, and there is less chance of having allergy-related diseases.\nMaking Hydroponic Solution at Home\nYou can make a DIY hydroponic solution in two ways.

Hydroponics forms part of hydroculture and is a modern, eco-friendly farming and agricultural practice. The yield rate is very high and plants grow at a faster rate as compared to soil plants.\nHydroponics uses up to 90% less water than traditional farming.

Instead, plants are supported by inert materials like perlite, vermiculite, or coco coir. The plants’ roots are directly exposed to the nutrient solution, ensuring optimal nutrient uptake and growth. This method allows for precise control over the plant’s environment, including nutrient levels, pH balance, and water availability.\n- Essential Components of a Hydroponic System: a. Growing Medium: Instead of soil, hydroponic systems use inert materials as a growing medium. These materials provide support to the plants and hold the nutrient solution for the roots to absorb. Common examples include rockwool, clay pellets, and coconut fiber.\nb. Nutrient Solution: The nutrient solution serves as the primary source of essential minerals and nutrients for plant growth. It contains a carefully balanced mixture of nutrients, including nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and various micronutrients. The solution is recirculated or replenished regularly to ensure the plants receive a consistent supply of nutrients.\nc. Water Supply: Hydroponic systems require a reliable water supply to maintain the nutrient solution and meet the plants’ hydration needs. To minimize water waste, hydroponics uses significantly less water compared to traditional soil-based farming. Additionally, the closed-loop systems in some hydroponic setups recycle and reuse water, further reducing water consumption.\nd. pH and EC Control: Maintaining the correct pH level and electrical conductivity (EC) of the nutrient solution is crucial for plant health. pH levels need to be adjusted to ensure optimal nutrient availability, and EC is monitored to measure the nutrient concentration. This control allows growers to customize the solution to suit different plant species and growth stages.\ne. Lighting: Since hydroponic systems are often used indoors or in controlled environments, artificial lighting plays a crucial role in providing the necessary energy for photosynthesis. LED lights are commonly used due to their energy efficiency and the ability to tailor light spectrums to specific plant requirements.\n- Advantages of Hydroponic Farming: Hydroponic farming offers several advantages over conventional agriculture:\na. Increased Crop Yields: By providing plants with optimal growing conditions, hydroponic systems can result in higher crop yields compared to traditional farming methods.\nb.

The stores understand that our desire for tomatoes demands year-round availability. But what they might not understand is how consumers would react if they learned that some of those organic tomatoes may be hydroponically grown. Last week, this topic was being discussed at the Vermont Organic Farmers annual meeting. And the question was posed, should hydroponic crops be allowed to display the certified organic seal?\nIn order to answer that question, you need to understand the founding principles of the organic farming movement. The original organic farmers and gardeners saw that the use of chemical fertilizer was diminishing soil fertility, which resulted in malnourished plants. The founders of the organic movement recognized that the soil was more than just a structure to hold up plants. Rather, they looked at soil as a critical component of the health of the plant. If they created a “healthy” soil full of microbes, minerals and nutrients, they theorized that the plants grown in this soil would be healthier both in fighting off diseases and pests and by providing more nutrients to the humans and animals that ate them. At the time this idea that the soil was a living ecosystem was revolutionary, as the common practice for growing crops was based on feeding the plant through synthetic fertilizers.\nIn 2002, the USDA developed national standards defining organic farming and processing. As one would expect, these regulations require that organic farmers maintain or improve the biological, chemical, and physical condition of the soil. Ask any organic farmer today and they will most likely describe themselves as stewards of the soil. The soil is their focus. You’ll never hear an organic farmer call their soil dirt! It’s also the focus of the USDA organic regulations and the fact that there is no soil involved in hydroponic production is the reason many people feel it should not be considered organic.\nIn contrast to organic production, hydroponic production is a system of growing crops that intentionally removes soil from the picture. Hydroponic crops are grown using 16 or 17 minerals in the correct proportions.

There are many nutrient companies, and each company creates multiple lines of nutrients and supplements for different purposes.\nThe abundance of cannabis nutrient options can be overwhelming\nAs a cannabis grower, your goal is to give your plants the right amount of nutrients at the right time. There are two main life stages for cannabis plants (vegetative stage and flowering stage). Each stage has different nutrient requirements. Luckily, many nutrient companies make great products even though they’re all using different formulas and techniques. Here’s how they differ:\n- Nutrient Ratios – Each brand has different nutrient ratios they believe are optimal for each stage of growth.\n- Ingredients – There are many different combinations of chemical and organic compounds that can add up to the same nutrient ratios. Each compound reacts differently with each other. This means you can see two nutrient bottles with the exact same NPK ratios on the bottle, but they will provide somewhat different levels of nutrients to your plants. The ingredients determine whether nutrients are considered organic or synthetic.\n- Designed for Soil or Hydro – It’s really important to match your growing medium with your nutrients. “Soil” nutrients are different from “Hydroponic” nutrients so make sure you’re getting the right kind! Coco coir is generally considered a type of hydroponics when it comes to nutrients, though there are also nutrients specifically designed for coco coir. Typically, hydroponic nutrients contain everything a plant needs to grow and can be used in any grow medium.\nImportant Tips on Cannabis Supplements\n- Don’t confuse supplements for nutrients. If the NPK ratios printed on the front of the bottle are really low (like 0.2-0.2-0.1) it means that this product is some type of supplement. Base nutrients provide all the necessary NPK and micronutrients for healthy growth, so supplements are not necessary for plants to thrive.

While the term has historically implied the use of natural fertilisers and the avoidance of synthetic chemicals and pesticides, it has recently been adopted by hydroponic growers as well.\nDepending on your definition, \"organic hydroponic systems\" can be used to grow a variety of plants, including cannabis. However, these systems are substantially more difficult to establish and maintain than non-organic systems. Despite this, the appeal of organically grown product is enough to lure many cannabis growers into the sphere of organic hydroponics.\nTraditional organic farming has long used soil as the growth medium. However, in the modern era, many growers have rejected the use of soil and fertilisers as a defining characteristic of organic growing.\nIn most of the world, for a product to be certified as \"organic\", it must be grown in soil. However, in 2017, the US Department of Agriculture decided to allow some hydroponic and aquaponic crops to be certified as organic. As such, some growers are now adopting these techniques as part of their organic farming programmes.\nThere are valid reasons why many organic growers have stayed away from hydroponics for so long. For starters, many organic nutrients are not fully soluble. They have a tendency to leave behind residual sediment that can build up inside hydroponic systems. These residuals can clog up the system, affecting its ability to grow robust, healthy plants.\nMoreover, organic growing typically requires the use of beneficial microbes, and thick, sticky sugars. Similar to nutrients, these materials tend to leave behind deposits that clog up hydroponic systems. But even worse, having these deposits in your system could lead to the growth of living, thriving bacterial colonies.

These losses have generally been blamed on coastal squeeze resulting from sea level rising against sea walls. There is little evidence to support this hypothesis however, and an alternative hypothesis, based on infaunal invertebrates preventing the establishment of saltmarsh plants was tested. In the managed realignment site at Tollesbury, and the other sites examined, the mudflat fauna was dominated by Nereis (= Hediste) diversicolor and Hydrobia ulvae. In laboratory experiments N. diversicolor and H. ulvae reduced the production of seedlings from seeds of Salicornia europaea agg.. Conversely the presence of S. europaea agg. significantly reduced the normal burrowing activity of N. diversicolor. Invertebrate exclusion experiments established at five sites in south east England facilitated colonisation by saltmarsh plants at some sites (Orplands, the Blythe Estuary, Wallasea Island and Maldon), by excluding large (>3cm) N. diversicolor. However, at the Tollesbury realignment site, the high rate of sediment deposition and the relatively long distance to a source of seeds prevented plant colonisation. This study supports the hypothesis that establishment of saltmarsh vegetation is prevented by infaunal invertebrates,particularly N.diversicolor, which exclude plants through bioturbation, herbivory and granivory. These interactions may help explain the loss of saltmarshes and will reduce the success of future managed realignment schemes which depend upon the colonisation of new intertidal areas by saltmarsh vegetation. Further management of realignment sites will be necessary to encourage saltmarsh development.\nAuthorsParamor, Odette Ay Ling\n- Theses", "score": 0.819584966, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:c3379d58-e611-4ae7-a17f-437d6dbb63c6>", "text": "Salt marsh may have distinct zones of vegetation, each dominated by a single species of grass or rush. Tidal fluctuation is the most important ecological factor in salt marsh communities, cycling nutrients and allowing marine and estuarine fauna access to the marsh. This exchange helps to make salt marsh one of the most biologically productive natural communities in the world. Salt marshes are also extremely important because of their storm buffering capacity and their pollutant filtering actions. The dense roots and stems hold the unstabilized soils together, reducing the impact of storm wave surge. The plants, animals and soils filter, absorb and neutralize many pollutants before they can reach adjacent marine and estuarine communities. These factors make salt marshes extremely valuable as a natural community.\nMangrove Swamp - A mangrove swamp is a dense forest occurring along relatively flat, low wave energy, marine and estuarine shorelines. The dominant plants of mangrove swamp are red mangrove (Rhizophora mangle), black mangrove (Avicennia germinans), white mangrove (Laguncularia racemosa) and buttonwood (Conocarpus erectus). Red mangrove often dominates the lowest (or deep-water) zone, followed by black mangrove in the intermediate zone, and white mangrove and buttonwood in the highest, least tidally influenced zone. The density and height of mangroves and the diversity of associated herbaceous species can vary considerably within a mangrove swamp. Mangroves are vulnerable to cold, with red mangroves the least resistant to freezes.\nComposite Substrate - Composite substrates consist of a combination of natural communities such as \"beds\" of algae and seagrasses or areas with small patches of consolidated and unconsolidated bottom with or without sessile floral and faunal populations. Composite substrates may be dominated by any combination of marine and estuarine sessile flora or fauna, or mineral substrate type. Typical combinations of plants, animals and substrates representing composite substrates include soft and stony corals with sponges on a hard bottom such as a limerock outcrop; algae and seagrasses scattered over a sand bottom; and patch reefs throughout a coralgal bottom.

Traits for competition, environmental and disturbance tolerance often exist in trade-off. Thus, while competitive fitness generally increases up‐shore, some low marsh species compensate for lack of competitive ability by being more tolerant to wave disturbance than high shore species (Pennings and Calloway 1992 ).\nEuropean salt‐marsh distribution and vegetation composition\nAlthough salt‐marshes are not the most diverse ecosystems, due to the influence of the salinity regime, they are highly productive. Along the European coasts salt‐marsh vegetation composition differs between four regions (Figure 3) from which a large area is protected within Natura 2000: 1) North Atlantic; 2) South Atlantic; 3) Mediterranean; 4) Baltic and Boreal regions (European Commission, 2007). A short description of these regional vegetation differences in vegetation composition is given in Table 1, Table 2 and Table 3. In general the salt marshes in North-West Europe can be considered to belong to the North Atlantic. In contrast to the other types, these marshes are mostly exposed to large tidal amplitudes. In general the salt marshes and meadows along the Baltic Sea experience minimal tidal differences, and can be considered micro-tidal. Most of the Baltic and boreal coastal areas were traditionally used for mowing or grazing, thus enlarging the areas and keeping the vegetation low, rich in vascular plants, characteristically the vegetation occurs in distinct zones, with saline vegetation closest to the sea. The Mediterranean and South Atlantic coastal areas consist largely of the same species composition. This is due to the temperature, although Mediterranean species higher up on the shore are usually more dessication resistant. In general the salt marshes and meadows along the Mediterranean experience minimal tidal differences, and can be considered micro‐tidal.\n|Glasswort swards (Thero-Salicornietalia): annual glasswort (Salicornia spp., Microcnemum coralloides), seablite (Suaeda maritima), or sometimes saltwort (Salsola spp.)", "score": 0.815212548, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:684b868f-428e-483f-a05b-0643449fdb5e>", "text": "Nonforested areas in the park are the estuary, wetlands, beach fringe, and historic Tlingit fort site, which is a maintained grass opening enclosed by the surrounding forest.

The degree of alteration changes dependant on rainfall and so season; this is typical of many of our estuaries. Only a limited range of specialist plants and animals can survive this changing environment. The saltmarsh plant and animal species span different conditions, with the species in the lowest areas of saltmarsh able to withstand hours under the salty water as the tide comes in and out. Those species in the upper marsh link into terrestrial (land based) species and can only live for a limited time under the saltwater. This is where the land and the sea meet.\nWhen powerful tide and wind driven waves hit sea walls, the wave bounces back and the energy stays in the estuary making flooding and erosion a far more likely outcome, possibly further along the estuary. When the same tides hit saltmarsh the marsh slows the water and reduces the height of waves; this takes the energy out of it and helps reduce the risk of flooding and erosion elsewhere.\nWe’ve been working with researchers from Cambridge University to study this further and gain a greater understanding of just how effective saltmarsh environments are at taking the power out of the waves. Cambridge University has found that not only is the vegetation an important element in reducing wave and tidal energy, but also the geomorphology of creeks and rough saltmarsh (sediment) surfaces are important too. This is not only true for Spring tides, where less than a meter depth of water is above the saltmarsh surface, but also under storm surges where tide levels can be raised by more than a meter above that, so a few meters above the saltmarsh surface.\nHealthy saltmarshes are effective at locking up carbon and helping to reduce the effects of climate change.

It is dominated by dense stands of salt-tolerant plants such as herbs, grasses, or low shrubs. These plants are terrestrial in origin and are essential to the stability of the salt marsh in trapping and binding sediments. Salt marshes play a large role in the aquatic food web and the delivery of nutrients to coastal waters. They also support terrestrial animals and provide coastal protection.\nSalt marshes occur on low-energy shorelines in temperate and high-latitudes which can be stable or emerging, or submerging if the sedimentation rate exceeds the subsidence rate. Commonly these shorelines consist of mud or sand flats (known also as tidal flats or abbreviated to mudflats) which are nourished with sediment from inflowing rivers and streams. These typically include sheltered environments such as embankments, estuaries and the leeward side of barrier islands and spits. In the tropics and sub-tropics they are replaced by mangroves; an area that differs from a salt marsh in that instead of herbaceous plants, they are dominated by salt-tolerant trees.\nMost salt marshes have a low topography with low elevations but a vast wide area, making them hugely popular for human populations. Salt marshes are located among different landforms based on their physical and geomorphological settings. Such marsh landforms include deltaic marshes, estuarine, back-barrier, open coast, embayments and drowned-valley marshes. Deltaic marshes are associated with large rivers where many occur in Southern Europe such as the Camargue, France in the Rhone delta or the Ebro delta in Spain. They are also extensive within the rivers of the Mississippi Delta in the United States. In New Zealand, most salt marshes occur at the head of estuaries in areas where there is little wave action and high sedimentation. Such marshes are located in Awhitu Regional Park in Auckland, the Manawatu Estuary, and the Avon-Heathcote Estuary in Christchurch. Back-barrier marshes are sensitive to the reshaping of barriers in the landward side of which they have been formed.", "score": 0.812802255, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:12d96752-43a4-4a99-8c55-d96e55c537c9>", "text": "In low marsh areas with high tidal flooding, a monoculture of the smooth cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora dominate, then heading landwards, zones of the salt hay, Spartina patens, black rush, Juncus gerardii and the shrub Iva frutescens are seen respectively. These species all have different tolerances that make the different zones along the marsh best suited for each individual.\nPlant species diversity is relatively low, since the flora must be tolerant of salt, complete or partial submersion, and anoxic mud substrate. The most common salt marsh plants are glassworts (Salicornia spp.) and the cordgrass (Spartina spp.), which have worldwide distribution. They are often the first plants to take hold in a mudflat and begin its ecological succession into a salt marsh. Their shoots lift the main flow of the tide above the mud surface while their roots spread into the substrate and stabilize the sticky mud and carry oxygen into it so that other plants can establish themselves as well. Plants such as sea lavenders (Limonium spp.), plantains (Plantago spp.), and varied sedges and rushes grow once the mud has been vegetated by the pioneer species.\nSalt marshes are quite photosynthetically active and are extremely productive habitats. They serve as depositories for a large amount of organic matter and are full of decomposition, which feeds a broad food chain of organisms from bacteria to mammals. Many of the halophytic plants such as cordgrass are not grazed at all by higher animals but die off and decompose to become food for micro-organisms, which in turn become food for fish and birds.\nSediment trapping, accretion, and the role of tidal creeksEdit\nThe factors and processes that influence the rate and spatial distribution of sediment accretion within the salt marsh are numerous. Sediment deposition can occur when marsh species provide a surface for the sediment to adhere to, followed by deposition onto the marsh surface when the sediment flakes off at low tide. The amount of sediment adhering to salt marsh species is dependent on the type of marsh species, the proximity of the species to the sediment supply, the amount of plant biomass, and the elevation of the species.", "score": 0.812665045, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:752ee150-4188-4788-a0c8-008b6c338d16>", "text": "- Does lime lower pH in soil?\n- Do coffee grounds make soil more acidic?\n- What happens if plants have too much nitrogen?\n- Why is my soil pH so low?\n- What should be added in the soil when it is too acidic?\n- Does nitrogen raise or lower pH?\n- Does nitrogen affect water pH?\n- What happens when soil pH is too low?\n- What causes a high pH in soil?\n- What is the fastest way to lower pH in soil?\n- What do you do if your soil has high pH?\n- What causes low pH in soil?\n- Is low pH bad for plants?\n- How do you lower pH in potting soil?\n- Does urea increase soil pH?\nDoes lime lower pH in soil?\nWhat is lime.\nLime is a soil amendment made from ground limestone rock, which naturally contains calcium carbonate and magnesium carbonate.\nWhen lime is added to soil, these compounds work to increase the soil’s pH, making soil less acidic and more alkaline..\nDo coffee grounds make soil more acidic?\nUsed coffee grounds are neutral.” If you rinse your used coffee grounds, they will have a near neutral pH of 6.5 and will not affect the acid levels of the soil.

Adequate nitrogen soil content is necessary for healthy plants. All plants require nitrogen for healthy growth and reproduction. More importantly, plants use nitrogen for photosynthesis. While native plants are better adapted to their surroundings and oftentimes less affected by nitrogen deficiency, in plants such as vegetable crops, supplemental nitrogen may be required.\nNitrogen Deficiency in Plants\nGood crops depend on an adequate supply of nitrogen. Most nitrogen is naturally present in the soil as organic content. Nitrogen deficiency in plants is more likely to occur in soils that are low in organic content. However, nitrogen loss due to erosion, runoff and leaching of nitrate can also cause nitrogen deficiency in plants.\nSome of the most common symptoms of nitrogen deficiency in plants include the yellowing and dropping of leaves and poor growth. Flowering or fruit production may also be delayed.\nNitrogen Requirements for Plants\nAs organic matter decomposes, nitrogen is slowly converted to ammonium, which is absorbed by plant roots. Excess ammonium is turned into nitrate, which plants also use to produce protein. However, unused nitrates remain in the groundwater, resulting in leaching of the soil.\nSince nitrogen requirements for plants vary, supplemental nitrogen fertilizer should only be used in the correct proportion. Always check the nitrogen analysis on chemical fertilizer packaging to determine the percentage amount of nitrogen present. This is the first of three numbers on the package (10-30-10).\nRaising Soil Nitrogen\nThere are several ways to add nitrogen to soil. Supplemental nitrogen is usually provided by using organic or chemical fertilizers. Plants obtain nitrogen through compounds containing ammonium or nitrate. Both of these can be given to plants through chemical fertilizers. Using chemical fertilizer to add nitrogen to soil is faster; however, it is more prone to leaching, which can be harmful to the environment.\nBuilding up levels of organic matter in the soil is another way of raising soil nitrogen. This can be achieved by using organic fertilizer in the form of compost or manure. Growing legumes can also supplement soil nitrogen. Although organic fertilizer must be broken down in order to release compounds containing ammonium and nitrate, which is much slower, using organic fertilizer to add nitrogen to soil is safer for the environment.\nHigh Nitrogen in Soil\nToo much nitrogen present in the soil can be just as harmful to plants as too little.", "score": 0.0001670460023570839, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:c9f4603f-2c5e-487a-8bc3-ae9372aba861>", "text": "When we talk about water parameters and optimum levels, this is all based around the nitrogen cycle which takes place in our fish tanks.

For example, plants growing in nitrogen-poor soils will use carbon-based defenses (mostly digestibility reducers), while those growing in low-carbon environments (such as shady conditions) are more likely to produce nitrogen-based toxins. The hypothesis further predicts that plants can change their defenses in response to changes in nutrients. For example, if plants are grown in low-nitrogen conditions, then these plants will implement a defensive strategy composed of constitutive carbon-based defenses. If nutrient levels subsequently increase, by for example the addition of fertilizers, these carbon-based defenses will decrease.\nGrowth rate hypothesis\nThe growth rate hypothesis, also known as the resource availability hypothesis, states that defense strategies are determined by the inherent growth rate of the plant, which is in turn determined by the resources available to the plant. A major assumption is that available resources are the limiting factor in determining the maximum growth rate of a plant species. This model predicts that the level of defense investment will increase as the potential of growth decreases. Additionally, plants in resource-poor areas, with inherently slow-growth rates, tend to have long-lived leaves and twigs, and the loss of plant appendages may result in a loss of scarce and valuable nutrients.\nA recent test of this model involved a reciprocal transplants of seedlings of 20 species of trees between clay soils (nutrient rich) and white sand (nutrient poor) to determine whether trade-offs between growth rate and defenses restrict species to one habitat. When planted in white sand and protected from herbivores, seedlings originating from clay outgrew those originating from the nutrient-poor sand, but in the presence of herbivores the seedlings originating from white sand performed better, likely due to their higher levels of constitutive carbon-based defenses. These finding suggest that defensive strategies limit the habitats of some plants.\nGrowth-differentiation balance hypothesis\nThe growth-differentiation balance hypothesis states that plant defenses are a result of a tradeoff between \"growth-related processes\" and \"differentiation-related processes\" in different environments. Differentiation-related processes are defined as \"processes that enhance the structure or function of existing cells (i.e. maturation and specialization).\" A plant will produce chemical defenses only when energy is available from photosynthesis, and plants with the highest concentrations of secondary metabolites are the ones with an intermediate level of available resources.", "score": 0.00011554039830712235, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:611dcd03-a0a5-4f4c-8a6c-93a83abd03dc>", "text": "An established technology is helping remove harmful nutrients from municipal wastewater\n- By David C. Slack\n- Sep 01, 2006\nAs total maximum daily loads (TMDLs) for nutrient discharges have been developed\nand further revised by federal and state agencies over the years to address water\nquality concerns, deep-bed denitrification filters have proven to be a highly\neffective treatment technology used by wastewater plants to meet low total nitrogen\n(TN) limits. Patented in 1979, the technology of combining denitrification and\nsolids removal in a deep-bed filter process has helped to dramatically improve\nwastewater quality at treatment plants across the country.\nAmmonia, Nitrogen and Phosphorus\nOn a daily basis, nitrogen consumed as protein in our food, but unused in our\nbodies, is excreted in the form of ammonia. Since ammonia and total nitrogen\nare highly toxic to fish and other animals, levels in wastewater treatment and\neffluent discharges must be closely monitored to ensure the nutrient levels\nare not harmful to receiving streams.\nTherefore, the wastewater quality-monitoring process is critical to ensuring\neffluent discharge levels that are safe for wildlife.

The denitrification\nprocess requirements are: a) nitrogen present in the form of nitrates; b) an\norganic carbon source; and c) an anoxic environment. Denitrification can be\nachieved through chemical or biological methods.\nSpecific to fixed-film technology, denitrification configurations are\ntypically available as downflow or upflow filters. Both configurations require\nthe addition of methanol (or another readily biodegradable carbon source to\nwastewater ahead of the filter to enable denitrifying bacteria to grow).\nWastewater treatment plants have been designed to convert ammonia, via\naeration, into nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N).

These numbers mean that the bag contains 15 percent nitrogen, 5 percent phosphorus and 10 percent potassium. The remaining 70 percent of the material in the bag is filler. That can be hydrogen, oxygen and other compound parts but can also be just about anything – sawdust, sand, dirt or even toxic industrial waste.\nNow you might ask, ‘Why do we need filler? They distribute the N-P-K throughout the filler or carrier so you don’t burn the heck out of your turf when you apply it. Does that tell you something?\nWhen we use organic fertilizers we’re using very low amounts of buffered nutrients. Everything in the bag is useful to the plant. Our ‘filler’ is organic material with a variety of trace minerals. That translates to much better stimulation of biological activity in the soil.\nThere are all kinds of problems with synthetic, high-nitrogen fertilizers. The primary problem is that there’s too much nitrogen. It creates an unbalanced situation as far as nutrients in the soil and in plants.\nHigh levels of nitrogen and low levels of trace minerals force fast growth that results in very weak watery cell growth in plants. People see the plants are growing and flowering so they think everything is fine. But the imbalance and the watery cells bring on insects and diseases. Nature’s job is to take out sick plants and to encourage the survival of the fittest.\nAnd, the form of nitrogen is wrong. It works too fast. Plus, it’s soluble. If it rains after you put it out, it washes away and leaches through the soil into the water stream.\nThe second problem is the phosphorous source. The phosphorous in synthetic fertilizer is usually triple super phosphate 0-46-0 made by treating rock phosphate with phosphoric acid. Years ago the phosphorous source was 0-20-0 or super phosphate. It was pretty darn good even though it was created by a synthetic process. Rock phosphate was made by treatment with with sulfuric acid. It was a more balanced phosphate and did not tie up trace minerals.", "score": 8.745140238001195e-05, "source": "sparse"}]}

Penetration testing is one of the most common (and often required) ways to assess cybersecurity risks. It’s hard to underestimate the role of penetration testing in risk evaluation: thorough testing helps you identify, assess, and prioritize risks.\nIn this article, we discuss three common types of security testing for risk assessment and determine their pros, cons, and use cases. We also investigate types and stages of pentesting and share best practices to make a cybersecurity risk assessment effective and painless.\nRisk assessment is a process that includes:\n- identifying vulnerabilities, threats, and risks that can cause any sort of damage to the organization\n- estimating the probability of risks being realized\n- defining mitigation priorities by risk severity and the likelihood of occurrence\nIn risk management, assessment is preceded by framing (establishing the context of risks) and followed by responding to and monitoring these risks.\nAssessing risks and threats is one of the most important steps to improving cybersecurity. It’s an ongoing process that helps you evaluate your security controls, detect issues, and estimate their impact. There are several major reasons for conducting an assessment:\n- To prevent hacks, data breaches, and data loss. A periodic review of cybersecurity controls allows you to detect and close off vulnerabilities before hackers can exploit them.\n- To examine network security. An independent risk assessment provides an unbiased examination of your network’s security controls. It helps you update knowledge on your protected environment, especially after significant changes like deploying new software, installing new hardware, or moving to a new location.\n- To improve decision-making. Determining the impact of discovered risks is an important part of a risk assessment. This information is useful for making further decisions related to cybersecurity: budgeting, planning improvements, prioritizing fixes, etc.\n- To reduce spending on cybersecurity. An assessment is a time- and cost-consuming procedure. But in the long term, it can save you from more severe losses by preventing data breaches, hacks, and compliance violations.\n- To ensure compliance. Risk management is part of many laws, regulations, and standards including NIST Special Publications, HIPAA, PCI DSS, and GDPR. Failing to comply with those that are relevant to your business may lead to substantial fines.\nThe procedure and tools for risk assessment are unique for each organization and project. However, there are three stages that must be implemented in any case.", "score": 0.811606586, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:8b2277a5-dec6-43fd-806d-8e61615788aa>", "text": "Business impact and risk assessments in IT disaster recovery planning\nThere are many things to consider when discussing business risk assessments and impact assessments in disaster recovery planning.

Such a report concludes the risk assessment process and usually includes:\n- Discovered vulnerabilities (if scanning for them was included in the scope of pentesting)\n- A description of the methodology and tools used during testing\n- A list of exploits (both used and possible)\n- Analysis of the risks these exploits may pose\n- An assessment of the possible business impact of the discovered risks\nWith this report, you can proceed to the next stages of risk management: risk mitigation and control. For example, using pentesting results, you can:\n- Assess the current state of security controls\n- Observe how your security team reacts to a hacker attack\n- Make the case for increasing your cybersecurity budget\n- Define and prioritize security improvements\n- Create hotfixes and take long-lasting mitigation actions\nAs we can see, pentesting is a great method for assessing cybersecurity controls and risks. But it’s important to keep in mind the risks of penetration testing. Let’s find out about them in the next section.\nIf conducted by an inexperienced tester or without due attention, penetration testing can bring more damage than benefits. You need to consider the major drawbacks of this testing before conducting it.\nHere are some key penetration testing risks:\n- The high cost of a mistake. Pentesters work with sensitive data and infrastructure. If tests aren’t carried out properly, they can crash servers and expose or corrupt data. It’s a security risk to be considered, especially during black-box testing.\n- Unrealistic conditions and biased results. If your security team knows about an upcoming test or conducts the test themselves, they may prepare for it. The point of any security assessment is to get a reality check and prioritize future improvements. If pentesting is conducted in an unrealistic environment, there’s little hope for meaningful results.\n- Time and scope limitations. As with any process, there’s a technical task for pentesting and a due date for preparing a report. This limits the number of exploits pentesters can use, especially if you employ a third-party testing organization.

By providing an increased understanding of security weaknesses, penetration testing enables resources to be allocated more efficiently to protect areas most at risk. Its importance is highlighted by a growing need to undertake regular security assessments in order to achieve compliance with regulations such as PCI-DSS.\nThe difference between a penetration test and a vulnerability scan\nBefore commissioning the services of a managed security provider like Redscan to examine your organisation’s defences, it’s a good idea to think about the type of test you would like performed.\nPenetration tests are routinely confused with vulnerability assessments – the two terms are often used interchangeably. Both services are actually very different however and knowing the difference before engaging with providers can help you to avoid getting caught out.\nA penetration test utilises a combination of machine and human-led intelligence to identify and, crucially, exploit wide-ranging gaps in defences. A vulnerability scan, on the other hand, is a more restricted test performed using off-the-shelf scanning tools to search for known vulnerabilities, such as out-of-date software and incorrect registry entries.\nWhile good for identifying common risks, a vulnerability scan is generally no substitute for a more comprehensive penetration test performed by a skilled ethical hacker capable of thinking outside the box.\nIf your organisation is at an early stage of cyber security maturity then a vulnerability assessment, followed by an-depth penetration test, could be the most efficient route to effective risk mitigation.\nHow to scope a penetration test\nPrior to a penetration test being agreed, it’s important to think about scope. This will largely depend upon what you’re hoping to achieve. Do you want to comprehensively test your organisation’s complete attack surface or, in order to reduce the length of an engagement, restrict an assessment to a particular aspect of your security?\nDeciding whether the test should include internal and external assets is a good starting point. External penetration tests encompass testing of a company’s externally visible servers or devices such as email and webservers and firewalls. An internal test is conducted behind a firewall and is useful for gauging how much damage could be inflicted by an insider attack, such as one instigated by a disgruntled employee.", "score": 0.024934185406308557, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:f972f07b-b101-435f-a4aa-25915ec3497b>", "text": "The most popular ones are:\n- Penetration Testing Execution Standard\n- OWASP Web Application Penetration Checklist [PDF]\n- PCI DSS Penetration Testing Guidance [PDF]\n- CREST Penetration Testing Guide [PDF]\n5. Halt development processes when pentesting.\nPentesting uncovers threats and risks within some context in the environment. If you decide to change existing parameters or deploy new software during the test, it will jeopardize the result. It’s best to finish your development activities before the test to include new pieces of the environment in the testing scope.\n6. Review the integrity of security measures and data after the test.\nAfter the test, the testing team should cover their tracks: close created backdoors, delete exploitation scripts and temporary files, reverse settings changes, etc. However, you should double-check that:\n- Security holes created for testing purposes are closed\n- User accounts for testers are deleted\n- Compromised credentials are changed\nIf you choose a highly skilled testing team, use the practices we’ve listed above, and implement controls to mitigate discovered risks, you’ll take your cybersecurity to another level!\n7. Don’t neglect remediation measures.\nPenetration testing vendors often provide suggestions for risk remediation in their reports. If testing is conducted rarely (once a year or less) or includes a large scope of tasks, it will probably uncover lots of critical risks, and remediation actions will require a substantial amount of time and money.\nOf course, in order to cut costs, you can postpone remediation or fix only the most critical issues. But if you feel you don’t have enough resources to act upon the results of pentesting, it’s best to limit yourself to internal vulnerability scanning instead of conducting a full-scale pentest.\nRisk assessment is a hard-to-execute but vital part of the risk management process. It helps you identify, assess, and prioritize the mitigation of an organization’s cybersecurity risks. There are a lot of methods for conducting a risk assessment, including penetration testing, red team testing, and risk-based testing. But it’s hard to underestimate the importance of penetration testing in this process: it allows for complex evaluation of security controls and simulating a real-world attack on the protected environment.\nAt Apriorit, we have vast experience conducting both penetration and security testing.

His last words, reportedly, were, “I am going to a beautiful, peaceful country.”\nWhen “Flora Japonica” appeared, those lucky enough to have seen it may have thought Siebold exaggerated the beauty of the plants, but a young American botanist named Asa Gray saw something else.\nGray sailed to Europe in 1838, when he was 28, to meet some of the great botanists of his day. In Munich, he met Siebold’s co-author, J.G. Zuccarini, who gave Gray a copy of “Flora Japonica” as a gift. Gray, who spent his career at Harvard, saw the strange kinship between many Japanese species and those native to the eastern United States.\nHe developed a view that tallied with the evolutionary theories of Charles Darwin. The two corresponded, and Darwin told him of his theory of natural selection a year before releasing “On the Origin of Species” in 1859. In the same year, Gray published his own theory that plants from Japan and the eastern United States share a common ancestry.\nOne obvious example was Virginia creeper, an American native, and Boston ivy, from Japan. There were obvious parallels, too, between Japanese and American pachysandra, rhododendron, viburnum and stewartia, to name a few.

Australian populations which occur as weeds, having different flowers, for example in Warraroon Reserve, Lane Cove, Sydney, further south than the natural distribution of M. affine, are introduced plants of this M. malabathricum L. species.\n- Malabar Melastome\n- Melastoma malabathricum - Flora of China\n- Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN)\n- Melastoma malabathricum (L.)

A specimen of a peculiar plant was detected in the herbarium of the elder Michaux, who collected it (as his autograph ticket shows) somewhere in the high Alleghany Mountains more than eighty years ago. No one has seen the living plant since, or knows where to find it, if haply it still flourishes in some secluded spot. At length it is found in Japan; and I had the satisfaction of making the identification. One other relative is also shown in Japan; and another has just been detected in Thibet. Whether the Japanese and the Alleghanian plants are exactly the same or not, it needs complete specimens of the two to settle. So far as we know, they are just alike. And even if some difference came to be known between them, it would not appreciably alter the question as to how such a result came to pass.\nEach and every one of the analogous cases I have been detailing—and of which I could adduce very many more—raises the same question, and would be satisfied with the same answer. These singular relations attracted my curiosity early in the course of my botanical studies, when comparatively few of them were known, and my serious attention in later years, when I had numerous and new Japanese plants to study in the collections made (by Morris, Williams, and Morrow) during Commodore Perry's visit in 1853, and especially, by Mr. Charles Wright, in Commodore Rodgers's expedition in 1855. I then discussed this subject somewhat fully, and translated the facts within my reach. This was before I ever had developed the rich fossil botany of the arctic zone, before the immense antiquity of existing species of plants was recognized, and before the publication of Darwin's now famous volume on the \"Origin of Species\" had introduced and familiarized the scientific world with those now current ideas respecting the history of species, with which I attempted to deal in a moderate and feeble way.

It could be implied that the decisions of NFR supports Katie’s human rights. If it is considered that Katie’s quality of life would remain poor or that resuscitation could potentially cause her harm and not be in Katie’s best interests then it could be implied that resuscitation in the event of Katie experiencing a cardiac arrest could prove a degrading treatment (Thompson et al, 2006).\nIn this particular scenario Katie’s mother is accusing the health care professionals of being negligent. The case of (Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee ) initiated the Bolam test. The Bolam test is used to examine if a health care professional has been negligent. If the health care professional has acted in accordance with an accepted practice which is approved by a recognised professional body then they cannot be thought as negligent. However, it could be disputed that the health care professional could be assumed negligent if they resuscitated Katie since it is not in her best interests as the health care professionals have a legal duty of care to preclude acts or omissions which can potentially injure the patient (Donogue v Stevenson ). If the health care professionals were to resuscitate Katie and it resulted in her becoming harmed then the health care professionals could be accused of being negligent under the Bolam test. Once a decision such as NFR has been justified and documented then if Katie was resuscitated in the event of a cardiac arrest then this treatment could been seen as battery and it is unlawful as in the case of (Airedale NHS Trust v Bland ).\nSuch as in the case of Bland where the patient’s recovery was not going to happen due to him being in a Permanent Vegetative State, then the courts can decide that treatment can be withdrawn and not infringe the human rights of the individual (NHS Trust v M ). In this scenario the health care team have decided, that due to Katie’s ongoing chest infections, the pain that she experiences from her conditions and her poor quality of life, it would not be in Katie’s best interests for her to be resuscitated in the event of a cardiac arrest.", "score": 0.821861267, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:c9c72f68-072b-45fe-9cb5-3fee2281207d>", "text": "Healthcare and decision-making in dementia\nConsent to medical treatment\nIn Malta, there is no legislation that deals with the consent to treatment issue comprehensively.\nThe Constitution has no express reference to the duty of obtaining informed consent, but the notion can be found in the general context of this fundamental law.\nMalta is expected to sign and ratify the Council of Europe Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine in the near future, following which the relevant articles relating to informed consent and research will apply to Malta.\nThe Data Protection Act that makes provisions for the protection of the individuals against the violation of their privacy by processing of personal data and for matters connected defines \"consent\" as \"any freely given specific and informed indication of the wishes of the data subject by which he signifies his agreement to personal data relating to him being processed.”\nThe \"Patients' Charter of Rights and Responsibilities\" issued by the Hospital Management Committee refers to informed consent to be given by a patient in hospital.\nIt states that hospitalized patients have the right to receive clear information concerning their medical condition, to make their own informed decision for treatment, to be well informed and completely free to accept, decline or withdraw any diagnostic or treatment procedure.\nThe \"Patients’ Charter\" issued by the Malta College of Family Doctors refers to the right of a patient to give or withhold their consent to medical or other care and treatment.\nConsent to treatment in the case of incapacity\nThe \"Patients' Charter of Rights and Responsibilities\" states that “under certain circumstances (e.g. children, people with mental disability or dementia) parents or an appointed representative should be fully informed in order to take decisions on behalf of the patient.\nIf the person is declared by a Court sentence as incapacitated the tutor appointed is the person in charge of giving consent on his/her behalf.\nThe Mental Health Act (Act XVIII of 1976 and subsequent amendments) rules the compulsory admission for observation or for treatment of a patient in pursuance of an application for that purpose.

It pays hospitals only for a specific number of days of care for each patient, based on the diagnosis (DRG) made when he enters the hospital. If the patient is able to leave the hospital sooner, the hospital makes money. If he is slower to recover than expected, the hospital loses money or pressures the doctor to push the patient out anyway.\nHow well these plans can succeed rests on several shaky assumption: That people have been getting and paying for substantial amounts of unnecessary medical care. That business management techniques can cut out this waste--and even yield a profit. And that even though financial incentives lured physicians to overtreat in the past, they will not now undertreat patients, even if it is profitable to do so.\nPatients supposedly have some protections under the new systems. Competition among HMOs, PPOs and hospitals is not only supposed to keep prices down but quality of care high. Peer review processes are intended to prevent gross mistreatment. And it is in the financial interest of caregivers to treat patients efficiently, early on, to avoid a need for more expensive care--and possibly malpractice suits--later.\nBut the new systems also mean patients need to be better informed, to safeguard themselves in the changing world of ``managed medicine.`` People who join an HMO or PPO should find out how physicians are paid, how their financial incentives work and where they may be tempted to skimp on care. They should look for opportunities to develop as close a physician-patient relationship as possible. They should make full use of second--sometimes even third--opinions to double-check on proposals for their care. They should report inadequate treatment to employers and insurers. And they should support peer review processes and oppose attempts to weaken them or to undermine them with legal actions.\nUltimately, of course, the health care system depends on the skill, energy and integrity of caregivers, particularly physicians.

Equestrian portraits by European classical painters like Vasquez, Titian and Van Dyck show saddles bearing close resemblance to the modern Peruvian saddle. When the Spanish Conquistadors arrived in America, they brought with them their European riding equipment. This was modified over the years in accordance with the uses to which the horses were put, and the availability of certain materials. In Peru the need was to essentially maintain the features of a comfortable and secure saddle, as horses were mainly used for transportation. This gave rise to the Peruvian montura de cajón or box saddle, thus named because the rider sits \"boxed in\" between the pommel and cantle.\nThe saddle consists of a wooden frame (saddle tree) with a moderately high pommel and cantle. The tree is covered with tight-fitting pieces of rawhide, with the cinch, stirrups, crupper, breeching buckles and straps attached to the frame. To make the saddle more comfortable and protect the rider’s legs from rubbing against the buckles and straps, leather skirts are usually placed over the saddle tree and around the pommel and cantle. These skirts are often embossed with the beautiful designs for which Peruvian leather artisans have become famous.\nWork saddles that do not have skirts use a leather pad, called pellonera, as a seat cushion. The pellonera can also be used for added comfort over saddles with skirts.\nTo give saddles a better appearance, the pommel and cantle are sometimes covered with fine leather. More ornate saddles have rivets of nickel or silver on the borders of the pommel and cantle and along the edges of the skirts.\nThe carona is a thick leather pad that goes under the saddle and over the blanket, and is decorated with the same motifs as the saddle skirt. Besides enhancing the appearance of the saddle, it protects the back of the horse from the weight of the rider and also shields the saddle from the horse’s sweat.\nTo compliment Peruvian show tack, and as a sign of wealth and good taste, a pellón is sometimes used.", "score": 0.807481229, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:8295dd94-5c3d-4278-bdff-c44b3cb25d81>", "text": "Although cognitive enhancers may be used in sport populations for ‘athletic-performance-enhancing reasons’ in general these substances are not taken for this reason and are predominantly used to enhance other functions in daily life (e.g., the use of Modafinil by pilots to boost alertness and manage fatigue), and, therefore, are not included in the overall PIED category.\nWe also need to consider: what separates HEDs from NPSs and traditional drugs? HEDs are used for different reasons (e.g., to enhance sport performance) than other illicit drugs and NPSs (e.g., to get ‘high’), and users of HEDs often do not necessarily perceive themselves as ‘drug users’. Specifically, HEDs are often used to enhance or to increase the value or perception of human attributes or abilities (e.g., muscle growth, skin darkening), and are not used to provide gratification or pleasure as a result of their ‘psychoactive properties’. Nonetheless, some overlap may be found between the three different drug markets. First of all, let’s look at the difference between NPSs and HEDs. Key features of NPSs are that they are: (1) not approved for human consumption and have unpredictable side-effects, (2) are often sold as something else such as plant chemicals and bath salts, (3) are relatively unknown to health care providers and other professionals, (4) are usually not mentioned in the scientific literature, (5) are easily available (in particular online), and (6) when they are a medical product, these substances are often not used according to medical guidelines (e.g., prescribed dosage). Therefore, NPSs and HEDs share many features such as the perceived ‘legal status’, their (online) availability, being promoted and sold online as legal alternatives, and in that there are certain HEDs created to ‘mimic’ the effects of traditional HEDs. For example, ‘designers steroids’ are created to mimic the effects of existing steroids and are made to evade detection (e.g., doping controls) and legal prohibition. Nonetheless, NPSs and HEDs are heterogeneous in terms of their chemical group, desired effects, type of users, consumption patterns, medical risks and psychopathological disturbances.", "score": 0.10476638044970023, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:8295dd94-5c3d-4278-bdff-c44b3cb25d81>", "text": "Indeed, in general HEDs are not ‘new’, in many instances they have been approved for human consumption, are not usually used for their psychoactive effects, and in most countries are controlled for by drug, medicine or other laws.\nSecond, certain HEDs overlap with the traditional drug market in the sense that similar drugs are used, albeit for different reasons. For example, marijuana is used as a HED for its weight-losing properties (although there is no strong evidence to support this), while this substance likewise may be used as a traditional drug for relaxation purposes. Another example is cocaine, although predominately used as a recreational drug (e.g., produces feeling of euphoria and wellbeing), it is also sometimes used for its performance enhancement effects (e.g., increases alertness with low doses) or weight-loss purposes (e.g., appetite suppressant). Finally, an overlap may even be found between illicit drugs, NPSs and even HEDs. For example, nalbuphine (Nubain) and Gamma Hydroxybutyrate (GHB) cross all three groups. Taking a closer look at GHB: this ‘club drug’ is used as a recreational drug for its intoxicating, euphoria, and sedative effects, while at the same time it is used by bodybuilders and other weight-trainers for its anabolic effects due to protein synthesis. However, there is no strong scientific evidence to support that GHB works for these enhancement purposes. In addition, although GHB has been used as a recreational drug since the 1990s, this substances and its analogues gamma-butyrolactone (GBL) been classified in the literature as a NPS.\nFigure 1 provides an overview of our discussion; the different types of HEDs, what are considered PIEDs, and how this connects to the traditional drug market and the illicit market of NPSs.

Where before traditional drugs such as cannabis and cocaine were the main go to for recreational drug users, there is now an emergence of ‘new’ drugs that have similar effects, called ‘novel psychoactive substances‘ (NPSs) or ‘legal highs’. NPSs are drugs which are designed to be similar chemically and/or pharmacologically to known controlled drugs (e.g., cocaine), are substances related to medicine, and are often sold (online) as ‘safer’ and ‘legal’ alternatives to traditional drugs. The growing demand for NPS and its rapid diffusion in countries around the world, is currently one of the main challenges needing to be addressed by drug policies. However, while countries across the globe are responding to this emerging NPS issue and are introducing laws to control this unregulated market, another rapidly rising illicit drug market has remained relatively ignored: the market for human enhancement drugs (HEDs). The only exception being in the context of sports doping, where drugs such as steroids, have been recognized as a threat to the health of athletes and the morality of sport for some time now.\nIndeed, the emerging threat to public health posed by the use of HEDs has been largely ignored (e.g., cardiovascular disease, dependence, mood syndromes, skin infections), and little research and, therefore, a lack of knowledge, exists surrounding the prevalence of HED use, its effects and health harms, and its supply. Nevertheless, academics, practitioners, the news media and others have begun to pay attention to the sale and consumption of HEDs. However, the ways in which these sources conceptualize and operationalize HEDs differ widely: some consider HEDs as a part of NPSs, while others define them as ‘lifestyle drugs’ or performance and image enhancing drugs (PIEDs). In addition, it is not always clear to what type of substance are specifically being referred to when talking about HEDs (e.g., steroids, weight-loss drugs). Yet, in order to draw comparisons and to measure research variables it is essential to be clear about what we mean by HEDs and what types of HEDs we are talking about.", "score": 0.0022402734250784526, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:9bc3c49c-a267-4f33-8fdc-d0053a41fb40>", "text": "Dutch Warmblood - Horse Breed & Info\nDutch Warmblood Article and Photos Copyrighted - see credits below\nThe Dutch Warmblood is an appealing, modern horse with good character and health, bred to perform for years in all disciplines. Their willingness, reliability, intelligence and conformation have made them beloved by riders everywhere.\nThe beginnings of the Dutch Warmblood were found in two areas of the Netherlands, Gelderland and Gronigen. In Gelderland, the soil is sandy and a lighter type of horse developed. In Groningen, the soil is heavy clay and a much heavier type of horse developed, derived from the Friesian and Oldenburg.\nTo refine their horse, the Groningen breeders used Gelderlanders, while the Gelderlanders wanting to add more mass to their horses, used Groningern blood. Using these fine old established bloodlines to produce a true riding horse, farmers applied strict breeding practices, with a lot of severe culling.\nTo produce the modern Dutch Warmblood, Thoroughbreds were introduced along with stallions from France, Holstein, Hanover and Trakehners.\nTHE MODERN WARMBLOOD\nOver the years the modern KWPN (Koninklijke Vereniging Warmbloed Paarden-stamboek Nederland) has overseen both riding and carriage horses, with a small group of breeders remaining dedicated to the original farm type of light draft horse.\nThe Dutch Warmbloods are high achievers, but have not been permitted to lose good conformation, beauty or the charm that have made these horses famous. Rigid selection and testing procedures are followed. Only the best of the best stallions come under consideration for the classification keur, with preference being awarded to famous individuals.\nThe Dutch have produced a horse that is durable and a loyal partner no matter what he is asked to perform.\nThe brand used by the Dutch Stud Book (KWPN) is that of a proud Dutch lion and the character of the horses match completely.\nThe chest of this horse is deep and full with a well sloped shoulder.

This blog is a ‘living document’, meaning that it hopes to evolve and change over time as we work towards a greater understanding of HEDs.\nHEDs are often used in an attempt to become faster, stronger and smarter, to look thinner, to increase happiness, to ‘reverse’ ageing, and various other reasons related to improving the quality of life and to enhance human attributes or abilities. Specifically, HEDs can be divided into six categories: (a) muscle drugs (MDs) (e.g., steroids), (b) weight-loss drugs (WDs) (e.g., ephedrine), (c) image enhancers (IE) (e.g., skin-lightening products), (d) sexual enhancers (SEs) (e.g., Viagra), (e) cognitive enhancers (CEs) (e.g. Adderall), and (f) mood and social behaviour enhancers (MBEs) (e.g., Diazepam). (a) Muscle drugs are used to enhance the structure and function of skeletal muscle. These substances are consumed for cosmetic reasons (e.g., increase muscle definition), medical reasons (e.g., to increase weight in AIDS patients), and to enhance physical performance (e.g., increase strength). Examples of muscle drugs are anabolic androgenic steroids (AAS), human growth hormone (HGH) and Erythropoietin (EPO). It should also be noted that some of these drugs do not necessarily (directly) ‘enhance muscle’. For example, EPO is used to stimulate the number of red bloods cells, which then leads to an increase in the oxygen carrying capacity of the blood and ultimately delivers more oxygen to the muscles. The extra oxygen significantly increases the muscles’ energy production and can therefore help to improve an individual’s performance output ability: meaning higher intensity for a longer duration. So, while EPO does not lead to a ‘growth in muscles’, it does have the potential to increase someone’s ‘muscle energy’, and for this reason is added to the ‘muscle drug’ category.", "score": 0.0011425080882415237, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:8295dd94-5c3d-4278-bdff-c44b3cb25d81>", "text": "Finally, drugs to alter an individual’s mood, for example, someone using selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRI) (anti-depressant) to increase energy levels and to improve positive feelings of well-being. However, the latter seems to be used more often for therapeutic reasons rather than for ‘enhancement’ (e.g., the use of SSRIs when someone is clinically depressed). Therefore, it may be questioned if this is a true form of enhancing (normal) abilities, or rather involves the use of drugs to return to a ‘healthy’ or ‘normal’ mental health.\nIn addition to their categorical differences, the HEDs listed above may be used for various enhancement purposes and are not necessarily used for one type of enhancement. Indeed, what makes these drugs so complex is that HEDs may be used by (1) different people and for different purposes, (2) the same people, at different times, for different purposes, and (3) the same people, at the same time, for multiple purposes. For instance, Melanotan II is used for its tanning effects but is sometimes also used for its sexual properties. Similarly, HGH is used for both its muscle enhancing effects as its weight-loss properties.\nThat said, one specific area of interest within the spectrum of HEDs are drugs that are more frequently associated with professional, amateur and recreational sport: the muscle enhancers, weight-loss drugs and image enhancing drugs. These three categories are commonly referred to as performance and image enhancing drugs (PIEDs). The use of the term PIEDs has evolved over the last couple of decades. Originally, the term ‘performance enhancing drugs’ (PEDs) was used to describe a wide variety of substances used by athletes in an effort to enhance their performance. The term ‘PEDs’ is still widely adopted and tends to refer to an elite sport context but has also been applied when there is no direct link to competitive sports. Yet, in general the word PEDs falls more in line with ‘doping’; a term that is specifically reserved for (elite) sport. In recent years, however, it has become clear that other groups, aside from athletes, are increasingly using these types of substances (muscle enhancers, weight-loss drugs and image enhancing drugs).", "score": 0.0005982694287106478, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:93bd4bd2-2600-4839-a7dc-252dcf7aa355>", "text": "Dutch Folk Painting\nhas gained international recognition as a master of the Dutch Hindeloopen\nstyle of folk painting.\nHer “canvases” are typically accessories, furniture, and walls.

It is capable of transmitting the feeling of not knowing very well what to do with your life at that age and give different alternatives to what is usually knowns as the problems of youth.\nIn summary, “Young and Beautiful” seems like the typical film for film critics, but it can be enjoyed without any problem.

In the House threatens to cave in under its own conceit, but Ozon manages to keep the plates spinning, and the film is easily among his finest works.\nOzon returned to more provocative material with the glacial Young & Beautiful (2013), exploring a teenage girl’s sexual awakening through her work as a call girl. Like a less dreamy Belle du Jour, it’s a typically French character study which is both explicit, yet oddly impersonal, perhaps partly down to the blank performance by lead actress Marine Vacth.\nPerhaps Ozon’s bravest film, The New Girlfriend deals with grief through a blurring of gender roles as a widower takes to wearing his dead wife’s clothes. Gradually he adopts a female persona that engages the erotic curiosity of his wife’s best friend. It feels like Ozon occasionally conflates trans issues with traditional drag, but for the most part skips nimbly through this tricky minefield.\nFrantz (2016) is arguably his most outwardly conventional work.

The pickleball paddle is smaller than a tennis racquet but larger than a ping pong paddle.\nA standard pickleball court is smaller than a tennis court. A pickleball court measures 20x44 feet, which is about a quarter of the size of a tennis court. This smaller size makes the game less physically demanding.\nWhat truly sets pickleball apart from tennis are its unique rules around serving and scoring, as well as the 'non-volley zone', or 'kitchen', which is a seven-foot zone on both sides of the net where volleying is prohibited. These unique aspects add a distinctive flavor to the sport, making it an exciting alternative to traditional racket sports.\nIn tennis, players most commonly use an overhand serve and do not typically let the ball bounce on a serve attempt. Unlike tennis, in pickleball, the serve must be underhand and the ball needs to bounce once on each side before volleys (hitting the ball before it bounces) are allowed.\nWhile pickleball and tennis both require the server to score, the counting system is different. Tennis uses a unique scoring system (love, 15, 30, 40, game), whereas pickleball uses standard numerical scoring (1,2,3, etc).\nThe net in pickleball is lower than in tennis. A pickleball net is set at 34 inches at the center, whereas a tennis net is 36 inches at the center and 42 inches at the posts.\nWhy do they call the game Pickleball?\nThe origins of the name 'pickleball' are often a subject of debate. One popular theory relates the story of the game's inventors, who had a dog named Pickles. Allegedly, Pickles enjoyed chasing the wiffle balls during the game, thus leading to the name 'pickleball.'\nHowever, one of the game's co-founders, Barney McCallum, refuted this theory, stating that the sport was named after the term 'pickle boat,' which refers to the last boat to return with its catch in fishing parlance.", "score": 0.830759287, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:580be44d-4a2b-4ba7-bb49-a3c786b6b6fc>", "text": "Pickleball requires players to serve underhand, it has the unique \"kitchen rule\" with its unique volley zone.", "score": 0.829146266, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:f18d2a97-3e68-4e06-b554-214277aa2325>", "text": "Certainly, there are reasons to change your grip when the situation calls for it but we highly recommend being able hit every shot using the “Continental” grip as a baseline and sparingly add alternate grips from there.

These scenarios may come up once or twice in a game or not at all over the course of many games.

This predominantly stems from the smaller court size, lighter paddles, and slower-moving ball, which collectively make pickleball more accessible and less physically demanding. Despite these differences, pickleball can still offer a significant physical workout and requires a strategic approach to succeed.\nMoreover, the social and community aspect of pickleball creates a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere, which can make the game feel easier and more enjoyable to many. Nonetheless, like any sport, the level of difficulty in pickleball can vary greatly depending on the skill and fitness level of the players involved.\nWhat is the main strategy difference between pickleball and tennis?\nThe fundamental strategy difference between pickleball and tennis lies in their respective playing styles and game tactics. In tennis, power and speed are essential, with players often aiming to hit the ball with high velocity and precision, either to keep their opponent at the back of the court or to make them run along the baseline. On the other hand, pickleball favors placement over power.\nThe primary strategy in pickleball is to keep the ball low and force opponents to lift it, creating opportunities for tactical shots. The existence of the non-volley zone, or 'kitchen', also adds a unique strategic element to pickleball not found in tennis, requiring players to exhibit finesse and control when playing shots from this area.\nWhy is pickleball so noisy?\nPickleball's notorious reputation for being a noisy sport is primarily due to the materials and design of the game's equipment. The game is played with solid paddles usually made of wood, composite, or graphite, and a perforated plastic ball—similar to a wiffle ball. When struck with the paddle, the ball produces a distinct, loud \"popping\" sound that can be quite disruptive, especially in a confined space or quiet neighborhood.\nAdditionally, the nature of the game—which involves frequent, high-speed exchanges—exacerbates the noise level. Measures such as using quieter paddles or balls, implementing noise barriers, and setting suitable hours of play can be taken to mitigate the noise associated with the game.\nWhy is the pickleball serve underhanded?", "score": 0.827195704, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:78518526-c3ce-4f1b-aec6-02ad7ca8a5db>", "text": "Grips are different ways of holding the racket. You need to get comfortable using a wide range of grips, because badminton has so many different shots and rally situations.\nOne grip is not enough\nIn practice, many players use only one grip all the time. This is very limiting because it forces you to bend your body and arm around the shuttle position.\nInstead it’s much better to change the grip in your fingers, so that you can get the strings pointing the right way, but also maintain good hitting mechanics.\nKeep it in perspective\nIn the following videos, I will show you several different grips. It’s important to understand that these are only reference points — so that when I’m teaching you a shot, I can say something like\nuse a thumb grip, and you’ll know what I mean.\nTry not to think of these grips as a fixed position that you must copy exactly. Skilful players are flexible with their grip, and are constantly adjusting how they hold the racket, to suit the rally situation.\nThe shuttle can be in all sorts of different positions, relative to you. This is one reason that you need a flexible grip. We’ll talk about this more when we look at grip range.\nAdjusting your grip can also help you hit different shots.

Stand in a forward stride position behind the baseline with your left shoulder pointing toward the target and your weight on your back foot. The ball is in your left hand, and that arm is extended toward the net. Bend at the waist, take your paddle arm back, drop or toss the ball between you and the target (figure 4.3a), swing your paddle arm forward in an underhand motion, and contact the ball below your waist (4.3b). After ball contact, follow through by bringing your arm up and toward the target (4.3c).\nThe forehand drive serve: (a) preparation, (b) contact, and (c) follow-through.\nAnother serve option is a short crosscourt one that lands just beyond the non-volley line. After a series of deep serves, the opponent will likely not expect a short crosscourt serve, which may lead to an easy point.\nA third option of serving and perhaps the easiest to execute is the lob serve. When executing a lob serve, stand in a balanced upright position with your body facing the net and your left foot slightly ahead of the right foot. The paddle arm hangs loosely at your side with the paddle in a backward cocked position. Hold the ball in your left hand with that arm in line with the target (figure 4.4a). Drop the ball, swing the paddle arm forward, and make contact with the face of the paddle behind and below the ball (4.4b). Follow through up and toward the target (4.4c). The ball should be lofted and land deep in the intended service court. A lob serve is an excellent serve to mix in with a forehand drive serve. The slow speed of the ball as well as the high bounce often throw off the timing of the receiving player.\nThe lob serve: (a) preparation, (b) contact, and (c) follow-through.\nSo off of the forehand are three possible choices of serve: a hard-driven serve, a shallow crosscourt serve, and a lofted lob serve. Your decision about which serve to use depends on the position of the player receiving the serve and also how that player tends to react to and handle each kind of serve.", "score": 0.827007711, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:580be44d-4a2b-4ba7-bb49-a3c786b6b6fc>", "text": "The serve in pickleball is executed underhand to keep the gameplay fair and balanced. An underhand serve prevents the server from gaining an overly aggressive advantage at the start of the point, as it is harder to generate speed or spin compared to overhand serves used in tennis or volleyball.\nThis results in a serve that is easier for the receiver to return, promoting longer rallies and a more strategic, rather than power-driven, game. The specific rules of pickleball also dictate that the paddle must be moving in an upward motion when contacting the ball and the serve must be hit from below the waist, further enforcing this underhand serve technique.\nDo you really exercise when playing pickleball?\nYes, indeed, pickleball provides a fantastic workout. The game involves a lot of movement, including running, lunging, and swift direction changes, all of which contribute to cardiovascular fitness. It helps to improve agility, balance and hand-eye coordination due to the quick volleys and strategic ball placements.\nAdditionally, the game can be quite intense when played at a higher level, increasing calorie burn. However, the lower impact nature of pickleball compared to sports like tennis or basketball, makes it more accessible for people of all ages or those with joint issues, while still providing a good dose of exercise.\nPickleball is a dynamic and rapidly growing sport that offers numerous benefits. It combines the strategic gameplay of traditional racket sports with an approachable underhand serve technique, making it an inclusive and accessible game for all ages and skill levels.\nWhile providing a substantial workout, pickleball also fosters a sense of community, as it encourages players of different generations to come together and enjoy the sport. Its growth trajectory signals a promising future, where pickleball will continue to engage more enthusiasts and cement its position in the realm of popular sports.\nKey differences: pickleball requires less court space, making it a more feasible option for city dwellers and those with limited recreational space. It also requires less physical strength and stamina, making it a perfect choice for beginners, elderly players, or those recovering from injuries who are looking for a lower impact sport. Yet, it doesn't compromise on the fun and competitive spirit, making gameplay exciting and engaging.\nAdditional major differences between tennis and Pickleball: Pickleball requires a paddle and a perforated ball - is also less expensive and more durable than tennis rackets and balls, further lowering the barriers to entry.", "score": 0.825837135, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:0078e438-f485-4cf7-bb16-9f6ecb807260>", "text": "Play pickleball in Menlo Park at Kelly Park\nPickleball is a paddleball sport that combines elements of badminton, table tennis, and tennis.

It refers to the ability to manipulate the ball with precision, accuracy, and consistency. Whether you’re a beginner or an advanced player, mastering the basic ball control techniques is essential for improving your overall game. In this section, we will explore the fundamental aspects of ball control, including grip and stance, footwork and body positioning, relaxation, and mastering basic strokes.\nGrip and Stance\nThe grip is the foundation of your ball control. There are two primary grips used in table tennis: the shakehand grip and the penhold grip. The shakehand grip is the most popular grip and involves holding the racket handle with the thumb and index finger forming a “C” shape, while the other three fingers rest on the backside of the racket. The penhold grip, on the other hand, is less common and involves gripping the handle with the thumb and index finger on one side and the remaining fingers on the opposite side.\nStance plays a crucial role in maintaining balance and generating power in your shots. It’s important to have a stable and balanced stance.", "score": 0.824524164, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:eb08e2c8-4633-431d-a8d5-837cfff6f090>", "text": "Both pickleball and paddle tennis have their merits, but while they use similar equipment, they’re not exactly alike. Though folks often confuse the two, the pickleball vs. paddle tennis matchup has some distinct differences.\nThis article will cover what pickleball and paddle tennis are, including their main differences and similarities.\nWhat is Pickleball?\nThe best way to describe pickleball is like playing ping pong but not on a table, and a slightly bigger ball and paddle. Players hit the ball over the net, where the winner must have 11 points or over.\nIt’s wooden, yet smooth paddles bounce a plastic ball with holes on a badminton-type court. Doubles or singles are options with the same court size and rules, with four players max. You can play pickleball indoor or outdoor.\nPickleball has gained popularity in the last decade because it’s easier than tennis, where beginners, kids, and older adults can enjoy the sport.\nWhat is Paddle Tennis?\nSometimes called pop tennis, paddle ball, padel tennis, or just plain padel – paddle tennis uses a rubber ball to hit over a net with a rough-surface paddle, a large court, and screenings all around the enclosure.\nAlso can be played in doubles or singles with four players max. The scoring is most similar to tennis and the winning set.\nBecause the ball is a bouncier material, paddle tennis may not be for everyone, requiring more athleticism and technique. However, it’s more fast-paced and fewer rules, making it a fun yet challenging racket-sport.\nOriginally, paddle tennis was a sport played mostly during the winter but is now a year-round sport. It’s mostly played outdoors as well.\nDifferences: Pickleball vs. Paddle Tennis\nThe main differences between pickleball and paddle tennis are:\n- The Ball: Pickleball uses a ball similar to a Wiffle ball, which is plastic with holes. Paddle Tennis uses pressurized tennis balls made of rubber.\n- Scoring: In pickleball, the winner must reach 11 points and have 2 more points than their opponent, resulting in a player possibly having more than 11 points at the end. Paddle Tennis is similar to tennis, with 6 point opportunities, scored at 15, 30, 40.\n- Court Measurement: Pickleball courts are similar to badminton, measuring 20 x 44.", "score": 0.822530866, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:5e5556d8-03fd-44ab-b947-23fcb93787d0>", "text": "In summary, with some advanced serving strategies like varying serves, targetting weaknesses, adjusting pace, adding spins, and changing angles, you can take your pickleball game to the next level.

And if you want to serve like a pro, you’ll need to focus on a few crucial factors: your grip, swing, and body position.\nFirst, you need to make sure you have a comfortable grip on the paddle. Use an Eastern grip to set up your hand on the handle of the paddle. It will allow you to perform different types of serves effortlessly, like a forehand or backhand serve.\nNext, focus on your swing. You should work on swinging straight and smoothly. practice hitting the ball at the contact point using a full arm swing and follow-thru. Remember, the speed of your swing must slowly begin, increase in speed at the contact point, and return to a slow speed.\nFinally, make sure your body position is right. Stand with your toes facing the net, and keep your feet shoulder-width apart. With your knees slightly bent, lean forward, tuck your non-dominant arm close to your body, and position your paddle near your belly button.\nBy focusing on these elements, you’ll be able to perfect your serve and win the game like a pro!\nQuestions People Also Ask:\nQuestion 1: Where do you serve the ball in pickleball?\nAnswer: In pickleball, the serve is always made from behind the baseline and in a diagonal direction to the opponent’s service court. The ball must bounce once before your opponent hits it, and it must be served within the service area.\nQuestion 2: What is the service area in pickleball and how big is it?\nAnswer: The service area is the space where the server must stand while serving the ball. In pickleball, the service area is 20 feet wide and stretches from the non-volley zone to the baseline.\nQuestion 3: Can you serve anywhere in the service area in pickleball?\nAnswer: No, you can only serve in the right-hand service court when you are starting the first serve.", "score": 0.821644723, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:81d9c4f9-8bba-4018-8c0e-a0d1673cfecf>", "text": "Therefore, the means that are utilized for obtaining a slip-free grip should not destroy the natural \"feel\" nor the comfort that a player desires in athletic apparatus.\nAnother desirable consideration is that the grip of the handle of the apparatus be designed in a way that gives flexibility of styling, especially in color, for the handle of the apparatus.\n2. Prior Art\nMany different approaches have been tried in the past to accomplish one or more of the desired ends previously mentioned with only varying degrees of success. In most cases, if one sought goal is secured with a reasonable degree of success, it has been done without accomplishing other ends or at the sacrifice of other desirable characteristics in the handle grip.\nIn U.S. Pat. No. 3,845,954 to Case, there is disclosed a non-slip covering for the handle of a tennis racket comprising a strip of adhering tape spirally wound onto the handle and a covering layer of a spirally wound strip of textile material. One extremity of the textile strip is anchored to the handle by means of a screw that enters the handle, the other extremity being anchored by means of an elastic lanyard having a hook that engages a hole in the strip. Consequently, the Case hand grip is not only difficult to apply to a handle, but requires anchoring means that may injure the user's hand, and is not adaptable to handles that cannot accept a wood screw.\nU.S. Pat. No. 3,614,100 to Spitz concerns a removable sleeve for a racquet handle comprising an inner elastic tube covered by an outer tube of terrycloth. Such construction appears to permit puckering and slipping under the stress of torsional forces and is likely to alter the \"feel\" of the handle.\nU.S. Pat. No. 4,133,529 to Gambino discloses a grip that fits around a golf club handle comprising a terrycloth sleeve closed at one end and having an adhesive collar at the other end. The Gambino grip appears to require customized fitting to particular handles, and lacks stability under torsional stress without use of a rubberized inner liner.\nU.S. Pat.

However, even the best racquetball players struggle from time to time trying to grip their racquet. It is important to have the most help possible in tricky situations to pull off that spectacular shot or finish the rally. A racquet slipping out of your hands isn’t just embarrassing, it can also be devastating to your chances of winning a pivotal point. Most good rackets come with factory grips, but these grips wear down over time. The more often you play & the more intensely you play determines how long your racquetball racket lasts.\nYou can significantly improve your performance by choosing a good grip for your personal use. Racquetball grips can be categorized into two distinct categories based on their equipment style. Slip-ons are made of a single piece of rubber that can be slipped on to the handle. Wraps are wrapped around the handle in single or multiple layers and are usually made of synthetic leather. Since slip-ons usually come in different textures and thicknesses because they are single layered while wraps can be layered as much as you want. It is suggested that wraps be used by players that don’t use gloves since the rubber of the slip-ons may slip after your hands get sweaty.\nGrips are usually very inexpensive compared to some of the other racquetball equipment or accessories.\nBuying a grip is always a good investment, and here are some of my recommendations.\nMost racquetball racquets will come pre-strung with a set of strings. However, it is a good idea to always keep a set of spares at hand since you never know when your strings might get worn out & break. Besides, high quality strings can be put on basic racquets for significant performance enhancement. The better your string compatibility with your racquet, the sweeter your shots will feel with the smashing sound on each impact. Good racquet strings will go a long way in winning you more matches.", "score": 0.26605588818429443, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:97242f95-a9ff-4be3-b2fb-f5d620dc29b8>", "text": "Racquetball footwork drills\nRacquetball is a fast-paced sport that is full of split-second strategic decisions. The ball can come at you from several different angles and directions throughout a rally. To best prepare yourself to handle any shot from any direction, the best thing you can do is run footwork drills.\nWhether you run drills as part of your pre-match warm-up or take the time to specifically practice your footwork, taking the time to focus on your feet will help take your game to the next level.\nWhy is Footwork Important?\nFootwork is important in any racquet sport. In the same way that a boxer generates power for a punch from their legs, or a pitcher uses their wind-up to generate rotational power to throw a fastball, a racquetball player can use their legs to create more powerful shots.\nGood footwork also helps you cover significant ground on the court while maintaining control. If you’re turning every which way to run as fast as you can to catch up to a shot, you will not win many points.\nIt’s for these reasons that tennis players run drills to improve tennis footwork. And just as footwork tennis coaching can improve a tennis player’s game, many of the same techniques can be applied to racquetball.\nFootwork drills: tennis vs racquetball\nThe primary difference between the racquetball footwork drills and tennis drills can be found in the amount of distance covered laterally. Tennis courts are wider than enclosed racquetball courts and don’t have balls coming in off a back wall or even off a ceiling.\nSo when running racquetball footwork drills, it’s essential to focus on tracking the ball and keeping your body in position to make effective shots no matter where the ball is coming from.\nWhat Does a Good Shot Look Like?\nWhen you watch people play racquetball, you can tell the difference between good and bad shots pretty easily. You know a good shot when you see it. But making a good shot is a different matter.\nTo get the best accuracy and power behind your shot, you need to make sure your feet are working in conjunction with your arms. To do that, you need to recognize the timing of your swing and how you move into it.\nIt’s fairly common for beginners to sprint to the ball before they hit it.

It’s a good starting point for racquetball for beginners who want an easy introduction to the sport of racquetball. This is why I’ve included it on the racquetball equipment list.\nTake a look at our recommendations for the best racquetball set:\nRacquetball is a high intensity sport that requires plenty of quick & sudden movements. And due to the shiny court surfaces the game is played on, a lot of grip is required due to directional movement. Forward to lateral movement switching should be somewhat easier when your shoes give you good support and traction. This is why racquetball shoes are an essential item on the racquetball equipment list.\nRacquetball shoes are ultra-lightweight and thus provide little extra weight while moving. These shoes also provide support to the ankles and are padded for micro corrections during movement. The gum soles also offer great grip on to the court and thus are different to normal sports shoes. However, racquetball shoes might not be readily available. In those cases, basketball and volleyball shoes make for great replacements due to the similar surfaces these games are played on. But running shoes should always be avoided since they provide zero to no grip or ankle support to provide excess agility.\nBest racquetball shoes\nThe right pair of indoor shoes can help you play your best game, so don’t forget to change out your racquetball shoes after 45-60 hours of play or when they become visibly worn, whichever comes first! There is also the extra cushioning in front of these shoes that degrade with time. So it is always a good idea to switch out your shoes for a fresh pair as they get older. Having a spare never hurts either!\nSizing for racquetball shoes are similar to any other traditional shoe, and most famous brands like Nike, Adidas and Asics also have their own lines of racquetball shoes for those looking to go for established names.

Some prefer a style which is more tactical and light footed whereas others have a more power heavy form of play. If you prefer to play in a tactical manner, lighter racquets will suit your style more while heavy racquets will give you more power when swinging. Each player has a different swing style and swing speed which will heavily influence what type of racquets you will perform best with. Heavier racquets facilitate hitting the ball with greater pace while lighter racquets help with longer rallies. If you add in aesthetic preferences and the sheer feel of each racquet, the sample size gets even harder to narrow down.\nRacquetball racquets come at vastly different price points and your options and preferences will significantly change with budget. The racquetball racquet you choose to play with should have the best balance and aerodynamics within your price range. All racquet materials are generally considered safe. Most modern rackets that are used today are composed of composite carbon fiber (Modern carbon fiber is graphite reinforced plastic). Carbon fiber may be augmented by a variety of materials.\nOur racquetball racquet recommendations\nCompared to the past, modern racquets have excellent strength to weight ratio, are relatively stiff, and give excellent kinetic energy transfer. Lower priced racquets start at about the $20 price point and can cost upwards of $200. This means you do not need to spend a fortune on your first racquet, just find the best racquet at the price point that you’re comfortable with.\nHere are a few recommendations you can pick from:\nThe word ball is part of the name of the sport for a reason.

The International Racquetball Federation mandates the wearing of goggles at all times on a court which is why it’s an important item on the racquetball equipment list. The reason why the federation has made it mandatory to wear racquetball protective eyewear is because of the obvious potential injury issue of a 100 mph ball heading towards you.\nGoggles are a relatively simple and cheap piece of equipment to pick up so there is no excuse not to do so. There are usually two types of lens goggles in the market- one lens piece or two lens piece. Two lens piece goggles usually have extra support in the middle. These lenses look extremely stylish but often provide very little protection. They also block some of the peripheral vision. Single lens piece goggles are significantly less stylish and may be a bit harder to wear but they offer better vision and provide better security.\nImportant racquetball goggles features\nAnti-fog coating is also an important factor to consider. A lot of goggles will fog up during long playing sessions. This obviously leads to problems like loss of vision and sometimes even nausea. Also check if the new pair of goggles you’re buying come with straps because they might fall off during the heat of play. Adjustable side arms are also necessary, since goggles aren’t usually one size serves all. You’d want to be able to adjust your size on the go. Also, you may want to consider getting a pair that allows you to swap lenses easily.\nOnce you have had yours for a while, the lenses may naturally get scratched through wear and tear. Racquetball lenses usually come considerably cheap. Prices range from 10 to 30 dollars varying and depending on range and model. These goggles are specifically designed for racquetball, and thus can avoid damage in most conditions, ensuring durability and bang for your buck.\nHere are some of my recommendations within any range:\nRacquetball gloves help even-out the surface of your hands to help promote a more secure grip on the racquet handle.", "score": 0.00145485958770114, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:fbf0cb01-3498-4254-9e34-a345f63b18ac>", "text": "The training aid of claim 5 wherein said wrist pad is provided with at least two bands; said second strap segment is provided with at least one cinch ring fixed to said second strap segment, said second strap segment is provided with a strap extension extending beyond said cinch ring and connected to said wrist pad by said wrist strap bands and said first strap segment is adapted to pass through at least one of said wrist pad bands and said cinch ring and fasten to itself.\n7.

Only after the proper grip is explained to the student and mastered can instructions regarding stroke techniques, forehands, backhands and strategy be properly carried out.\nProper grip is absolutely essential for the execution of proper forehand strokes and backhand strokes in tennis. An improper grip will make proper stroking impossible and also causes the player to tire much more rapidly, interfering with his enjoyment of the sport.\nIn the past, instruction in proper grip has always started with a very careful illustration of the proper method of wrapping the hand about the racket grip based on a general formula with the heel of the hand. This normally results in the proper grip being applied. Many times the student will unconsciously shift his hand in preparation for a stroke or during a stroke thereby losing the proper grip. This results in quick tiring of the hand and forearm. Also, the racket is held at an incorrect angle for proper stroking. Instructors have tried to remedy this situation by inspecting the grip after stroking and in emphasizing the importance of proper grip.\nSome implements have been designed in the past to aid in maintaining the proper grip during actual stroking.

It serves no other function. Orlistat is the name of the active ingredient, not the name of the brand, and each capsule provides 120mg. It assists the weight loss process by blocking the action of the enzymes the body uses to break down and digest fat. It is very efficient at doing this and can block around 30% of ingested fat.\nFat is a high calorie nutrient. Each gram provides 9 calories. That’s more than double the amount of calories a gram of protein or carbohydrate contains, so the fat blocking ability of Orlistat can be very effective for lowering the amount of calories the body receives in a day.\nOf course, that 30% of undigested fat has to go somewhere, so it passes through the intestines and exits the body with the stool, and its presence generally makes the stool softer and more greasy than normal.\nWho is Orlistat for?\nDoctors only prescribe Orlistat to patients who are obese and certain criteria must be met before any patient is considered a suitable candidate.\nIn order to be considered for an Orlistat prescription patients must:\n- Be aged 28 or over.\n- Have a Body Mass Index (BMI) that is 30 or higher.\n- Have a medical condition, such as high blood pressure or diabetes, that would benefit from losing weight.\nIf a patient qualifies for an Orlistat prescription the doctor will provide advice on any necessary lifestyle changes (diet, exercise) and closely monitor their patient’s progress. If a patient fails to lose at 5% of their body weight within three months of taking the drug the treatment will be stopped.

Orlistat, also known by its brand name Xenical, is a medication that works by inhibiting the absorption of dietary fats in the body. Multiple clinical studies have shown that Orlistat can lead to modest weight loss when combined with a reduced-calorie diet. In fact, a meta-analysis of several randomized controlled trials found that individuals taking Orlistat experienced on average 2.9 kg more weight loss than those taking a placebo. However, it is important to note that Orlistat is not a magic pill. Its effectiveness varies depending on individual adherence to a healthy diet and exercise regimen.

It is important to understand the potential risks before considering its use. One common side effect of orlistat is gastrointestinal discomfort, including oily or loose stools, increased flatulence, and abdominal pain. These effects are a result of orlistat's mechanism of action, which prevents the absorption of dietary fat. Other concerns include the potential for vitamin deficiencies, as orlistat can also inhibit the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins.

This means more information about how public resources are allocated, spent, and audited. Unfortunately, according to a recent publication by the International Budget Partnership, the MENA region records by far the lowest scores on transparency in the Open Budget Index, and most countries are still classified among those with scantest information about their budgets (only Jordan had a relatively good score of 57 in 2012, while Tunisia, Egypt, Algeria, Yemen are all in the bottom range of 0-20). Even more troublesome, Egypt has seen a significant worsening in its rating from 49 in 2010 to only 13 in 2012.\nYet, many of the demands from the youth who led the Arab revolutions were for increased fiscal transparency. These demands range from disclosure of very simple figures to more complicated issues. Such disclosures would answer many questions that are vibrantly present in the public debate. How much does the debt contracted by previous regimes cost in the budget? Are these levels of debt more or less than the government’s spending on health and education? Are the high levels of public subsidy provided on commodities such as food and fuel appropriate? Do these subsidies reach their intended beneficiaries? How much is the military apparatus spending on its wages, pensions and equipment? How much do loss-making public enterprises cost the budget? Is the government paying its salaries and bills to public and private suppliers on time? And more fundamentally: what is the government’s medium-term vision and objectives for the country?

This section will explore how robust mechanisms for checks and balances in public administration contribute to upholding accountability within political organizations. To illustrate this concept further, let us consider a hypothetical scenario where a high-ranking government official misuses their authority for personal gain.\nIn such a case, effective government oversight plays a pivotal role in uncovering and rectifying potential misconduct. Several key aspects contribute to ensuring accountability:\nIndependent Auditing: An essential component of governmental oversight is independent auditing by external agencies or auditors who assess financial records and operations impartially. These audits provide an objective evaluation of compliance with regulations, highlighting any discrepancies or misuse of funds that may have occurred.\nWhistleblower Protection: A vital safeguard against corruption within politics organizations is the protection afforded to whistleblowers who come forward with information regarding wrongdoing or unethical behavior. By providing legal protections for individuals who expose malpractice, governments encourage transparency and deter potential abuses of power.\nTransparency Measures: Governments can enhance accountability through implementing measures that promote openness and accessibility to information related to public administration processes. This includes making budgets, expenditure reports, and policy decisions publicly available, allowing citizens to scrutinize actions taken by politicians and hold them accountable.\nEffective Disciplinary Actions: In order for government oversight to be truly effective, appropriate disciplinary actions must follow when misconduct is identified. Implementing clear procedures for investigating allegations and imposing sanctions acts as a deterrent against future instances of corruption or abuse of power.\nThese measures collectively form the foundation upon which government oversight operates, contributing substantially towards maintaining accountability in political organizations.\nLooking ahead at our subsequent discussion about the role of media in exposing political corruption, it becomes evident that an informed citizenry relies heavily on accurate reporting to stay abreast of developments in public administration. By shining a light on potential wrongdoing, the media plays an essential role in facilitating transparency and holding political entities accountable for their actions.\nThe role of media in exposing political corruption\nSection H2: Government oversight: Ensuring checks and balances in public administration\nTransitioning from the previous section, where we explored the importance of government oversight in maintaining a system of checks and balances within public administration, we now turn our attention to another critical aspect – the role of media in exposing political corruption.", "score": 0.837892473, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:77f4cc49-80c0-44e8-9aee-2e285c1ea703>", "text": "Do you think it’s possible that much money vanished out of a poor country?\nGeneral: I cannot vouch for the accuracy of $1.5 billion or 15 billion, but I know that millions of dollars have disappeared abroad into offshore tax shelters and investments through front companies and/or third-party names.\n15.

Frankly we are working tirelessly to bring a pure and sustainable democracy in Bangladesh, the rest is Allah’s will. The environment in Bangladesh is not fully conducive to real parliamentary democracy, as it is understood in the West. But at the same time, the demands of the world community and aspirations of our own people, make it imperative that we put our sincerest efforts towards this. I do not know anyone in Bangladesh who thinks that we shouldn't have democracy. So irrespective of one's views and with the passage of time; if we can establish the conditions for the very essence of democracy- which means beginning with the grass roots where there is none today; I think we have done more works towards achieving that goal. What we have to eradicate is the parody of democracy that we have suffered, which was camouflage for the systematic plunder of the country by the corrupted and political elites. We should hold local elections as early as possible. This will plant the seeds and start the process of establishing the democratic foundations for a new Bangladesh.\n16.

By focusing on fostering a culture of ethics within governments, we can mitigate instances of corruption and enhance overall transparency.\nTo illustrate this point, let us consider a hypothetical scenario where an influential public official was found guilty of accepting bribes from private corporations in exchange for favorable policies. This case not only tarnishes the reputation of the individual involved but also erodes public trust in the entire political system. It highlights that addressing ethical concerns is pivotal in upholding government accountability and ensuring fair decision-making processes.\nTo effectively promote ethical behavior among public officials, several strategies can be implemented:\n- Strengthening Codes of Conduct: Governments should establish comprehensive codes of conduct that outline expected standards for all public officials. These codes should include provisions that address conflicts of interest, bribery, and misuse of power.\n- Implementing Whistleblower Protection Mechanisms: Encouraging individuals to report unethical practices without fear of retaliation is vital. Robust whistleblower protection mechanisms can help expose misconduct and hold those responsible accountable.\n- Providing Ethical Training Programs: Governments should invest in training programs that educate public officials about their ethical obligations while performing their duties. Such initiatives can raise awareness about potential pitfalls and provide guidance on making morally sound decisions.\n- Enhancing Transparency Measures: Increasing transparency through measures such as financial disclosures, asset declarations, and open access to information builds trust between citizens and their elected representatives.\nEmphasizing these strategies will contribute to cultivating an environment where integrity prevails over corruption within politics organizations.\nTransitioning smoothly into our subsequent section on “Transparency and accountability: Examining the importance of open governance,” it becomes evident that building upon efforts to promote ethical behavior lays the foundation for a more transparent and accountable government. With the establishment of ethical standards, public officials become better equipped to fulfill their roles in serving the interests of citizens while minimizing corrupt practices.\nTransparency and accountability: Examining the importance of open governance\nEthics in government plays a crucial role in promoting ethical behavior among public officials, ensuring the trust of citizens and upholding democratic values.

By setting high standards of behavior and integrity, political leaders can inspire trust among citizens and create an environment conducive to transparency and honesty. One example that highlights the importance of ethical leadership is the case of Country X, where a prominent politician was found guilty of corruption charges. This incident not only eroded public trust but also showcased the need for strong ethical guidelines in politics.\nTo promote ethical leadership, several measures can be implemented:\nCode of Conduct: Establishing a comprehensive code of conduct for politicians helps set clear expectations regarding their behavior.

Therefore, implementing measures that enhance transparency is crucial in promoting good governance and combating corruption.\nThe Role of Transparency Mechanisms:\nTransparency mechanisms serve as essential tools to hold politicians and public officials accountable for their actions. Here are some key aspects related to strengthening these mechanisms:\n- Accessible Information: Governments should make relevant information easily accessible to the public through online platforms or dedicated portals. This allows citizens to understand decision-making processes and assess the performance of political organizations objectively.\n- Disclosure Requirements: Implementing comprehensive disclosure requirements ensures that politicians and officials provide detailed reports on their financial interests, including assets, investments, and potential conflicts of interest.

Historical Tidbits\n9.3. Bernoulli, Johan (1667-1748)Johann Bernoulli was one of the pioneers in the field of calculus and helped apply the new tool to real problems. His life was one of the most controversial of any mathematician. He was a member of the world's most successful mathematical family, the Bernoullis.\nJohann (also known as Johannes, Jean or John, depending on the translation) Bernoulli was born in Basel, Switzerland, on August 6, 1667. His family had originally been from Antwerp, Belgium, but had fled to avoid persecution by Catholics. After first settling down in Frankfurt, Johann's grandfather moved to Basel in 1622. Johann was the tenth son of a successful merchant and local official.\nOriginally, Johann's father had attempted to make a merchant out of his child but the son failed miserably as an apprentice. In 1683, he was given permission to enter the University of Basel, where his older brother Jacob, who was also a great mathematician, was already a professor. While pursuing a degree in medicine, Johann was tutored in mathematics by his older brother and soon developed a mastery of the new Leibnizian calculus. In 1694, he had committed himself to this new field and received his doctorate on a mathematical paper on muscular movement.\nUnable to get the seat of mathematics at University of Basel because his brother held it, Johann accepted a position at the University of Groningen. In 1705, he returned to Basel after his brother's death to take Jacob's old position at the university. During his life he was awarded many honors including membership at the Academies of Science at Paris, Berlin, St. Petersburg and many others. He died in Basel on January 1, 1748.\nJohann's life was always full of controversy. His first conflict occurred in 1691 on a visit to Paris. There he met France's leading mathematician L'Hospital, who persuaded him to teach him the calculus. For a fee, Bernoulli gladly complied and corresponded afterwards. However, the friendship died suddenly when L'Hospital published a textbook on differential calculus. Everything in the book was from Johann's notes and letters but the Frenchman claimed it as his own original work.", "score": 0.841758609, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:316be747-05b4-40e6-9111-bf2a4cec978e>", "text": "The law of large numbers is a mathematical interpretation of this result. Jacob Bernoulli published five treatises on infinite series between 1682 and 1704. The first two of these contained many results, such as fundamental result that ∑ (1/n) diverges, which Bernoulli believed were new but they had actually been proved by Mengoli 40 years earlier. Bernoulli could not find a closed form for ∑ (1/n2) but he did show that it converged to a finite limit less than 2. Euler was the first to find the sum of this series in 1737. Bernoulli also studied the exponential series which came out of examining compound interest.\nIn May 1690 in a paper published in Acta Eruditorum, Jacob Bernoulli showed that the problem of determining the isochrone is equivalent to solving a first-order nonlinear differential equation. The isochrone, or curve of constant descent, is the curve along which a particle will descend under gravity from any point to the bottom in exactly the same time, no matter what the starting point. It had been studied by Huygens in 1687 and Leibniz in 1689. After finding the differential equation, Bernoulli then solved it by what we now call separation of variables. Jacob Bernoulli's paper of 1690 is important for the history of calculus, since the term integral appears for the first time with its integration meaning. In 1696 Bernoulli solved the equation, now called \"the Bernoulli equation\",\ny' = p(x)y + q(x)yn\nand Hofmann describes this part of his work as:-\n... proof of Bernoulli's careful and critical work on older as well as on contemporary contributions to infinitesimal mathematics and of his perseverance and analytical ability in dealing with special pertinent problems, even those of a mechanical-dynamic nature.\nJacob Bernoulli also discovered a general method to determine evolutes of a curve as the envelope of its circles of curvature. He also investigated caustic curves and in particular he studied these associated curves of the parabola, the logarithmic spiral and epicycloids around 1692.

At that time, Leibniz's paper had not yet made the impact that it would later make so the Bernoulli's interest in it represented a deeper understanding of the ideas involved. As Johann's mathematical abilities began to shine bright, there arose a falling out between the two brothers which would later become an out-and-out rivalry. The MacTutor Biography of Jacob Bernoulli says:\n\"...both made contributions to mathematics of the very greatest importance. Whether the rivalry spurred them on to greater things or whether they might have achieved more had they continued their initial collaboration, it is impossible to say.\"Jacob Bernoulli went on to make a very significant mark on the mathematical world. He wrote on a wide range of topics including the parallels between logic and algebra, probability, infinite series, geometry, and calculus. In his geometry, he offered a method for dividing a triangle into four equals parts with two parallel lines; in probability, he offered a mathematical interpretation of relative frequency; on infinite series, he wrote about ∑ 1/n2 which later became known as the Basel Problem (and would later be solved by Leonhard Euler) and wrote about exponential series that would later lead Euler to his creation of the constant e. In calculus, he wrote about the isochrone (a curve of constant descent that had been studied by Christiaan Huygens and Lebiniz) and showed how its path can be characterized by a first order nonlinear differential equation (this paper is also historically the first time that the term \"integral\" is used in the modern sense).\nJacob's other contributions include his analysis of what is today known as the Bernoulli equation: y'= p(x)y + q(x)yn, a general method for determining the evolutes of a curve, did important work with parabolas, logarithmic spirals, epicycloids, what is today known as the lemniscate of Bernoulli, and the Drawbridge Problem (a problem regarding the keeping of a weight and draw bridge balanced).\nJacob Bernoulli became the chair of mathematics and the University of Basel and held this post until his death in 1705.

His teaching provided his students with the understanding that Geometry was not an isolated science but one that was at the very base to human understanding and that science can best observe the progression of the soul and is the one which best exercises our knowledge since it also provides us an understanding of the certainty and correctness at the same time. Finally, it is considered by the variety of its applications and by the advantage of enforcing the habit of a methodology of reasoning which could be further developed to seek truth in all its avenues and provide guidance for the conduct of our lives.\nAfter being thoroughly introduced to the philosophy of his teacher, Paul Euler sought to teach the elements of mathematics to his son even though he had prepared him towards theological studies. When the young Euler was sent to the University of Basel, he was able to study under Johann Bernoulli. Assiduous in his studies and having a pleasant character he was able to become friends with Daniel and Nicolas Bernoulli, disciples and already rivals of their father. He even managed to gain the friendship of the irascible Johann Bernoulli who was willing to provide him with a private lesson once a week to help illuminate the problems which occurred during his lectures and his studies. The remaining days were put to good purpose by Mr. Euler so as to profit from this unusual prerogative.\nThis excellent teaching method prevented his budding genius from exhausting itself against invincible obstacles or stray from the new insights that he was investigating.", "score": 0.00010224535573164436, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:316be747-05b4-40e6-9111-bf2a4cec978e>", "text": "Click the picture above\nto see three larger pictures\nShow birthplace location\n|Previous||(Alphabetically)||Next||Biographies index |\n|Version for printing|\nJacob Bernoulli's father, Nicolaus Bernoulli (1623-1708) inherited the spice business in Basel that had been set up by his own father, first in Amsterdam and then in Basel. The family, of Belgium origin, were refugees fleeing from persecution by the Spanish rulers of the Netherlands. Philip, the King of Spain, had sent the Duke of Alba to the Netherlands in 1567 with a large army to punish those opposed to Spanish rule, to enforce adherence to Roman Catholicism, and to re-establish Philip's authority. Alba set up the Council of Troubles which was a court that condemned over 12000 people but most, like the Bernoulli family who were of the Protestant faith, fled the country.\nNicolaus Bernoulli was an important citizen of Basel, being a member of the town council and a magistrate. Jacob Bernoulli's mother also came from an important Basel family of bankers and local councillors. Jacob Bernoulli was the brother of Johann Bernoulli and the uncle of Daniel Bernoulli. He was compelled to study philosophy and theology by his parents, which he greatly resented, and he graduated from the University of Basel with a master's degree in philosophy in 1671 and a licentiate in theology in 1676.\nDuring the time that Jacob Bernoulli was taking his university degrees he was studying mathematics and astronomy against the wishes of his parents. It is worth remarking that this was a typical pattern for many of the Bernoulli family who made a study of mathematics despite pressure to make a career in other areas. However Jacob Bernoulli was the first to go down this road so for him it was rather different in that there was no tradition of mathematics in the family before Jacob Bernoulli. Later members of the family must have been much influenced by the tradition of studying mathematics and mathematical physics.\nIn 1676, after taking his theology degree, Bernoulli moved to Geneva where he worked as a tutor. He then travelled to France spending two years studying with the followers of Descartes who were led at this time by Malebranche. In 1681 Bernoulli travelled to the Netherlands where he met many mathematicians including Hudde.", "score": 8.05311747291915e-05, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:0c531c6c-b936-4d14-9f2c-a24a6dbce981>", "text": "In his Treatise on the Animal Economy (1732-3, with a third edition in 1738) he anticipated the discoveries of Lavoisier and Priestley on the nature of oxygen.\n320 ^ There was another edition, published at London in 1747, 8vo.\n321 ^ The author seems to have shot his only bolt in this work.

The relationship with his brother Jacob crumbled. After educating his brother in calculus, Jacob just could not accept his brother as his equal mathematically. After Johann solved a complicated problem before his brother, Jacob referred to him as \"his pupil\" and stated all of Johann achievements could be linked back to his teacher. Johann detested this belittling and the two engaged in public criticism of each other's work. At times, the letters became rather heated as insults seemed just as important as the mathematical problem being discussed. Curiously, however, the two seemed to develop ideas building off the other brother's work and in many cases it is likely the two at least collaborated on several occasions.\nThe family problems did not end there. In 1700, his son Daniel was born. Daniel, who would later become famous in physics for the founding of hydrodynamics, did not have a good relationship with his father. It appears Johann was jealous of his son. In one incident, Daniel was kicked out of the house for winning a prize that both of them had competed for. In an even more horrible, not to mention dishonest, display, Johann wanted credit for a discovery his son had made. In a flagrant case of plagiarism, he stole one of his son's papers, changed the name and date and claimed it as his own. These incidents were only two of many atrocious deeds committed by Johann against his son.\nFinally, Bernoulli also became engaged in the mathematical dispute of his day. Having learned Leibnizian calculus, he began a correspondence with Leibniz himself. In 1713, with the dispute over who invented calculus between Leibniz and Newton in full swing, Bernoulli took the side of his friend. Because of his support, Leibniz's calculus gained preference in continental Europe.\nWhen not engaged in some dispute or another, Johann had many discoveries in the field of calculus. He and his brother Jacob are credited with the beginnings of the calculus of variations, which was inspired over an argument on a geometric figure known as the brachistochrone. The two brothers also discovered many new applications for the new calculus which spread its popularity.", "score": 3.38454125123939e-06, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:2774b1a0-e5b4-4141-b7b8-65aa994a2401>", "text": "MAA Intermountain Section Spring Meeting\nSchedule Registration Lodging Local Information\nInvited Speakers Short Courses Contributed talks Contacts\nMathematics to DIE for: The Battle Between Counting and Matching\nPositive sums count. Alternating sums match. So which is \"easier\" to consider mathematically? From the analysis of infinite series, we know that if a positive sum converges, then its alternating sum must also converge but the converse is not true. From linear algebra, we know that the permanent of an n × n matrix is usually hard to calculate, whereas its alternating sum, the determinant, can be computed efficiently and it has many nice theoretical properties. This talk is one part performance art and three parts combinatorics. The audience will judge a combinatorial competition between the competing techniques. Be prepared to explore a variety of positive and alternating sums involving binomial coefficients, Fibonacci numbers, and other beautiful combinatorial quantities. How are the terms in each sum concretely interpreted? What is being counted? What is being matched? Do alternating sums always give simpler results? You decide.\nFibonacci's Flower Garden\nIt has often been said that the Fibonacci numbers frequently occur in art, architecture, music, magic, and nature. This interactive investigation looks for evidence of this claim in the spiral patterns of plants. Is it synchronicity or divine intervention? Fate or dumb luck? We will explore a simple model to explain the occurrences and wonder whether other number sequences are equally likely to occur. This talk is designed to be appreciated by mathematicians and nonmathematicians alike. So join us in a mathematical adventure through Fibonacci's garden.\nWho Wrote L'Hôpital's Calculus Book?\nThe Marquis de l'Hôpital (1661-1704) was a French nobleman whose name is inextricably linked to the well-known rule for resolving indeterminate forms. Although credit for discovering l'Hôpital's Rule rightfully belongs to Johann Bernoulli (1667-1748), the Marquis deserves a special place in the history of the calculus, because he authored the first differential calculus textbook, Analyse des infiniment petits (1696).\nIn the preface to his book, the Marquis acknowledged \"owing much to the illuminations\" of Johann Bernoulli, but did not get into specifics about Bernoulli's contributions.", "score": 1.4701293250918778e-06, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:f2afc0c6-d289-4a45-8894-fe7779542aa0>", "text": "This is also regarded as the beginning of structural analysis, the mathematical representation and design of building structures.\nEleven years later, in 1687, Sir Isaac Newton published Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, setting out his Laws of Motion, providing for the first time an understanding of the fundamental laws governing structures.\nAlso in the 17th century, Sir Isaac Newton and Gottfried Leibniz both independently developed the Fundamental theorem of calculus, providing one of the most important mathematical tools in engineering.\nFurther advances in the mathematics needed to allow structural engineers to apply the understanding of structures gained through the work of Galileo, Hooke and Newton during the 17th century came in the 18th century when Leonhard Euler pioneered much of the mathematics and many of the methods which allow structural engineers to model and analyse structures. Specifically, he developed the Euler–Bernoulli beam equation with Daniel Bernoulli (1700–1782) circa 1750 - the fundamental theory underlying most structural engineering design.\nDaniel Bernoulli, with Johann (Jean) Bernoulli (1667–1748), is also credited with formulating the theory of virtual work, providing a tool using equilibrium of forces and compatibility of geometry to solve structural problems. In 1717 Jean Bernoulli wrote to Pierre Varignon explaining the principle of virtual work, while in 1726 Daniel Bernoulli wrote of the \"composition of forces\".\nModern developments in structural engineering\nThroughout the late 19th and early 20th centuries, materials science and structural analysis underwent development at a tremendous pace.\nThough elasticity was understood in theory well before the 19th century, it was not until 1821 that Claude-Louis Navier formulated the general theory of elasticity in a mathematically usable form. In his leçons of 1826 he explored a great range of different structural theory, and was the first to highlight that the role of a structural engineer is not to understand the final, failed state of a structure, but to prevent that failure in the first place. In 1826 he also established the elastic modulus as a property of materials independent of the second moment of area, allowing engineers for the first time to both understand structural behaviour and structural materials.\nTowards the end of the 19th century, in 1873, Carlo Alberto Castigliano presented his dissertation \"Intorno ai sistemi elastici\", which contains his theorem for computing displacement as partial derivative of the strain energy.", "score": 1.0977650861682301e-06, "source": "sparse"}]}

When a security event occurs, the security heartbeat enables the antivirus client software to communicate with the firewall, providing real-time updates on the health status of endpoints. This constant communication allows for rapid detection of anomalies, suspicious activities, or malware infections, triggering immediate response actions. Such timely responses help prevent further spread of threats, limit potential data breaches, and minimize the impact on organizational resources.

With this capability, we're not just reacting; we're staying ahead of threats. Immediate detection allows us to perform timely risk assessments, ensuring that our understanding of our security posture is as current as possible. It's about turning intelligence into action without delay, minimizing the window of opportunity for attackers.\nWe've seen how vulnerability scanning, when integrated with real-time threat intelligence, can identify weak spots at the moment they become exploitable. This integration is critical because it provides us with the chance to patch or mitigate vulnerabilities before they're leveraged in an attack. It's not just about being informed; it's about being proactive.\nMoreover, immediate threat detection empowers us to streamline our response processes.

With automated incident response tools you can guarantee that all prescribed steps are taken, and in the same order, ensuring nothing is missed. However, if your organization maintains an informal SOC and has limited resources, you may be facing delays in responding to incidents or threats could be going unnoticed. Using incident response tools can save time which can be directed to more pressing workflows and alerts can be handled by fewer people.\nWith constant change in the industry and an increasing landscape of cyberthreats, security teams have a lot on their plate. It takes longer to separate real threats from the false alarms and the amount of time spent on routine data gathering increases Mean Time to Detection (MTTD) and Mean Time to Respond (MTTR). Using automation incident responses can limit the exposure of false alarms, enabling analysts to pay more attention to critical threats and increase the aggregation of data, putting the relevant details in front of the right people.\nNot having an efficient plan in place can easily cause panic when things go wrong. Automating IR not only allows for the decision-making process to be expedited in the event of an attack, but also ensures that the right decision-makers are clearly outlined which minimizes overlap.

Most systems will allow you to alert on pattern monitoring so you can see if there is any abnormal threats potentially occurring on your network.\nConfiguration management can apply to all three core systems within your infrastructure. Not only are you responsible for monitoring your systems health but you are also monitoring any changes being made on your systems. If someone makes a change to a piece of networking equipment after hours then it a good practice to capture these and alert the team to ensure they are aware of these changes. If you have a change management system then this is highly encouraged to ensure that these types of changes are captured and monitored. Change management systems would require all users who make a change to complete a form and when approved all staff in your team will be notified of the change. These alerts are very valuable to the team to make sure your team is aware of the changes.\nThere should be a little more emphasis placed on monitoring your servers.

It should be used as a reference and definition point, rather than an actual Event Management flowchart. Each activity in this process is described below.\nEvents occur continuously, but not all of them are detected or registered. It is therefore important that everybody involved in designing, developing, managing and supporting IT services and the IT Infrastructure that they run on understands what types of event need to be detected.\nMost CIs are designed to communicate certain information about themselves in one of two ways:\n- A device is interrogated by a management tool, which collects certain targeted data. This is often referred to as polling.\nMany CIs are configured to generate a standard set of events, based on the designer’s experience of what is required to operate the CI, with the ability to generate additional types of event by ‘turning on’ the relevant event generation mechanism. For other CI types, some form of ‘agent’ software will have to be installed in order to initiate the monitoring.

Burd\nFall 2013 | Government Contracts Issue Update\nCybersecurity promptly reemerged as a hot topic for the federal acquisition community shortly after the Government reopened from the shutdown. On October 22, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) released a much-anticipated preliminary “framework” of standards and practices designed to assist critical infrastructure organizations addressing and managing cybersecurity risk. The same day, DOD issued a final rule expanding the Defense Industrial Base (DIB) Voluntary Disclosure Program, finalizing an interim rule issued in May. Both steps reflect further progress in implementing President Obama’s Executive Order (EO) 13636, but questions still remain eight months after the EO as to the ultimate content and structure of the NIST framework and the impact both programs will have on government contractors. Chief among those questions for government contractors is whether, and how, the programs could eventually sprout new minimum requirements for companies doing business with the federal Government. On November 18, DOD moved forward with a final rule imposing new basic security requirements for certain types of technical data and mandatory disclosure obligations for certain cyber incidents and breaches.\nNIST’s Preliminary Cybersecurity Framework. The preliminary framework represents months of collaboration between NIST, Government, and industry stakeholders to identify and characterize cybersecurity best practices. EO 13636 instructed NIST to develop “a prioritized, flexible, repeatable, performance-based and cost-effective approach” to “align policy, business, and technological approaches to address cyber risks.” Over the past six months, NIST has engaged industry participants through a series of national workshops to gather input on existing industry standards, guidance and best practices to achieve outcomes that can assist organizations in managing their cybersecurity risk. The voluntary framework is designed to enhance critical infrastructure organizations’ existing business or cybersecurity risk management processes and cybersecurity programs by identifying potential gaps and filling them with standardized best practices. Comments on the preliminary framework are due in early December, and a final framework is anticipated in February 2014.\nThe framework is intended to complement existing business and cybersecurity operations for organizations with formal existing plans and policies, or to serve as a template for organizations that create new programs.

Here are three advantages of outsourcing your cyber security to a managed security services provider (MSSP) like Secuvant.\n1. Cost & Time Savings\nThe cost of hiring seasoned professionals to tackle the complexity of the threat landscape has become expensive, and most SMBs lack the time and capability for training. Outsourcing your cyber security is a cost-effective solution to managing the cyber risk in your organization. MSSPs offer state-of-the-art technologies, experienced security professionals, and strategic consulting that thoroughly assesses your company’s current situation and manages your security needs, from spam filtering in email to 24/7 monitoring and threat protection.\n2. Specialized Security Expertise\nMany small businesses don’t have the internal IT security staff necessary for preventing cyber attacks. And even if an SMB does have a dedicated position or team of great technical talent, their skills are usually not best used on managing cyber risk. They should be focusing on driving new solutions for the business, not on cyber risk management.", "score": 0.0054702259377605485, "source": "sparse"}]}

The priesthood at Delphi made a point of wearing an Ionic khiton made of white linen. I am told that the priesthood of Athena wore white.

Whether they were used as a ground for brightly colored ornamention on other occasions I cannot say.\nThe richest color was a true, Tyrian purple, so dark that it was almost black except where the light hit it. It was very expensive, and mostly worn by the rich and powerful. It is from this Tyrian, red-purple, that the 'royal purple' of modern times is descended. There was also a 'home purple,' made via less expensive means, but it faded more readily.\nIn some pictures we see women wearing a peplos which they have made by sewing together panels from three different fabrics, each richly ornamented, each totally different.\nIn other words, you probably cannot be too colorful, you probably cannot commit any crimes against Ancient Taste, and you probably cannot go as far as our Cultural Ancestors went.

The advice on the subject is rampant and easily accessible. But, it is an altogether different story when we are actually talking about execution. Embroidery digitizers, especially the new ones, find it hard to wrap their heads around such advice, which is often deemed as an airy-fairy affair.\nThe cause for this negligence is that actual color or gradient mixing takes experience and experimenting, before one finally starts to develop a ‘sense’ of how things are actually working. But, it is not the only reason. Partially, it has to do with the way color blending is taught. Irrespective of your skill level, a basic understanding of color mixing principles is essential.\nWe will break color mixing in commercial machine embroidery digitizing to the basic, and take things from the beginning. So, without further ado, let us plunge into the basics.\nBasics Of Color Blending – Color Wheel\nColor wheel’s importance is paramount for understanding the working principles of color blending. Primary colors are Red, Yellow and Blue. This means that no two or more colors can be mixed together to form these colors. Other colors, secondary and tertiary, as we will see, are formulated by the interaction and mixing of these basic colors.\nAs you can see, between red and yellow, there is orange. It is a secondary color and what this means is that to achieve a perfect orange, it has to be half red and half yellow. Similarly, between yellow and blue, there is green and between blue and red, there is purple.\nBetween all these, there can be multiple nuances of these shades, depending upon the constituent proportions. For instance, consider the red-orange. It is a shade that lies between red and yellow. Inferred from the name, the composite color proportion is tilted towards red. To achieve red-orange, one portion of yellow should be mixed with two portions of the red. Whereas, the inverse is true about compositions if you look at yellow-orange shade.\nThese gradations between primary and secondary colors give rise to innumerable possibilities. Mixing all the three colors will get you brown. The result is same when you mix any of these two secondary colors.

The problem can be seen by examining the evolution of the amnion and allantois (see diagram below). Both of these were necessary for the reptilian egg to survive out of water and so enabled vertebrates to live on the land. Haeckel acknowledged that these were evidence against his law of recapitulation, because they are membranes that could not possibly be present in an adult form. These are present in the embryo of birds and mammals, suggesting that they evolved from a common ancestor that was a reptile. This fits Von Baers theory because these are features in the common ancestral embryo.\nNow that we can ignore the work of Haeckel, but are still aware of the importance of embryology to evolutionary studies, we can loook at a couple of examples that highlight the way that embryology confirms the theory of evolution.\nAnnelids and Molluscs\n\"In both cases the zygote cleaves to give rise to strikingly familiar bastulae, in both of which a group of small micromeres are arranged in a characteristic pattern above a smaller number of larger macromeres; the method of gastrulation is the same in both, as is the formation of the mesoderm and coelomic cavities. The mesoderm affords the most impressive similarity: It is derived entirely from the proliferation of a single cell; precisely the same one in both cases. If this is not convincing, a glance at the larva should clinch the matter. Both animals share a so-called trochophore larva, a little creature with a curved gut, a characteristic girdle of cilia and a number of other diagnostic features.\" \"Biology a functional approach - Fourth Edition\" M B V Roberts Nelson 1986\nThis is a rather technical description of how the embryo of annelids and molluscs form, but in essence it is saying that even though the two groups of animals, annelids (worms) and molluscs (shelled marine creatures, octopi and squid) are very different, the embryos are indistinguishable. This is a powerful piece of evidence that they are related in some way, and the most obvious way is that they are descended from the same ancestor which had an embryo similar to this.", "score": 0.84335947, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:e117f78c-a157-4f2b-83f2-1f0396ed1c6d>", "text": "The section in question was entitled “Embryology” by Darwin in the first edition, but “Development and Embryology” in the sixth, and highlights the importance to evolution of changes to the pattern of an organism’s ontogenetic development.\nDarwin’s (1878, p. 386) view of development and embryology was that, “This is one of the most important subjects in the whole round of natural history.” But his ideas on the significance of these intrinsic aspects of evolutionary theory are scattered through much of the book and form the basis for many of Darwin’s ideas on what generates the variation that is the raw material upon which natural selection operates. Darwin was undoubtedly influenced by ideas that had been around since the early nineteenth century and promulgated by embryologists like von Baer in Germany and Serres in France (see Gould 1977). Darwin (1878, p. 396) encapsulated these ideas by observing that, “Embryology rises greatly in interest, when we look at the embryo as a picture, more or less obscure, of the progenitor, either in its adult or larval state, of all members of the same great class.”\nEvolution was perceived as having proceeded by an increase in complexity and an increase in the extent of ontogenetic change, by terminal addition. This idea was to be encapsulated by a great adherent of Darwin’s concept of natural selection, Ernest Haeckel (1866), who wrote that, “Ontogeny is the brief and rapid recapitulation of phylogeny dependent on the physiological functions of heredity (reproduction) and adaptation (nutrition).” Within the developmental history of a single individual, it was believed, lay the entire evolutionary history of the group. Each animal or plant was perceived as a repository of all that had gone before—an infinite number of evolutionary Russian dolls.\nBut to Darwin, developmental change was not always unidirectional, leading to more complex forms.", "score": 0.839398801, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:5cea631f-c2fc-4504-8cf7-8be19d4d8d77>", "text": "First, fossil embryos are extremely rare,20 so the reformulated law has to rely on embryos of modern organisms that are assumed to resemble ancestral forms. The result is a circular argument: According to Darwin’s theory, fish are our ancestors; human embryos (allegedly) look like fish embryos; therefore, human embryos look like the embryos of our ancestors. Theory first, observation later—just as von Baer had objected.\nSecond, the idea that later evolutionary stages can simply be tacked onto development is biologically unrealistic. A human is not just a fish embryo with some added features. As British embryologist Walter Garstang pointed out in 1922, “a house is not a cottage with an extra story on the top. A house represents a higher grade in the evolution of a residence, but the whole building is altered—foundations, timbers, and roof—even if the bricks are the same.”21\nThird, and most important, vertebrate embryos are not most similar in their earliest stages. In the 1860s, Haeckel made some drawings to show that vertebrate embryos look almost identical in their first stage—but his drawings were faked. Not only had he distorted the embryos by making them appear more similar than they really are, but he had also omitted earlier stages in which the embryos are strikingly different from each other. A human embryo in its earliest stages looks nothing like a fish embryo.\nOnly after vertebrate embryos have progressed halfway through their development do they reach the stage that Darwin and Haeckel treated as the first. Developmental biologists call this different-similar-different pattern the “developmental hourglass.” Vertebrate embryos do not resemble each other in their earliest stages, but they converge somewhat in appearance midway through development before diverging again. If ontogeny were a recapitulation of phylogeny, such a pattern would be more consistent with separate origins than with common ancestry. Modern Darwinists attempt to salvage their theory by assuming that the common ancestry of vertebrates is obscured because early development can evolve easily, but there is no justification for this assumption other than the theory itself.22\nAlthough Haeckel’s drawings were exposed as fakes by his own contemporaries, biology textbooks used them throughout the twentieth century to convince students that humans share a common ancestor with fish.", "score": 0.838227272, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:fe9aae1d-c19a-4806-91a0-65191e40b472>", "text": "Embryology is the study of the development of animals after fertilisation takes place. The embryo needs to pass through three stages, cleavage, where the single fertilised egg divides into many cells, gastrulation, or the formation of the gut which is where the embryo forms different layers and organogeny, the formation of the organs.\nThe study of developmental biology as it pertains to evolution was really begun before \"Origin of Species\" was even written. In 1828, a noted embryologist called Karl Ernst Von Baer had two embryos preserved in alcohol, which he forgot to label. He was rather annoyed to find, when he went to study them, that he could not determine whether they were lizards, birds, or even mammals.\nHe was actually rather disturbed by his findings, considering that evolution hadn't been realised yet. He didn't quite understand why the embryos not only looked identical in early development, but developed according to the same pattern. And we now know that organisms more closely related evolutionarily diverge from each other (in embryonic likeness) at much later points. For example, if you take a fish, a salamander, a tortoise, a chick, a hog, a calf, a rabbit, a monkey, and a human then The fish and salamander will diverge first into recognisable types. The others are all impossible to tell apart at this point. Then the tortoise, then the chick, then the hog and calf, then the rabbit, then the monkey and human at a much later point.\nEmbryology has a bad press amongst Creationists due to the work of one fraud commited in the 19th century by Ernst Haeckel. This is totally unjustified.\nThe difference between Von Baer and Haeckel\nVon Baer noted that the embryos of creatures resemble each other more than the adults do, Haeckel later said that embryo's show the evolutionary pathway of descent by resembling the adult of each creature in its family tree. The difference between these two views can be seen by considering the gill pouches in a human, reptile or bird embryo. Haeckel said that the presence of these gills showed that the embryo was going through a 'fish' stage. Von Baer said that the gill pouches show a relationship between a terrestrial vertebrate embryo and a fish embryo.", "score": 0.837813199, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:5cea631f-c2fc-4504-8cf7-8be19d4d8d77>", "text": "The passage Darwin cited was from a work written in German by von Baer in 1828; Thomas Henry Huxley translated it into English and published it in 1853. Darwin didn’t even realize at first that it was from von Baer: In the first two editions of The Origin of Species he incorrectly attributed the passage to Louis Agassiz.17\nIronically, von Baer was a strong critic of Darwin’s theory, rejecting the idea that all vertebrates share a common ancestor. According to historian of science Timothy Lenoir, von Baer feared that Darwin and his followers had “already accepted the Darwinian evolutionary hypothesis as true before they set to the task of observing embryos.” The myth that von Baer’s work supported Darwin’s theory was due primarily to another German biologist, Ernst Haeckel.”18 Haeckel maintained not only that all vertebrate embryos evolved from a common ancestor, but also that in their development (“ontogeny”) they replay (“recapitulate”) their evolutionary history (“phylogeny”). He called this The Biogenetic Law: Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny.\nIn Why Evolution Is True, Coyne writes that “the ‘recapitulation’ of an evolutionary sequence is seen in the developmental sequence” of various organs. “Each vertebrate undergoes development in a series of stages, and the sequence of those stages happens to follow the evolutionary sequence of its ancestors.” The probable reason for this is that “as one species evolves into another, the descendant inherits the developmental program of its ancestor.” So the descendant tacks changes “onto what is already a robust and basic developmental plan. It is best for things that evolved later to be programmed to develop later in the embryo. This ‘adding new stuff onto old’ principle also explains why the sequence of developmental stages mirrors the evolutionary sequence of organisms. As one group evolves from another, it often adds its developmental program on top of the old one.” Thus “all vertebrates begin development looking like embryonic fish because we all descended from a fishlike ancestor.”19\nNevertheless, Coyne writes, Haeckel’s Biogenetic Law “wasn’t strictly true,” because “embryonic stages don’t look like the adult forms of their ancestors,” as Haeckel (and Darwin) believed, “but like the embryonic forms of their ancestors.” But this reformulation of The Biogenetic Law doesn’t solve the problem.", "score": 0.829490542, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:144f9c8b-edab-4711-afc8-dfbf54e4d29e>", "text": "It was widely supported in the Edinburgh and London schools of higher anatomy around 1830, notably by Robert Edmond Grant, but was opposed by Karl Ernst von Baer's embryology of divergence in which embryonic parallels only applied to early stages where the embryo took a general form, after which more specialised forms diverged from this shared unity in a branching pattern. The anatomist Richard Owen used this to support his idealist concept of species as showing the unrolling of a divine plan from an archetype, and in the 1830s attacked the transmutation of species proposed by Lamarck, Geoffroy and Grant. In the 1850s Owen began to support an evolutionary view that the history of life was the gradual unfolding of a teleological divine plan, in a continuous \"ordained becoming\", with new species appearing by natural birth.\nIn On the Origin of Species (1859), Charles Darwin proposed evolution through natural selection, a theory central to modern biology. Darwin recognised the importance of embryonic development in the understanding of evolution, and the way in which von Baer's branching pattern matched his own idea of descent with modification:\n|“||We can see why characters derived from the embryo should be of equal importance with those derived from the adult, for a natural classification of course includes all ages.||”|\nErnst Haeckel (1866), in his endeavour to produce a synthesis of Darwin's theory with Lamarckism and Naturphilosophie, proposed that \"ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny,\" that is, the development of the embryo of every species (ontogeny) fully repeats the evolutionary development of that species (phylogeny), in Geoffroy's linear model rather than Darwin's idea of branching evolution. Haeckel's concept explained, for example, why humans, and indeed all vertebrates, have gill slits and tails early in embryonic development. His theory has since been discredited. However, it served as a backdrop for a renewed interest in the evolution of development after the modern evolutionary synthesis was established (roughly 1936 to 1947).\nStephen Jay Gould called this approach to explaining evolution as terminal addition; as if every evolutionary advance was added as new stage by reducing the duration of the older stages. The idea was based on observations of neoteny. This was extended by the more general idea of heterochrony (changes in timing of development) as a mechanism for evolutionary change.", "score": 0.827691555, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:6aa5e403-a0db-4c89-a4ba-d92468b121e4>", "text": "The ‘biogenetic law’ made popular by Ernst Haeckel (who was Darwin’s chief apostle in Germany) states that the embryo, as it develops in the womb, goes through various stages of development which show the features of its supposed evolutionary ancestors.\nEven though Haeckel admitted to having fraudulently altered his diagrams to support his theory, many still believe (incorrectly) that the human embryo has gill slits, a tail and a yolk sac, for example. These ideas have long been discredited by embryologists.\nWhat about our hands and feet? Do they show any evidence of a more ‘monkey-like’ condition in the womb? Human hands are unique compared to the rest of the animal kingdom, as are our feet. The combination of an opposable thumb (the thumb being able to touch the tip of any of the other fingers) and our being able to rotate the hand freely (palm up or palm down, shared with primates) gives us an ability to manipulate objects and tools like no other creature alive, even if they felt so inclined.\nDarwin quoted Professor Owen as saying that the big toe, which functions as a bracing point in both standing and walking, is perhaps the most characteristic aspect of the human build. Human feet are most certainly not designed for grasping or climbing trees. Our big toes are used to push off against the ground, to grip the ground, as it were, but generally not to grip objects. Infants can often be lifted by a compression grip between the big toe and the second. Some races of men have this ability in quite marked form, which is used by disabled foot/mouth painters. However, it is nothing like the curling, gripping foot of tree-climbing primates.\nWhat does the development of hands and feet in the human embryo tell us, then? In a six-week-old, 11-millimetre-long embryo, one can already see the regions from which the limbs will develop. Only one week later, the five-fold digitization of the hand is clearly visible, even though the feet are still like paddles. It takes another week for the feet to ‘catch up’ in this regard.\nAt 15 millimetres one already can see the later function of these limbs mirrored in their early movements.

The 24 figures in the drawing at right illustrate three stages in the development of eight vertebrate embryos. As the embryos move from an earlier to a later stage of development, we see a corresponding movement from a startling similarity across the specimens to a recognizable diversity of forms. According to Haeckel’s theory, the “gill slits” (pharyngeal arches) observed in the embryos’ “tailbud stage,” depicted in the top row, suggest the adult form of a common fish-like ancestor, while the curved tail, which develops soon after the gill slits, repeats a reptilian stage in evolution.\nHaeckel’s drawings have since been shown to be oversimplified and in part inaccurate (Richardson 1998; Richardson and Keuck 2001; Gould 2000). For example, embryonic pharyngeal arches are not gills and do not carry out the same function as they do in adult fish. They are the invaginations between the gill pouches or pharyngeal pouches, and they open the pharynx to the external environment. Even Haeckel's contemporaries criticized him for these misrepresentations, which, among other things, included doctoring drawings to make them more alike than they really are, and choosing only those embryos and life stages that came closest to fitting his theory. Stephen Jay Gould (2000) likewise claimed that Haeckel \"exaggerated the similarieties by idealizations and omissions,\" and concluded they were characterized by \"inaccuracies and outright falsification.\"\nSome older editions of textbooks in the United States still erroneously cite recapitulation theory or the Haeckel drawings as evidence in support of evolution without appropriately explaining that they are misleading or outdated.\nHaeckel impact on Social Darwinism\nHaeckel's recapitulationist theory had a strong impact on the English Social Darwinist Herbert Spencer and the maturationist theory of G. Stanley Hall. But he contributed to Social Darwinism as a philosopher in his own right.\nHaeckel extended Darwinism beyond its usefulness as a scientific theory; he extrapolated a new religion or philosophy called monism from evolutionary science.", "score": 0.821412802, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:66aa50ba-3181-483b-a06a-8e6c8ef480fb>", "text": "However, he mistakenly assumed that no one in Berlin had grasped the importance of the Origin, and when he was invited to present Darwin’s theory to the Congress of German Scientists and Physicians in 1863, he used the occasion to argue less for the principle of natural selection than for “the threefold parallel between embryological, systematic, and paleontological development.” This “biogenetic law,” as Haeckel termed his morphological analogy, not only provided “the strongest proof of the truth of evolutionary theory” but also offered science a tool for “reconstructing the history of the lineage” from the sequence of changes apparent in the embryo (Bölsche 1906: 131; Di Gregorio 2005: 86–98; Richards 2008: 100).\nHaeckel’s emphasis on typological order reappeared in two subsequent books, The General Morphology of Organisms (Haeckel 1866), his most important scientific treatise, and The Natural History of Creation (Haeckel 1868), his first popular publication. In contrast to Darwin’s reticence in specifying genealogies of species, Haeckel made so bold as to print stem-trees in both works, vertebrates in the General Morphology and races of men in The Natural History of Creation (Di Gregorio 2005: 195; Richards 2008: 226).\nDu Bois-Reymond regarded Haeckel as having pushed things too far. In an address to the Prussian Academy of Sciences in 1876, he argued that morphological laws were more akin to legal maxims than mathematical derivations—evidence from embryology was disparate and evidence from paleontology was inconclusive (du Bois-Reymond 1912b: 548–550). The clues to the order of species suggested by Darwin’s theory did not support conjectures about the heritage of man. As du Bois-Reymond quipped, Haeckel’s family trees of human origins were worth about as much to naturalists “as the pedigrees of Homeric heroes to historians. If I want to read a work of fiction,” he added, “I can find something better than a ‘History of Creation’” (du Bois-Reymond 1912b: 550; Finkelstein 2013: 250–251).", "score": 0.819575429, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:8311604f-0064-4fb5-ab6d-61edde0f24f0>", "text": "[emphasis added]\nThe answer is, of course: “No.”, thus disposing of the rest of this question and the remaining nine, all of which were premised on this ignorant misconception.\nIDiotic questions thus disposed of, PZ turned to more interesting topics. The physicist Ernest Rutherford claimed that “All science is either physics or stamp-collecting” – this is “full of shit”, indicating Rutherford’s ignorance of biology, but also “kind of right” – there is a form of stamp-collecting science that is just a cataloging of facts, and this is insufficient: explanation of the facts is key, and the history of science must also be appreciated. I for one had not realized that the view expressed in the slogan associated with Haeckel: “Ontogeny recapitulates phylogeny”, has pre-evolutionary roots in the idea, formulated by C.G. Carus in 1835, that the similarity of animal embryos at early stages is due to organisms climbing the “great ladder of life”, from “inferior” (starting with jellyfish) to “superior” (culminating, of course, in humans). The obsolete term for Downs’ Syndrome, “mongolism”, reflects the racist extension of this view to differences among humans.\nCarus’ view was opposed by Karl Ernst von Baer, probably the “greatest embryologist of all time”, although cranky, snobbish and brutal. PZ’s quip: “I’m not as brilliant as von Baer, but I can at least emulate that part!” was appreciatively received. Von Baer was not an evolutionist, and did not become one even after Darwin published the Origin. He gave a very different explanation from the ladder: early embryos express “general characters”. He made a comparison to sculpting: the sculptor first builds a rough outline of the required form, then adds details. This view of development is still valid; Darwin agreed with it in general, but noted that there are also significant early differences, especially in larval characters: we must look deep.\nHaeckel was responsible for a reinvigoration of recapitulation theory, giving an evolutionary interpretation of the “ladder”: development as a process of repeating evolutionary history.", "score": 0.815753639, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:d2a7e597-c12f-4240-b722-1a901b8c2d86>", "text": "The egg cell, or ovum (plural ova), is the female reproductive cell, or gamete, in most anisogamous organisms (organisms that reproduce sexually with a larger, female gamete and a smaller, male one). The term is used when the female gamete is not capable of movement (non-motile). If the male gamete (sperm) is capable of movement, the type of sexual reproduction is also classified as oogamous. A nonmotile female gamete formed in the oogonium of some algae, fungi, oomycetes, or bryophytes is an oosphere. When fertilized the oosphere becomes the oospore.[clarification needed]\nWhile the non-mammalian animal egg was obvious, the doctrine ex ovo omne vivum (\"every living [animal comes from] an egg\"), associated with William Harvey (1578–1657), was a rejection of spontaneous generation and preformationism as well as a bold assumption that mammals also reproduced via eggs. Karl Ernst von Baer discovered the mammalian ovum in 1827. The fusion of spermatozoa with ova (of a starfish) was observed by Oskar Hertwig in 1876.\nIn animals, egg cells are also known as ova (singular ovum, from the Latin word ovum meaning 'egg'). The term ovule in animals is used for the young ovum of an animal. In vertebrates, ova are produced by female gonads (sex glands) called ovaries. A number of ova are present at birth in mammals and mature via oogenesis. In 2012, White et al. disproved the longstanding dogma that all of the ova are produced before birth. The team from the Vincent Center for Reproductive Biology, Massachusetts, Boston showed that oocyte formation takes place in ovaries of reproductive-age women.[clarification needed] This report challenged a fundamental belief, held since the 1950s, that female mammals are born with a finite supply of eggs that is depleted throughout life and exhausted at menopause.\nThe human ova grow from primitive germ cells that are embedded in the substance of the ovaries.

Richards painstakingly documents how Darwin's theorizing, despite modern pronouncements to the contrary, was integrally linked to both evolutionary progress and recapitulation. Species evolution itself was modelled on individual evolution (evolution or unfolding of the embryo), and thus the embryo must recapitulate the adult forms of its ancestors. Darwin's own experiments and the logic of his theorizing necessitates these conclusions.\nRichards then bravely takes on Darwin's modern reinterpreters/hagiographers from Russell to Mayr, Gould, and Bowler.

(Aside from the mechanics that the mario and luigi and paper mario series use?)\nIn my current opinion the key is to have a much wider separation between optimal decisions and suboptimal or terrible decisions and to have these change on a turn-by turn basis. To really make Turn Based Battles more engaging, you need to make it more about the player evaluating the circumstance and needing to judge what options are best for the situation. These need to change turn by turn so that the player rethinks on a continual basis, so they are engaged in the primary challenge.\nHow do you do this? First, options need to have tradeoffs versus other options. If you have a clear sorting order, like a bunch of JRPGs that have Bolt1 Bolt2 Bolt3 or something along those lines, you end up with people using the most powerful option most of the time. There need to be other variables and dimensions to options besides how much HP damage they output in order to make them worthwhile over your most damaging option. In SMT, attacks that hit opponent’s weaknesses also gain turns for you, turns are another dimension of advantage that can ultimately translate into more damage than simply your most damaging option at that moment. (though obviously the problem here is that hitting their weakness usually is your most damaging option, then you gain a turn on top of that, so not the best example).\nUltimately what determines who wins in a turn based RPG is who can output the most damage, so everything comes down to either doing the most damage every turn, or setting up a circumstance in the future where you can output even more damage than you are now, while also balancing these against your survival. So the most basic tradeoff is dealing damage versus healing it, then dealing a lot of damage now versus more later, versus healing. Most traditional stat buffs in JRPGs are basically things that allow you to deal more damage in one way or another. You get direct damage buffs, which increase your damage on later turns, speed buffs which mean you attack faster, dealing damage more frequently, ultimately dealing more damage, accuracy buffs, which mean missing less which is more damage, etc.\nSo the questions to ask are, how can I make an option tempting that isn’t one of these existing options without making that option the only one people want to pick? How can I make people want to pick a different option every turn?", "score": 0.832058191, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:d85f38f4-c7ac-4894-b5dc-f44fec71a3bc>", "text": "Or do you trade 2d6 for the wager each time?\nDo overwhelming penalty dice stack or do you take the highest value like with bonus dice?\nWhy is there no XP (or other kind) of reward when a player withdraws in a Power challenge.

I do not remember if it was in the FAQ or the game rules that i read this but it said that \"this game has absolutely no randomness in it.\" I am playing in NON random battles and my understanding for the winning card in a round is as follows:\n-The card with the higher attack always wins.

I lost this battle playing in NON random.\n-Next is the way a winner is determined when the attack power is equal. I read that winner is the card with the lesser amount of stars will win with. If the stars are the same, then the attacker will win the battle. This problem has occurred to me 3 different times. Twice i have had a card maxed out with 3 stars and 4 stars and my opponent had a card maxed out with 5 stars both times and we both had equal attack power. I lost both of these match ups.

Though the gameplay mechanism is consistent, there are many variations between these websites - occasionally extending even to the rule terminology. As a general reference therefor we would recommend the succinct Dominating12 terminology glossary.\nWhile we try to accommodate for rule variations in the following instructions, please be aware that they are meant specifically for 2-player (1v1) games (optimal gameplay is very different for multiplayer games). We follow the most popular battle mechanism, where the attacker rolls up to 3 and the defender up to 2 dice (with the defender winning ties). Our notation for attack configurations is AvD, with A being the number of attackers (troops on the attacking territory minus one) and D being the number of defenders (total troops on the defending territory).\nIn Risk, single battle outcomes are decided by random events (roll of the dice) best thought of in terms of probability. While as much seems obvious, players should make sure to understand that:\n- Future odds are not influenced by past outcomes - bad/good dice just mean that your position has worsened/improved, and should not affect your future roll expectations.\n- The odds (especially for computer-based versions) are unbiased - you can only become a great player by winning games where your luck was reasonably bad.\nTotal probabilities for taking over a territory - based on the total number of attacking and defending troops - can be determined via a Markov chain (as for instance in this paper) or via a Monte Carlo simulation. That information, however, is mostly irrelevant in a 1v1 game, since you should never auto-attack. With every attack the state of the game changes, and you should always re-evaluate your next move in light of the new state.\nWhilst sounding complicated, this actually makes the mathematics of your gameplay easier, as there are a very limited number of scenarios for every attack (6 scenarios in total - given the aforementioned battle cap of 2 defenders and 3 attackers). Based on that knowledge you can calculate the odds for each scenario and determine when it is advantageous to attack.This article demonstratively calculates the odds for all single-attack configurations and and presents a summary table.\nThe single-battle odds table shows that the optimal attack configurations are those with the maximum number (3) of attacking units.", "score": 0.828088224, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:a44647bc-8b9b-43e2-8ef9-5ea4ff94dd61>", "text": "Experienced players also tend to group Corners by Arrow direction, so they can plan out their moves better.\nPath of Travel:\nThe second dice placed determines the Path of Travel. You are always moving FORWARD at all times, never backwards. Think of the Path of Travel like a car hurdling down a highway. The first dice is where it started, and the second dice shows you the direction on the Road you are heading. The dice after that continues the road. The Road can only continue forward, NEVER back! When you come to Cross piece, you treat it like an overpass. You continue either over or under the perpendicular road, but can NEVER turn Right or Left onto it. Like an Overpass, the Cross piece contains 2 completely separate roads that never touch each other.\nRemember: At NO TIME can you turn around and use the other end of the road! You must continue forward until you, or the other players, run out of usable Road.\nDon't confuse the Path of Travel with the Arrows on the Corners, which exist only to give you can idea of which way each Corner should face.

We can imagine that a sequence of indeterministic dice throws is recorded. Then we have two cases. In one shooting room, the fate of the people that enter is determined directly by the original indeterministic process. In another shooting room, at some later time, the fate of the people that enter this room is determined by the transcripts of the outcome of the indeterministic process. The sequence of dice outcomes is the same in both cases, and we can assume that the people involved know this. Yet, according to Leslie, what you should believe depends on whether you are in the deterministic shooting room or the indeterministic one. Thus, Leslies claims lead to contradicting statements about what amount to the same game; i.e. Leslies doctrine is self-refuting.\nLeslie responds to this briefly in a footnote. He dismisses the objection as question-begging: \"I reject Eckhardts question-begging claim that betting games are the same games regardless of whether the are played (a) with indeterministic dice or else (b) with records\" (Leslie , pp. 435f). While this defense might save Leslie from outright contradiction, it doesnt remove the perceived implausibility of the consequence that he is committed to treating the two games differently.\n[Back to anthropic-principle.com]\nBarrow, J.

While video games have become very popular on personal computers, the popularity has also reached the mainstream and games can be found in many retail outlets. Games are different from work, which traditionally is carried out for profit, and from literature, which is normally more of an expression of philosophical or artistic elements. A game is much more structured and goal-oriented than a work, with the player acting as a protagonist who pursues a specific goal. The player interacts with the computer-generated environment as if he or she were a real person trying to complete a task.\nUnlike literature or theater, in which the experience is controlled by the mind, video games require the physical skill of the player. Board games like Monopoly, Scrabble, Risk, and Chess are all abstract games, in that there are no underlying rules controlling the outcomes. There is nothing stopping a player from achieving a goal, since the rules of the game do not restrict how one can act. However, in this type of game, the player must take into account all the probabilities, since a winning strategy will depend upon the probability that his or her strategy will work.\nOne of the most famous examples of abstract strategy is chess. In the game of chess, players may view the board as a whole, or they may view each of the pieces as separate parts of a greater whole. Players may also choose to view each of the pieces on the board as unique entities, to be moved, traded, or possessed by other players. Though the game of chess is very complicated, it still employs a great number of abstract strategies, such as using hidden information, ambiguous words, and repeating patterns in order to create tactical opportunities.\nMany board games involving dice involve abstract probability. For example, black and white dice, rolled uniformly at regular intervals, are used to represent the probability of any event occurring. The randomness of these dice means that every outcome is unpredictable. Though players may carefully plan their moves in order to maximize the chance of a particular outcome, such planning does not always produce the best results. This is because the unpredictable element of the dice creates random variations in the game itself, which may greatly influence the way in which players react to situations.\nOther abstract board games with dice include bingo, lotto, and the video game Monopoly.", "score": 6.423491585547213e-06, "source": "sparse"}]}

Why was that particular object acquired? Why is it significant? What story does it tell? Museums and art galleries are repositories of what we value or historically valued as a society, and they act as safe houses for those cultural traditions.

The skeletons were part of the enormous collection of bones, skulls and other human remains that are housed in the vaults below the museum. Most people know of the Museum only through its dinosaur skeletons or the blue whale hanging in the mammal room. But the Museum is also a world-renowned research centre, and much of that research - into human evolution, human history and human disease - centres on its collection of human remains. In recent years, however, there has been a growing demand, particularly by indigenous groups, for the return of such remains, a demand that was given legal force by new legislation in 2005.\nOne such demand came from the Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre. Last November, the Museum reluctantly acceded to the claim, even though, as the evolutionary anthropologist Robert Foley put it, 'There is no doubt that if these remains are destroyed, our knowledge of humanity will be diminished.' Scientists had nevertheless hoped to conduct DNA and other non-destructive tests on the bones before they were returned to be cremated, and hence lost forever. The Aboriginal Centre objected, however, to any form of testing on the bones and in January this year took out a court injunction preventing all scientific investigations. The Museum was eventually forced to return the bones without performing any tests upon them.\nThe battle over these 17 Aboriginal skeletons illustrates a growing tension that has developed in recent years between the demands of scientific rationality and the desires of cultural identity. At the heart of the debate is the issue of who owns knowledge. Museums and research institutions across the world house hundreds of thousands of bones, skulls and skeletons, largely collected over the past two hundred years, and often in unsavoury circumstances. In Britain there are around 61,000 remains in some 132 different collections, the largest of which is that of the Natural History Museum. For scientists, ongoing investigation of collections such as the Natural History Museum's is critical for understanding humanity's place in the world. For many within the source communities, however, such collections are tainted by the legacy of racism and colonialism, and scientific investigations of them are regarded as morally reprehensible.", "score": 0.007484100734912344, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:b424d6e6-d9b7-43f7-ba1f-f46c362fba3d>", "text": "Did you know?\nRock art showcased in the National Culural History Museum reflects the accessing of spiritual power by the San people through their trance dance.\nThe National Museum of Cultural History in Pretoria is housed in the Old Mint, a building of historical importance in South Africa's capital city.\nCoins may no longer be produced here but what this building contains is just as valuable, including wide-ranging cultural and natural displays, and prized South African artworks.\nSo diverse are the collections here that any visitor is guaranteed to find an exhibit or two to offer hours of absorbing viewing.\nOne exhibit, titled 'Schroda' after a site in the ancient kingdom of Mapungubwe, displays early Iron Age clay figurines excavated from this World Heritage Site in the province of Limpopo.

Street artist Jamie Paul Scanlon, however, started to create art for a different reason.\nJamie, better known as JPS (previously here and here) on his social media, didn’t have the best childhood, nor luck.

Sometimes multiple layers of stencils are used on the same image to add colours or create the illusion of depth.\nThose who make and apply stencils have many motivations. For some, it is an easy method to produce a political message. Many artists appreciate the publicity that their artwork can receive. And some just want their work to be seen. Since the stencil stays uniform throughout its use, it is easier for an artist to quickly replicate what could be a complicated piece at a very quick rate, when compared to other conventional tagging methods.\nStencil graffiti began in the 1960s. John Fekner was one of the first stencil artists to place his work outdoors, starting in 1968. Fekner's stencil Wheels Over Indian Trails greeted motorists and international travelers arriving in New York City at the Pulaski Bridge Queens Midtown Tunnel from 1979-1990. The message remained untouched for 11 years, until Earth Day 1990, when Mr. Fekner, feeling the piece had run its course, painted over it.\nBlek le Rat's first spray painted stencils were seen in Paris in 1981. He was influenced by the graffiti artists of New York City but wanted to create something of his own.\nAustralian photographer Rennie Ellis documented some of the earliest examples of stencil art to appear in Sydney and Melbourne in his 1985 book The All New Australian Graffiti. In the introduction to the book, Ellis noted that US photographer Charles Gatewood had written to him and sent him photographs of similar stencil graffiti that had recently appeared in New York City, leading Ellis to speculate that:\n- \"... unlike our subway-style graffiti, which is nothing more than a copy of a well-established New York tradition, the symbols of Australia and America had originated separately and unknown to each other.\"\nOver the years this form of graffiti has become a worldwide subculture.

I’m guessing this works pretty well for trips into town from farms in the hinterlands.\nIf you want to get from town to town, though, the old school approach just won’t do. Maybe you’ve got an office job, more likely you don’t own a horse or there’s just no place to “park” a horse when you’re working. To handle situations like this, any government-owned vehicle (as you may recall, these have blue bars on their license plates) is required to give waiting people a ride along the way.\nThis policy is enforced at road-side transit stops (which look much like city bus stops), by government workers wearing mustard-colored uniforms. You’ll notice that they’re carrying clipboards so they can duly note how many passengers get on what vehicles (and more importantly, if any government-owned vehicles don’t stop to help out).\nThanks to their uniform, the local nickname for these workers is “amarillos,” from the Spanish word for “yellow.”\nThere do seem to be some official vehicles dedicated to the task of moving people from city to city — but I got the impression that most (if not all) of them are improvised, and definitely aren’t made for comfort.\nMany (if not most) of these vehicles don’t have seats, and the windows (when provided) appear to be something a North American would normally see in an RV or mobile home. Given the tropical climate and the vehicles’ lack of air conditioning, I’m guessing the windows are seen as being good enough.\nAt the very least, an improvised transport is likely a more-comfortable option than sharing a ride on whatever sort of truck is available.\nIn town, bicitaxis are all over the place (I’m guessing, but had no way of checking, that they’re a cheaper ride than motorized taxis).\nThese, by the way, are the more up-market models oriented toward tourists (the locals ride cheaper ones without roofs or padding on the seats.", "score": 0.844586253, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:2031ad33-23e4-4704-b1a3-83646ef0247d>", "text": "Cost Of Living In Cuba.

Much of the Cuban infrastructure lags behind many other countries and that includes banking and finances. ATM machines are extremely rare. Few, if any stores or restaurants accept credit card payments. Occasionally a larger hotel might accept credit card payments, some charging an extra fee to do so. In reality, bring cash because that is what you will need.\nTwo Cuban Currencies –\nFinancial transactions in Cuba require the use of Cuban currency. The government sets a standard exchange rate so there is really no reason to go looking for a better deal. It’s easiest to change your own currency for Cuban Pesos on arrival at the airport. You can do it later but you may find it difficult to locate a bank or currency exchange.\nCuba actually uses two different types of currencies. This may sound a bit confusing, but in practice it is not. Cubans use the Cuban Peso, known as the CUP, for their personal and daily transactions. The CUP is not available to travelers and tourists. As a traveler you don’t really need to worry about the CUP – you will likely never see any. (Even though never used by Americans, the U.S. Dollar to CUP valuation is around $1.00 = 26 CUP.)\nForeigners and tourists in Cuba use the Cuban Convertible Peso, knows as the CUC. The valuation of the CUC to U.S.Dollar is 1:1. Simple. Right? Well, it is, until you factor in the exchange fees and penalties noted below.\nCurrency Exchange Fees and Penalties –\nCuba levies a 3% fee when you exchange foreign currencies to or from Cuban Convertible Pesos.

Cuba has some unique requirements for issuing travel visas, and outsourcing the task can definitely free up your time to plan your time in Cuba.\nWhat are the U.S. passport requirements for Americans visiting Cuba?\nYour passport must be valid at the time of entry, and two pages are required for entry/exit stamps.\nWill I need a tourist visa to visit Cuba?\nYes. Although, technically tourist travel to Cuba remains prohibited. Your travel must fall into one of 12 categories of authorized travel. We can help you with that.\nAre any vaccinations required to visit Cuba?\nCurrently, no vaccinations are required, but Hepatitis A is often recommended as water and foods may be contaminated. Dengue fever and the Zika virus are also prevalent.\nIs it true U.S. credit cards don’t work in Cuba?\nIt’s true. U.S. credit and debit cards do not work in Cuba. You will need to bring cash to cover your stay. The Cuban government will require tourists to declare any amounts over $5000 USD. Another point to note is that the Cuban government charges a 10% fee for all conversations from U.S. dollars, excluding electronic transactions or cash conversions in other currencies. When exchanging currency, use the state-run offices known as CADECAs.\nCan I bring Cuban pesos back to the U.S.?\nIt’s probably better not to try. Travelers may only export the equivalent of 5,000 USD in any currency other than the Cuban convertible pesos (CUC). Anyone wishing to export more than this amount must demonstrate evidence that the currency was acquired legitimately from a Cuban bank. (Source: U.S. State Department)\nIs Cuba safe?\nCuba is relatively stable and characterized by a strong military and police presence. According to the State Department, the U.S. government rates the threat of crime in Cuba as medium. With the recent influx of tourists to the island, there has been an increase in the number of property crimes, as well as violent crimes.

By the end of the 16th century Taxco had become famed throughout the world for the beauty & wealth of its silver. Early Conquistadors admired Silver and had horse regalia made from the metal which then spread the popularity of using Silver in adornments of all sorts, including Jewelry, to Mexico City and beyond.\nIt is of record that Francisco Vazquez de Coronado as well as Alvar Nunez Cabeza de Vaca, (Spanish Conquistadors), made it to what is now known as Southwestern United States (Arizona and New Mexico) by 1542 in quest of Silver and Gold which makes us believe the Native Americans became aware of these precious metals at that period. We do know the Conquistadors followed after and certainly by the mid 1700's with Silver regalia on their horses. We also know that the Navajo traded with the Conquistadors for fancy horse bits and posibly other regalia. Spaniard Conquistadors most likely taught the Native Americans Blacksmithing by the early 1800's as that trade was necessary to maintain horse drawn equipment.\nRead more at: http://www.newmexicohistory.org\nBy 1860, and most likely earlier, Atsidi Sani, a Navajo blacksmith, was taught Silversmithing by the Spaniards and Western Silver began in Southwestern North America, (now known as Arizona and New Mexico). As Silver was bright and shiny, Native Americans were attracted to it immediately and pieces made by the early Navajo Silversmiths were in high demand by Native Peoples throughout the Southwest. Western Silver and the Silversmithing trade spread rapidly. By 1880, Turquoise was introduced into Silver adornments made by the Navajos and Western Silver Jewelry items such as Bracelets, Rings, Earrings and Concho Belts with Turquoise became even more desirable by the Native Peoples and soon white Settlers and Indian Traders.\nIndian Traders of the Southwest brought Western Silver and Turquoise made by the Navajo Indians to Southern California which was in a full boom.", "score": 0.799343, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:5e81093f-59a7-4b2a-8ecf-e470175479c7>", "text": "The Beginning of the Jewelry Silversmith Era\nOne might argue that this historical context has little to do with the development of Indian jewelry as we know it. However, the Hopi and Pueblo cultures of the Rio Grande are descendants of the Anasazi and, many believe, from the Mogollon and Mimbres. So it seems to be a valid beginning of a historic tracing.\nThe Navajo, on the other hand, entered the area fairly recently. Some say as early as the 14th century; others, as late as the early 16th. The Navajo, whenever they arrived, were undoubtedly influenced by the existing Pueblo cultures and later by the early Spanish.\nIt was actually the Navajo who were instrumental in spreading the art of silversmithing to other Southwest tribes. Prior to European contact, north american tribes used silver to make beads, but did not make elaborate jewelry from this metal.\nThe Navajo were in constant contact with the Spanish as they populated the Southwest from the late 16th century on. From these people, the Indians developed a great appreciation for personal adornment. Some of the early Spanish designs such as the Moorish inspired crescent and the pomegranate blossom became key to Navajo jewelry design.\nThe Navajo wore ornaments they obtained from those they conquered and from their trading partners. These ornaments were made from German silver (a copper-nickel-zinc substance that is bright and wears well, but contains no actual silver), copper, brass and to a much lesser extent, silver.\nWearing a cross or the crescent-shaped naja on a rawhide necklace was likely an ornament of beauty and pride to the native american indian, who valued it as a jewelry item and symbol of their wealth, not as a reflection of their appreciation for Christianity or for the Moorish influence on the Spanish.\nIf one person had such an ornament, others were likely to want one, or if possible, something even better. Thus the pendant cross evolved, as did the naja, into a multitude of variations and blends. The simple thong on which they were once displayed gave way to stone, shell, silver, or other metal beads over time.\nAtsidi Sani (“Old Smith”) was the first Navajo silversmith.

About Sterling Silver Jewelry Sterling Silver History Experts believe that silver alloy, used today as sterling silver, originated in continental Europe in the 12th century. Pure silver was found to be a soft and easily damageable material. When combined with other metals, most commonly cooper, it produced a tougher material that could be heavily relied on. Throughout the next few centuries, sterling silver was used as currency and for household items. It was often used as silverware and became the material used in a proper table setting between 1840 and 1940 throughout the United States and Europe. Because of this popularity, silver companies began to grow.", "score": 0.0017413111378641408, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:3b9b1977-9284-48f7-874c-4e5057a05c2a>", "text": "Q1: Can I have a sample order?\nA: Yes.

Not even fish live beneath its alkaline surface. But like a tiny Evel Knievel, the brine fly dives straight into the soup. The trick, according to a new study: an air “submarine” the insect builds to protect itself from the extreme environment.\nMono Lake is three times saltier and much more alkaline than the ocean, making it a challenge for anything to live there. The only year-round inhabitants are photosynthetic algae and tiny shrimp that thrive in the brine. But come summer, its shores are crawling with Ephydra hydropyrus, brine flies that are slightly smaller than the common house fly. They eat algae clinging to stones on the shore and underwater rocks. In turn, they provide tasty meals to millions of spiders and migratory birds, establishing themselves as a key link in the lake’s food web.\nBut just diving into the water doesn’t make the flies special. Lots of insects can submerge themselves in freshwater for hours—and even days—at a time. Their waxy outer coats repel water like oil, sometimes to such a degree that they have trouble slipping under the surface. Unless a diving insect gets up enough force to submerge itself, it can pop right back out like a cork. To breathe, most diving insects trap and carry small air bubbles.\nBut the brine fly goes to extremes, Floris van Breugel, a neuroethologist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena has discovered, completely encasing itself in a layer of air. Thus protected from the deadly saltwater, it can dive up to 2 meters to feed and lay its eggs. Using high-speed video and special platforms that measure how much force the insect exerts as it crawls into the water, Van Breugel compared the fly’s activity in the lab in both typical freshwater and water from Mono Lake.\nAs it carefully crawls into the water, the insect’s water-repellent coat and microscopic hairs trap a layer of air next to the body that keeps the water out. When it emerges at last, the fly pops out and flies away, completely dry. To keep from getting wet, it has to surface upright and not disrupt the air layer prematurely.", "score": 0.880288541, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:6a502380-a220-4d96-9d39-e27ee4ad0235>", "text": "Living in an Alkaline Environment\nA WebQuest Exploring the Life and Ecology of Mono Lake\nIntroduction Task Process Resources Evaluation Conclusion Teachers\nMono Lake lies in a lifeless, treeless, hideous desert...

Over a dozen mallards, a great blue heron, three avocets and several dumped domestic ducks have already died.\nDuring the hot August days, our local lakes, ponds and canals naturally suffer a drop in water quality, an increase in algae blooms, and sudden outbreaks of toxic botulism. While these are natural phenomena, they are more preventable and manageable than Salt Lake County officials would have you believe. Botulism outbreaks can be minimized by removing excess sediment from lakes, increasing water flow in hot months, adding aerators to improve water oxygenation and regularly removing garbage and debris from the water.\nSignage can also discourage residents from exacerbating poor water quality by throwing bread into the lake for the birds. All of these measures have recently helped Sugarhouse Park pond recover from a botulism outbreak just last August that killed nearly 100 ducks and ducklings.\nBack in the early 1990s, Decker Lake grabbed the attention of local residents, who—with the help of then Senator Jake Garn—secured $1 million in federal grant money to build Decker Lake into an educational wetlands preserve.

Brine shrimp are also known to be very good at eating algae and other debris from the tank, which helps keep the water clean.\nDo Brine Shrimp Need Light\nDo Brine Shrimp Need Light?\nBrine shrimp are a type of crustacean that is often used as fish food. They are small and have a hard exoskeleton.\nBrine shrimp can live in saltwater or freshwater, but they cannot tolerate changes in salinity very well. Because of this, they are often found in salt lakes or near the ocean. Brine shrimp do not need light to survive, but they do need it to reproduce.\nThe female brine shrimp lays her eggs in a bubble of air at the water surface. These eggs hatch into larvae which fall to the bottom and develop into adults. If there is no light, the larvae will not develop properly and will die before reaching adulthood.\nBrine Shrimp Experiment\nBrine shrimp are a small, hardy crustacean that can live in extremely salty water. Because of this, they are often used in experiments to study the effects of high salt levels on other organisms.\nIn one such experiment, brine shrimp were placed in water with increasingly higher salt concentrations.\nThe results showed that the shrimp could tolerate up to 30% salt concentration without any adverse effects. However, at 35% salt concentration, the shrimp began to die off. This experiment shows that even small increases in salt concentration can have deleterious effects on organisms that are not adapted to living in such conditions.\nIt is important to be aware of this when conducting experiments and managing ecosystems, as even seemingly small changes can cause big impacts.\nAre Brine Shrimp Actually Shrimp?\nBrine shrimp are not actually shrimp, but are more closely related to krill and barnacles. Brine shrimp are small crustaceans that live in salt water and can withstand very high levels of salinity. They are an important food source for many animals, including fish, birds, and even some mammals.\nHow Long Do Brine Shrimp Live?\nBrine shrimp are a type of crustacean that is commonly found in salt lakes and brine pools.

Over time this created a pretty amazing dataset on the Lake Abert food web.”\nEventually, Kreuz’s Lake Abert business became a casualty of the salinity-linked uncertainty in the fluctuations from year to year in abundance of brine shrimp. When species like brine shrimp can no longer be sustained in the lake, this affects just about every other species in the local ecosystem.\n“This is really what we would call a ‘trophic cascade’ where the direct effects of environmental change on one species have cascading effects on the other species in the ecosystem,” remarks Senner. “High salinities are difficult for pretty much all species—except microbes—to tolerate. Birds living in saltwater environments have to eat more than those in freshwater systems because of the increased amount of energy required to deal with all of that salt.

Brady Glacier is Abyss Lake's primary inflow source. The glacier's melted water flows east to an adjacent basin, and the water accumulates to form Abyss Lake, which maintains an average depth of ten meters (33 feet). The lake deposits much of the glacial meltwater to the surrounding bodies of water -- namely, the Dundas River, Dundas Bay (its main outflow), and Cross Sound.\nAbyss Lake is part of the Glacier Bay National Park and Preserve, one of the nation's largest parks. The lake is a popular fishing spot for the residents of rural Skagway-Hoonan-Angoon County, but it is best to consult local guides before heading to Abyss to fish. Abyss Lake can sometimes be a dangerous destination, because there are occasional glacial lake outburst floods when much of the lake's water propels into Dundas Bay in tidal size waves, dragging along whole trees, ice chunks, sediments, and boats.\nThe first official record of an Abyss Lake flood was on September 17, 1994. Since then, this natural event has been documented as occurring in 1997, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2005, 2006, and twice in 2008. The flood waters build up because Brady Glacier acts as a dam. During the summer, water pressure builds as the lake rises. Each outburst is the completion of one of Abyss Lake's cycles.\nOver the past decade, the frequency of flood outbursts is increasing. Abyss Lake's normal size is about 635 surface acres and 575 meters wide (1886 feet). However, the lake drains considerably after a flood, at which times all visitors will be stunned by a very wide and silver \"bathtub ring\" that surrounds whatever waters remain of the drained and low Abyss Lake.

The ensemble builds to a long-held, ecstatic chord over which the soloist recalls the singing lines of the work’s opening; eventually, this fades away until just the high winds are left, calling like birds into the silence.\nThe cello concerto Dawn (2008) consists of three movements, each of which is based on a fragment of poetry by Hai Zi (1964–1989), one of the most famous poets in mainland China in the 1980s. However, Qin’s music is not intended to depict or ‘explain’ the poetry, but rather to function as a counterpoint to Hai Zi’s words. Thus, whilst certain musical devices appear to reflect aspects of the poetic scenes (the stillness of the very opening; birds chirruping in winds and strings through the first movement; a striking contrast between frenzied activity and total stillness in the second movement as if the music is seen from ‘near... and yet... so far away’), there are also moments of high contrast and vibrant orchestral colours that find no direct parallels in the text, but seem to complement the images depicted.\nThe suona concerto Calling for Phoenix (2010) is an orchestral adaptation of a work written by Qin in 1996 for traditional Chinese instruments. The suona is a small double-reed instrument a little like a shawm, traditionally used in music for public occasions such as wedding and funeral processions; similarly, it is employed in Chinese opera to mark significant events or the arrival of important characters. This seems entirely appropriate given the subject matter of the piece: the phoenix is a symbol of virtue, grace, loyalty and honesty in Chinese legend, the perfect balance of Yin and Yang. Qin was inspired to compose Calling for Phoenix after viewing the painting series Phoenix in Fire by Xiao-he Tang and Li Cheng, and being struck in particular by the vitality and spiritual richness of the images.", "score": 0.840414703, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:333c6846-babb-43f8-83e2-46244e16d28a>", "text": "According to Tan Dun, “Water is a metaphor for the unity of the ephemeral and the eternal, the physical and the spiritual—as well as a symbol of baptism, renewal, re-creation and resurrection.”\nWith the Paper Concerto (2003), Tan Dun created another work which is as fascinating to see as it is to hear. To create various sounds with large sheets of paper, the soloists move all over the stage creating a work which is a choreographically intricate as it is musically inventive.\nAward-Winning Film Scores and Multimedia Extravaganzas\nWhile Tan Dun’s incorporation of the most fundamental and ancient sonic elements—such as water and paper—into the fabric of the orchestra have created a whole new sonic vocabulary, he has also created a series of works which enhance the audiovisual experience of the orchestra through the latest technologies.\nTan Dun’s acute attention to the visual elements of making sounds has made him an extremely sensitive composer for motion pictures and he is now highly sought after by directors in Hollywood and around the world. His film scores include the Academy Award-winning soundtrack for Ang Lee’s Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (2000), Zhang Yimou’s Hero (2002), and the Denzel Washington vehicle Fallen (1998).\nBut whereas in motion pictures, music is just one element which must blend in with a larger totality of sight and sound to meet the director’s vision, Tan Dun has recently embarked on a series of works in which video images are elements which blend in with an overarching musical structure. Tan Dun turned the tables on the film-scoring process with his 2000 Crouching Tiger Concerto for cello, video and chamber orchestra. Each of the works six movements contains footage from the film. But here the music inspired reshaping the video images to serve as an accompaniment and an enhancement to the listening experience rather than imparting narrative meaning.\nTan’s most remarkable application of video thus far, however, is The Map (2002), another concerto for cello, video, and orchestra.

The malleable sonic nature of string instruments is constantly exploited, sliding up and down between pitches and pressing semitones and even quartertones closely together within the ensemble writing. As the movement progresses, the forceful rhythms of speech-like patterns from the whole orchestra are contrasted with passages in which the pulse seems suspended, the strings and soloist holding the line as if in space. The second movement makes use of a short segment of Shanxi folk song, the writing more lyrical and almost religious in character. The song itself, Couples are happy together, but you are not here, is the story of a woman alone among married friends, since her husband has had to travel far away to find work.

But there is no doubt that Finzi's style is far more distinctive both in his earlier works and when he is writing for the voice. Nowhere is this more so than in Dies Natalis, his setting for tenor or soprano and string orchestra of texts from Centuries of Meditation by Thomas Traherne which was given its first performance in 1940.\nFinzi, seen in the photos above and below, composed several Traherne settings and his passion for a recondite 17th century metaphysical English poet is sometimes invoked as evidence of the composer's melancholy and conservative nature. But in fact Traherne's poetry appears in some surprising places. For instance his verse appeared in the lyrics of the 1960s psychedelic folk group The Incredible String Band, in the 2006 film Amazing Grace about the abolition of slavery, and in a 1992 science fiction novel by David Zindell. Traherne's poetry was also a strong influence on Thomas Merton, who cites him numerous times in his journals and essays.\nMany of Finzi's compositions evolved over long periods and Dies Natalis, which translates as Day of Birth, was actually started in the mid-1920s. But it was only in response to a commission for the 1939 Three Choirs Festival that Finzi completed it. Dies Natalis, which despite its title is sung in English, is a celebration of childhood innocence which is often heard at Christmas. There are five movements opening with a lyrical instrumental Intrada and the structure follows that of a Bach cantata. Although Dies Natalis was completed on schedule, the 1939 Three Choirs Festival was cancelled due to the outbreak of war and the first performance was delayed until January 1940 when it was given by the soprano Elsie Suddaby, one of the sixteen original soloists in Vaughan Williams' Serenade to Music, with Maurice Miles conducting his own string orchestra.\nFortunately Dies Natalis is well served in the CD catalogue.

The effect was a success for the most part.\nLikewise, a splendid performance of Derek Charke’s Tree Rings for violin and marimba made a decided impact on its audience chiefly for its thoughtful and musically engaging story. A fine staged moment at the beginning set the improvisational feel of the work, featuring John Lowrey’s senza misura off-stage entrance from the back of the Bella.\nTree Rings is a condensed tone poem in quasi-cyclic form emulating the life cycle of a majestic tree. Each minute of music could mysteriously encapsulate decades or even centuries of the tree’s life as told within its internally mapped-out ring structure. The conceit is doubly effective: the cycling through of ideas from section to section added to the imagery of temporal compression depicting tree rings metaphorically traversing time, evinced brilliantly through the work’s arpeggiated violin line and final section of impressive ostinato mallet playing. Here is a splendid work, one that needs to be heard several more times to be understood better still.\nLuna Pearl Wolff’s Entanglement was inspired by Mélange à Trois, an instrumental theatre work that featured percussionist Krystina Marcoux who used the body of a cello for her instrument. Here the premise is smartly transformed into a piece listed as a cello and percussion duo. However, the work is really a cello solo work overlaid, quite literally, by Glennie’s arms appearing to percuss the instrument while she hunches behind Sandvoss who bows the same instrument. While the cello is bowed by one player and struck and caressed by the other, it appears that Sandvoss suddenly is using four arms to play, giving the instrument a sensual quality, perhaps best summarized as an opera aria for cello, entangling a dramatic theatricality and an erotic intimacy between instrument and performer(s).\nWoolf seems to have carefully considered the relationship of physicality to the performers’ bodies, for example their height, physical performance characteristics and their physical relationship with the instrument.", "score": 0.805077, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:6c874fb6-cafc-47ad-8d56-ebf8e3eff027>", "text": "… besides how to play Italian songs with as much schmaltz as possible and how to avoid stabbing the servers with my bow.\nIt's fitting that such an elegaic concerto is the last concerto of our letters.

Although the poet Philip Larkin would probably take issue with the expressiveness of Elgar's concerto – he preferred understatement, probably to a fault – I can't help but think of Larkin's poem \"MCMXIV,\" an elegy for the year 1914, the last year untouched by the horror of truly modern warfare.

Despite the popularity, Beethoven was correct when he wrote about his Triple Concerto \"that a concertante with these three solo parts is something new.\" The novelty lay in the usage of this connection with the piano. The difference between the piano's method of tone production and that of the other instruments alongside the piano's \"mechanics\" resulted in tonal problems. These problems arose both within the solo trio and in its relationship to the orchestra. Beethoven, who was interested throughout his whole career in experiments to extend the scope of instrumental music, here combined the styles of chamber music and of concertante symphonic writing.\nFerenc Fricsay conducting the Berlin Radio Symphony Orchestra performing Beethoven's Triple Concerto in C major, Op. 56 with Anda, Schneiderhan, and Fournier.\n• 180g Vinyl\nBerlin Radio Symphony Orchestra\nFerenc Fricsay, conductor\nGeza Anda, piano\nWolfgang Schneiderhan, violin\nPierre Fournier, cello\nLudwig Van Beethoven (1770-1827)\nConcerto for Piano, Violin, Cello and Orchestra in C major, Op. 56\n2.

On closer examination it seems that the 1st and 4th Concerto require\ndifferent types of bass. The different nomenclatures, between the 1st and the 4th Concerto, could be better explained if we start from the assumption that Bach uses two names to indicate, in\nfact, three instruments. In fact, the part of Violone Concerto No. 4 suggests certain physiognomy characteristics that allude to a part from bass. As part of the filling, the violone never plays\nan independent role, but a sort of small part of the line continually, this approach simplifies the cello part. Bach also try to reduce the \"load\" of the violone, writing, occasionally, his part\nan octave higher. In this way, violone and cello work in unison and this happens not only when the change Violone weaving so as to avoid the serious C. Although Bach did not avoid completely the\nspace of two octaves between cello and violone writing notes of the bass octave serious, these procedures have never extended a long time.

An L/C/R button can turn any of these delay types into multi-tap with left/center/right panning options. Kosmic, Reverse, and Pitch modes can create some very cool effects, but most users will likely focus on the wide range of traditional delay options available from the Delay Time section (1-4000 ms of delay, L/R control, and sync), Regeneration section (feedback level, polarity invert, and high/low-pass filters), and Modulation section (waveform shape, intensity, and frequency). There are a lot of the standard performance controls as well (including tap tempo, MIDI, and preset store/recall), so if you're looking for something for your live rig, this would be a strong contender. Overall, I'm very impressed with this pedal, and I ended up buying it.\nDownsides? Well, there are a few. I couldn't get Analog and Tape modes to freak-out with too much regenerative feedback the way you can with a real analog delay (something the all- digital BOSS RE-20 Roland Space Echo pedal emulates perfectly). Depending on your point of view, this could be a plus or a minus. On the other hand, I was getting some very cool, unique sounds out of the SDD-3000 Pedal when I tweaked the delay time and/or feedback controls in real-time. It's not quite able to simulate the pitch shift you get on an analog device when you do that, but the sound of the processor freaking out was super cool and unique in its own way, and may inspire a new trend in sonically abusing pedals. Also, the pedal will store 80 presets, but the only way to access these is by stepping through them using footswitches, which feels a bit clunky in the studio.

In addition to the original SDD-3000 delay, there's also analog delay modeling that provides the warmth of a BBD device, a TAPE model that reproduces a tape echo, the clean MODERN delay sound, the fantasy-like KOSMIC delay which adds pitch change to the reverb sound, REVERSE which plays the delay sound backward, a pitch shifter placed before the delay, and PANNING which controls the stereo position of the output.

The thick, preamp sound that distinguished the SDD-3000 was a decisive aspect of its character. Many musicians even used the SDD-3000 in a bypassed state simply as a preamp in order to obtain this effect. It goes without saying that the SDD-3000 PEDAL faithfully replicates this preamp. Ample gain and headroom are maintained, and input/output attenuators are also provided. This lets you set the input/output levels optimally when using this unit, meaning that in addition to guitar, you can use it with a variety of instruments including analog synthesizers, keyboards, and vintage effects, and be confident that the SDD-3000 PEDAL's potential will be maximized for any audio source.", "score": 0.17131169633118898, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:dd0f750a-03f5-455d-a9ff-64d86ad665f2>", "text": "If every DAW in existence ships with several free delay plug- ins, why is Soundtoys EchoBoy one of the best-selling plug-ins on the market? Moreover, why would you want to spend your hard-earned cash on a hardware digital delay? I guess the answer is that people care about delay-based effects. And while I'm a huge EchoBoy fan and user, I sometimes just want to twist some knobs to come up with a sound that's less predictable than what most plug-ins will give me.\nWe have several analog bucket-brigade device (BBD) delay pedals in our studio, along with a vintage Roland Space Echo and a Fulltone Tube Tape Echo [Tape Op #51]. Despite the ease in pulling up a plug-in, the hardware tape delays and BBD pedals see a lot of use, even though they take more time to set up. But I also spend more time repairing the tape delays than I do just about any other piece of gear in the studio, so I'm always on the lookout for other cool delay effects that are more reliable and that clients and musicians will find interesting and inspiring. I've looked at some vintage delays like the Marshall Time Modulator (amazing but very pricey), but one of the reasons that I think the tape delays get a lot of use is that they can be patched to a line-level signal (with a re-amp device) or directly fed by a guitar or keyboard. This is one of the attractions to the SDD-3000 Pedal, as it's basically a big stompbox with very versatile I/O.\nThe SDD-3000 Pedal, as its name implies, is a reincarnation — in pedal format — of the '80s-era SDD-3000, which was a 1RU- height rackmount box popular with guitarists back in its day. U2's The Edge and William Orbit were two well-known users. Like the original, the input and output of the SDD-3000 Pedal can be switched between three different reference levels (-30, -10, and +4 dBu input; -20, -10, and +4 dBu output), so the unit is equally at home in the studio or in a guitar rig.

By using the inverter to reverse the phase of the delay sound, you can also obtain flanging effects.\nFive types of modulation waveforms to modulate the delay time One of the characteristics of the SDD-3000 was its modulation capability for modulating the delay time. This function dramatically expands the range of delay sounds, giving you even more expressive power.

His mythic accounts—which reflect a vibrant blending of history, legends, and folktales—have been instrumental in bringing recognition to Latin American authors for their significant contribution to contemporary world literature.\nGabriel José García Márquez was born on March 6, 1928, in Aracataca, a small Colombian village in the banana country coastal region. The eldest of twelve children of Luisa Santiaga Márquez Iguarán and Gabriel Eligio García, García Márquez was reared by maternal grandparents. He grew up in a huge house with an extended family of aunts and great aunts who, like his grandmother, were constant storytellers of local myth, superstition, and legend. His grandfather, a retired colonel, was the most important figure in García Márquez’s life. He filled the boy with tales of the civil wars of 1899-1903 and of past times, and young García Márquez himself developed a nostalgia for the way things used to be. Such childhood influences are reflected in García Márquez’s fiction—which abounds with old houses, ancient matriarchs, nostalgia, civil wars, colonels, and banana companies—and many of his works are set in Macondo, a fictional village with a strong resemblance to Aracataca.\nIn 1936, his grandfather died, and García Márquez was sent first to school in Barranquilla, then to the National Secondary School in Zipaquirá. After graduation in 1946, he was enrolled in the National University of Colombia in Bogotá to study law. During this time, he also read poetry avidly and began to write short stories. In 1947, his first story, “La tercera resignación” (“The Third Resignation”), was published in the Bogotá newspaper El Espectador, and, during the next five years, he published many others therein. Though most were immature and hard to understand, these stories presaged the Surrealist quality of his later fiction.\nIn 1948, an assassination in Bogotá initiated a civil revolution in Colombia that politicized García Márquez’s writing and provided source material for his later works.", "score": 0.817127466, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:e0b1e1eb-815f-49db-98f3-60fbb899e0fc>", "text": "Garcia Marquez suggests that the members of the town-almost all of whom could have stopped the murder-abet it both through their actions and their inactions.\nThe importance of honor to the culture portrayed in Chronicle of a Death Foretold is evident throughout the novel. The murder itself is committed in order to gain back the honor that Angela lost when she had premarital sex, and the honor that was lost to the family with her sex and then failed marriage. Most people in the society tend to think that disputes over honor are better left to those involved; even the jury in the Vicario twins' case find them innocent, because they killed Santiago to win back Angela's honor.\nThis is another important theme linked to the novel's depiction of Latin American culture. When Angela has premarital sex, and married as a non-virgin, she not only dishonors her family but also fails in her duty to them. According to the society portrayed in Chronicle of a Death Foretold, Angela has an obligation to stay a virgin and marry to as high a station as she can (even though she doesn't love the man she marries); if she hadn't had premarital sex, she would have married a very wealthy man. Other characters also have a duty to their family. Among the Vicario's, Pedro goes off to war to earn money for the family, while Pablo stays home to take care of his parents.\nThe first sentence in chapter five reads \"For years we couldn't talk about anything else.\" Garcia Marquez depicts a society in which everyone in the town knows about the murder that is going to happen except for the man who is going to be murdered-until it's too late. This is one of the central ironies of the book: that everyone is so eager to talk about the murder, but no one is willing to talk about it to the murderer. The natural human tendency to \"talk behind someone's back\" thus becomes responsible, in part, for a killing.\nAlso, Garcia Marquez shows us that human memory, as represented by gossip, is fragmented and inconsistent. Like a \"big fish\" story, the tale of Santiago's death has undergone a gradual transformation in the town's memory up until the time, twenty-seven years after, when the narrator records it.

Ordinary readers as well as the most sophisticated critics and scholars praise his works. He creates epic, complicated plots with stories about local and family life that are full of humor, irony, and even comedy. The novels are mainly set in small-town Colombia, where traditional and modern practices and beliefs meet in both tragic and comic scenes.\nMarquez is best known as a great writer for inventing the literary technique known as “magical realism,” where he distorts perspectives. He is able in his writing and storytelling to make the fantastical seem normal. In one scene, the hot hands of children who have lived their whole lives in the tropics, miraculously create ice. It appears completely natural in the context of the story. In another scene, a young woman’s sudden rise into heaven is considered normal in her community.\nPerhaps Colombia was the perfect place for such literature to develop. As Marquez himself said, “Caribbean reality resembles the wildest imagination.” Magical realism reflected the Colombian world that he knew, a world in which instability and revolution were always just beneath the surface.\nSource: Gabriel Garcia Marquez (1927 – 2014)\n© 2004 – 2020 No Sweat Digital Ltd.

Gabriel García Márquez\nSeveral outlets are reporting the death of Gabriel García Márquez, the Nobel Prize-winning Colombian author of 100 Years of Solitude and Love in the Time of Cholera, at the age of 87. Following a decade and a half of declining health, including a successful fight with lymphatic cancer (diagnosed in 1999) and the onset of Alzheimer’s Disease (made public in 2012), a dehydrated Márquez was hospitalised earlier this month with infections of the lungs and urinary tract, ultimately succumbing to pneumonia.\nBorn in the Colombian municipality of Aracataca in 1927, Márquez’s career as a writer began in journalism, working as a reporter for El Espectador and acting as the paper’s foreign correspondent, stationed variously in Rome, Paris, Barcelona, Caracas and New York. The 1962 publication of his first novel, La mala hora (In Evil Hour), was preceded by the novellas La Hojarasca (Leaf Storm, 1955) and El coronel no tiene quien le escriba (No One Writes to the Colonel, 1961), and a handful of short stories. It was, however, Márquez’s second novel that would bring him his most lasting fame – 1967’s Cien años de soledad (One Hundred Years of Solitude), the story of seven generations of a single family in the fictional town of Macondo, would become one of the most lauded novels written in the 20th century, selling more than 30 million copies worldwide and forever associating its author with magic realism.\nMárquez continued to work to great acclaim into the 00s, though it is perhaps startling to realise, given the scope of his influence, that after Solitude he would only write another four novels: El otoño del patriarca (The Autumn of the Patriarch, 1975), El amor en los tiempos del cólera (Love in the Time of Cholera, 1985), El general en su laberinto (The General in his Labyrinth, 1989) and Del amor y otros demonios (Of Love and Other Demons, 1994).", "score": 0.811415076, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:ca500f10-c158-4a1a-b382-462d84f7e713>", "text": "The Bug, one of Earth's greatest heroes has been brutally murdered and his butchered body has been left for the world to see.

José Luis, summoned to prison, tries to argue his way out of killing a man. But he’s dressed as a tourist and has been provided with both a cigarette and a glass of champagne, undercutting his attempts to make a very serious point. Once his arguments have been quashed, and his bid to quit this terrible job dismissed as inhumane toward the condemned man, an attempt is made to transform him into a more dignified official by putting a necktie on him. The prison director is played by Guido Alberti, best known as the producer in Fellini’s 8½, an actor practiced in persuading protagonists to carry out onerous, soul-endangering work, whether it be state execution or the making of motion pictures.\nAs a final absurdity, Berlanga stages his most epic shot, in the chalky-white prison courtyard where the man condemned to die walks stoically toward his death, while the man condemned to kill him is inconsolable, occupying the attention of the guards and priest, playing to perfection the role of a man being led to his death. The reversal of attitudes is grimly hilarious, but the wide, institutional space gives laughter an unsettling echo.

And we know how that turned out. José Luis’s whole future can now be seen, a line of corpses-in-waiting stretched before him.

But mainstream stages in those days weren’t exactly embracing Latino stories. “Zoot Suit” carved a path that Chicano theater artists such as Luis Alfaro and Culture Clash are more easily treading today.\nThe fight for artistic visibility continues, but what makes this revival of “Zoot Suit” especially urgent now is the way its story speaks so directly to the current political moment, when fundamental constitutional values are being tested and law enforcement and racial justice appear to be at loggerheads.\n“Zoot Suit” centers on events that followed what the tabloids dubbed the “Sleepy Lagoon murder” of Aug. 2, 1942. Los Angeles police rounded up Mexican American youths in an overreaction to a crime that served demagogic ends. Suspected gang members, who were presumed to have taken part in a violent altercation that may have led to a young man’s death, were tried and convicted in a case that was exploited by politicians and sensationalized by the media.\nThe Zoot Suit riots of 1943, in which American servicemen and citizens attacked ethnic minorities dressed in a peacock manner that was considered unpatriotic during the war, could be linked to the fear and hostility that had been whipped up during the Sleepy Lagoon murder trial.

With the varied habitat that covers our Courses there are a great range of mammals and birds to see if you are sharp eyed.\nOne of the most common sights are the Brown Hares that are dotted all around the Links. These majestic animals are quite territorial and can put on a great show in the spring as they box each other. Unlike their close cousins the Rabbit, Hares live above ground and don’t damage the courses by digging holes everywhere!\nOther mammals which aren’t so easily seen are the stoats and weasels which are valuable allies as they predate heavily on rabbits. If you’re lucky you might catch a glimpse of one as it scurries across a fairway. Every so often the odd fox will set up home here, especially when rabbits are in plentiful supply.\nVery occasionally we might get a Roe Deer wandering across the Links, perhaps making its way to the Estuary or the sea to bathe an injured leg. This is more common in the early morning but they have been spotted at other times of day.\nThe rough is home to animals like shrews, voles, field mice, hedgehogs and even the Skylark. This is a native bird which is listed on the “Red List” of endangered species in the UK but we’re delighted to say they appear to be on the increase here at the Home of Golf. We are partly putting this down to the good environmental practices of our Greenkeepers as the rough is managed in a manner which keeps it relatively open and sparse making it ideal for ground nesting birds like the Skylark. Having the Hebridean sheep graze the area just off the 9th and 10th holes of the Jubilee Course has had the same effect.\nOther ground nesting birds commonly seen are Pied Wagtails, Meadow Pipits and Starlings while as evening falls you will notice Swallows and Swifts swoop over the greens collecting insects.\nIf your ball ends up in the infamous St Andrews gorse there is a chance you may spot birds like Yellowhammers, Linnets, Stonechats and Goldfinches.", "score": 0.831169426, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:d1b73855-f544-4d59-ae8b-30edd0ace93f>", "text": "Basking sharks, minke whales, porpoises and dolphins are among the sea life that can be seen on boat tours from Mull.\nThe island is home to a thriving population of otters (Lutra lutra) that live in coastal habitat, hunting during the day.

Pine marten have also recently become established on Mull. According to a paper by Scottish Natural Heritage  it is unlikely that pine martens have ever been native to the Isle of Mull. Based on sighting records, and from resulting modelling exercises, it is believed the species arrived in 2004 through accidental transportation on timber boats from the mainland.\nThe Hebridean Whale and Dolphin Trust was established in 1994 as a registered charity to pioneer practical, locally based education and monitoring programmes on cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises) in the Hebrides. The Trust is based out of Tobermory, where it has its main, education and research offices and a visitor centre.\nThere are also a number of invasive non-native species that occur on the island including invasive plant species such as Japanese knotweed, and invasive animals such as feral cats and American mink that are believed to be causing damage to the indigenous species populations through competition and predation.\nThe Tour of Mull is a closed road rally event held on the island every October. While some well off competitors benefit from superior cars, the locals benefit from their knowledge of the roads and thus anyone can win. \"The Best Rally In The World\" is the title of a book written by the founder of the event, Brian Molyneux.

Nowhere was that more apparent than in Texas, where artists like Blind Willie Johnson created a dazzling body of work that perfectly bridged the gap between gospel and blues.\n“If I Had My Way I’d Tear the Building Down” (Columbia 14343-D, 1928)\nTexas blues musicians were known for big, expressive voices, but perhaps none more so than Blind Willie Johnson, a preacher and street musician who sang gospel music with a decidedly blues feel. Johnson endured almost unfathomable hardships in his life: he was blinded by his stepmother, who threw lye in his face as a child; and he subsequently spent his entire life in and out of poverty before dying of pneumonia one winter while living in the ashes of his burned-down house. But despite his troubles, his faith remained strong and compelled him to make some of the most incredible music ever recorded.\nThis song is Johnson’s retelling of the Samson and Delilah story from the Bible, and is one of the best examples of Johnson’s distinct, gravel-voiced delivery. Compared to the sublime beauty of his most famous record, “Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground,” the impact of his voice here may be jarring, but it is every bit as amazing. He opens the song with a chorus sung in a deep growl, then switches to a conventional, subdued voice for the first verse. He sounds quite good doing so, as he recounts the basic facts of the story. As he hits the chorus, however, his voice again rises and from that point on he stays at an emotional high and maintains the growling, passionate voice. It makes for quite exciting story-telling.\nJohnson picks guitar in the conventional way here, rather than playing slide. While his guitar picking doesn’t follow the jazzy template of his Texas contemporaries like Blind Lemon Jefferson, it is nonetheless solid and serves to create a fast-paced, compelling rhythm that adds to the excitement.\n~ You may also like: Blind Willie Johnson, “I’m Gonna Run to the City of Refuge” (Columbia 14391-D, 1929)\nBlind Willie Johnson\n“Dark Was the Night, Cold Was the Ground” (Columbia 14303-D, 1928)\nListen to this record and you will immediately feel the power of Johnson’s delivery.", "score": 0.820714474, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:65e8618c-894f-4d70-b3c3-7c787463e704>", "text": "Blind Willie Johnson, (born January 22, 1897, Independence, near Brenham, Texas, U.S.—died September 18, 1945, Beaumont, Texas), African American gospel singer who performed on Southern streets and was noted for the energy and power of his singing and for his ingenious guitar accompaniments.\nLittle is known about Johnson’s early life, though a death certificate provided the date and location of his birth. He grew up in rural eastern Texas. When he was seven years old, his stepmother, fighting with his father, threw lye in Johnson’s face, permanently blinding him. From his youth he sang gospel songs, accompanying himself on guitar, for donations on the streets of small towns and cities, mostly in Texas.\nJohnson recorded 30 songs in Dallas, Texas, and Atlanta, Georgia, in 1927–30. His strong voice was a rough low baritone; joined with his urgently rhythmic guitar, his harsh singing achieved great force in “If I Had My Way I’d Tear the Building Down,” a narrative of the biblical Samson and Delilah story. While most of his recordings conveyed similar potency, he created a unique joining of vocal moaning with slide guitar lines in the slow, haunting “Dark Was the Night—Cold Was the Ground,” a song about Christ’s Crucifixion.

The latter is a result of linear thinking which disregards harmony in an academic sense. In groups of several players, this conception can lead to heterophony with strict metre; a good example is archaic jazz. Even when employing a certain chord sequence a 'country' bluesman would make the changes when he felt like it. Used to playing alone, he shows the tendency to corrupt the harmonic and metric scheme when performing with a band. 'He's breaking time,' a trained musician would say.\"\nThis description by Karl Gert zur Heide of bluesmen making chord changes \"when he felt like it\" is fully consistent with Lee Ree Sullivan's description of the highly improvisational way that Boogie Woogies were being played in Liberty Eylau community near Texarkana, Texas, at least as late as the 1950s.\nAnother correlation between the relatively unstructured early Boogie Woogies and the later more-structured Boogie Woogies is the fact that the more structured forms tended to occur in urban settings, rather than in the relatively more rural settings where Boogie Woogie originated. Indeed, the greater \"civilized\" social structure of the large cities could very well have been a bias that constrained Boogie Woogie into its more structured forms recorded in the 1930s and 1940s by those who wanted to imitate, or at least approximate, performances of the earlier Boogie Woogie players. In a discussion of Blind Lemon Jefferson, Robert Palmer made statements about rural bluesmen that are also just as true for and corroborate the limited structure in the earliest Boogie Woogies, which also occurred in relatively unstructured, less \"civilized\" rural settings. Specifically, in \"Black Snake Moan: The History of Texas Blues,\" (page 94, Guitar World, September, 1996).\n\"Many rural bluesmen habitually drop a beat or a bar or add a half-bar or more to the standard twelve-bar verse, resulting in actual verse lengths of twelve and a half, thirteen, or thirteen and a half bars -- often in the same tune.

The edge-of-your-seat approach to improvisation is what makes Jefferson classics like 'Match Box Blues,' 'See That My Grave Is Kept Clean,' and 'That Black Snake Moan' perennially rewarding and surprising.\"\nThe fact that Sammy Price has indicated that Jefferson's \"booga rooga\" style of guitar playing was the basis for Pine Top Smith's Boogie Woogie bass figures suggests an intimate connection between Jefferson's relatively unstructured way of playing and that of the earliest Boogie Woogie players.\nIt also appears that, even when rural settings are compared to each other, Texas was associated with less structured blues forms than other rural settings where blues was played. For example, in his article \"What Is American Music?,\" (Down Beat, February 27, 1975) Robert Palmer wrote:\n\"The Texas school (metrically free, in contrast to the more rigorously structured Mississippi styles), Georgia school (extremely lyrical blues, twelve-string guitars), and many others have been preserved on 78 rpm records, most of which are now available on reissue LPs.\"\nPalmer also describes another contrast between Texas blues and Delta blues, which might very well be causally connected with the relative lack of structure in Texas blues. Specifically, in \"Black Snake Moan: The History of Texas Blues,\" (page 102, Guitar World, September, 1996), Palmer states:\n\"Delta blues is a kind of sacred music, opposed to the church but espousing its own African-rooted spiritual values. In Texas, on the other hand, blues tends to be resolutely, unapologetically secular, sensuous, even carnal -- like rock and roll.\"\nMoreover, Robert Palmer's comments are consistent with the idea that the relatively less-structured and \"secular, sensuous, even carnal\" Texas blues styles were occurring at least as early as, and likely not as a derivative of performance styles that were occurring in the Mississippi River Delta region.", "score": 0.80776906, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:8bf71ad2-e69b-4496-afe3-3df8f9ceab3c>", "text": "Influenced by Eric Clapton and Peter Green, he became interested in blues music and formed his first band. Shortly after, he played rhythm guitar with Freddie King until his death in 1976. He then recorded and performed with several artists before teaming up with singer/guitarist Bnois King, from Monroe, Louisiana, whose soulful vocals and jazz guitar style contrasted well with Kubek's more obtrusive finger and slide guitar techniques. Kubek, with his substantial arsenal of instruments, effects, and techniques, delivers a blues/rock guitar display that is tempered by the remarkable accompaniment of Bnois King's jazz influenced guitar. Kubek, coming from the Texas blues/rock background after playing with Stevie Ray Vaughan, Albert King, Freddie King, and B.B.

He hardly moves most of his body. He keeps his head in a pretty steady position and he hardly moves his torso (watch his shoulders for this, he hardly does any swaying). Of course the first time I ever saw this recording I was standing on the dance floor at the House of Blues at Disneyland waiting for Bo Diddley to come on stage, and I clearly remember being struck by the way Davis moves his hand up and down the neck. He seems to have extreme familiarity with the guitar and an innate knowledge of just where his fingers need to go. Now this seems to be particularly impressive, because the good reverend went through a whole slew of guitars in his day. He used to play for money in the streets of New York City until one day he fell asleep on the sidewalk and when he woke up \"pretty miss gibson\" was gone. So apparently his virtuosic abilities are applicable to any guitar (including twelve string) which makes his abilities even more impressive.\nThen we've got good old Arthel \"Doc\" Watson.

A product of this multifaceted environment, Billy's unique style can best be described as a synthesis of traditional acoustic and electric blues, rockabilly, roots, and Americana .\nBilly is a story teller and the songs he writes are based upon his own experiences . They are filled with humor and irony, they tell a story of a lifetime of living, loving, and playing,music in Chicago.He often introduces a song by saying \"This is a true story I know I was there!\"\nA well known, and well respected figure around the Chicago music scene Billy has played with and learned from some of the finest musicians in the world. He has established himself as dynamic frontman and exciting stage performer whose presence always involves the audience in his performance.\nA talented musician and a gifted songwriter Billy is at his best with his dobro in his hands performing his own quick witted originals in front of a live audience. His emphasis has always been, and will always be on performing live.\nAs a recording artist Billy has self-produced three records:\" Mean Woman Blues\" which he recorded in Chicago withe the Lonnie Brooks blues band, \"Life Ain't Easy\"with members of the Country Roads Band, and \"Live at Bozley's\" . His songs have appeared on two compilation discs \"Mile by Blues Mile\", and \"Ultimate Blues Volume One\". He has played on numerous recordings as a session player.\n\"My biggest musical influences are in the blues, all the Kings: B.B., Albert, and Freddy,Lightning Hopkins, John Lee Hooker, but also the rockabilly of Dale Hawkins.the rockand roll of Buddy. Holly and the storytelling of Bob Dylan. I used to listen to them when all of my friends were listening to popular music.\nGrowing up in Chicago was an advantage for me because the music is all around you, all the time.

Damien Jurado, for one, has played a huge part in my life as an inspiration for writing songs and making music. It was his first and second albums that taught me everything I know about songwriting.\nMark Kozelek of the Red House Painters and Sun Kil Moon played a big role in my current style, specifically when it comes to finger-picking.

And as cliche and overused as it may be, it would be great to live life and support myself as a full-time musician, so I guess that could always be considered the ultimate goal for Barelands.\nSince I’m fairly new to the Beaumont scene, I’m still trying to learn the different venues and artists that permeate throughout the area.", "score": 0.802994907, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:e81d4f26-8ca5-446f-9e51-6bc19346a627>", "text": "country classic song lyrics are the property of the respective\nartist, authors and labels, they are intended solely for educational\npurposes and private study only.

This record contrasts the possibilities of great blues and the limitations of the conventions that underlie them. Randy Bachman achieves the strata from rock guitarist to jazz practitioner.\n”After decades of painting myself into a musical corner, and trying to reinvent the pop/rock musical wheel,” writes Bachman, “I found myself seeking a way to express myself in broader musical terms. This led me back to my teenage years with Lenny Breau and playing jazz for the first time.”\nJazzThing in depth .\nBachman’s voice is distinguished by its plain statement. Fans of Bachman-Turner Overdrive enjoyed Randy’s vocals in classics like “Lookin’ Out for Number One” and “Blue Collar.” For better or worse, Bachman’s voice has not changed. It remains a straight delivery, unwavered by vibrato or muscular exertion.\nJazzThing features some stellar guitar work. Not surprisingly, that occurs in Bachman’s blues comfort zone on “Breau’s Place (Quiet & Blue).” Bachman and Breau’s deft combination of chords, notes and improvisation make this a prime candidate for song of the record. The back half of “Dead Cool” breaks a sweat of fantastic scaling from Bachman as well as some serious key work by Chris Gestrin. If the writing on the wall says it all, as “In Blue,” Randy sought to relax in jazz.\nJazzThing is an enhanced CD.

Austin was a blues town with a thriving local scene headed by a then little-known Stevie Ray Vaughan. Duarte was among those who took notice of the guitarist. \"I guess you could say he turned my head,\" he understates.\nDuarte spent the 1980s hopping from band to band, alternately playing jazz-fusion and roadhouse blues. As Vaughan's star was rising on a national level, Duarte was one of a handful of Austin guitarists to fill the local void. It was during this period that he really developed his chops. It was also then that he developed a taste for heroin.\n\"I started using in the late eighties, but it wasn't a full blown monster until the early nineties,\" Duarte admits. Unlike many musicians whose bad habits escalate on the road, Duarte actually took to touring in an effort to quell his addiction. \"If you look back to our schedule in '92 and '93, we were touring constantly. A lot of that was just to keep me clean,\" he says. Back home in Austin, clean living was more difficult. \"I didn't even have to leave the house,\" he says. \"All I had to do was pick up the phone and have it delivered to my front door.\"\nDespite his addiction, the early- and mid-nineties marked a period of great success for the guitarist. In 1994, his first album, Texas Sugar/Strat Magik, was released to widespread acclaim. Packed with shuffling Texas blues, the album was a hit among both blues and rock fans. In 1995 he was named Best New Talent in Guitar Player magazine.\n1997 saw the release of Duarte's sophomore album, Tailspin Headwhack. More experimental than its predecessor, Tailspin brought Duarte's love of jazz closer to the fore and featured punk and funk elements as well. Critics loved the album, and its release seemed a sign of good things to come. But it wasn't to be. The album sold well enough by blues standards but failed to meet the success of Texas Sugar/Strat Magik. His label, Silvertone Records, wasted no time in dropping Duarte from its roster.

It stood as the world's tallest building for 40 years, from its completion in 1931 until construction of the World Trade Center's North Tower was completed in 1972. Following the September 11 attacks in 2001, the Empire State Building was again the tallest building in New York (although it was no longer the tallest in the US or the world). The Empire State Building was once again demoted to second-tallest building in New York on April 30, 2012, when the new One World Trade Center reached a greater height. The Empire State Building is currently the third-tallest completed skyscraper in the United States (after the Willis Tower and Trump International Hotel and Tower, both in Chicago), and the 15th-tallest in the world (the tallest now is Burj Khalifa, located in Dubai). It is also the fourth-tallest freestanding structure in the Americas. The Empire State Building is generally thought of as an American cultural icon. It is designed in the distinctive Art Deco style and has been named as one of the Seven Wonders of the Modern World by the American Society of Civil Engineers. The building and its street floor interior are designated landmarks of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, and confirmed by the New York City Board of Estimate. It was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1986. In 2007, it was ranked number one on the List of America's Favorite Architecture according to the AIA.", "score": 0.0006258626947698818, "source": "sparse"}]}

Tall courses that people climb with a rope for protection are called routes, and short courses where you don’t have a rope and don’t go very high are called boulder problems.

But it’s the Waitangi in the Bay of Islands, where the Treaty was signed in 1840, that has a special place in New Zealand’s history.\nThe New Zealand Geographic Board (NZGB), New Zealand’s place naming authority, has been researching the history of the name and came across some interesting discoveries.\nAccording to McKinnon in Place names – the imperial connection, Waitangi was briefly named Victoria after Queen Victoria. However, possibly because of prevailing anti-royalist attitudes at the time, it wasn’t a name that caught on.\nThere are several possible meanings for ‘Waitangi’ – it literally translates as ‘noisy or weeping water.’ Reed’s Place Names of New Zealand notes that the literal meaning of the Waitangi in the Bay of Islands may refer to the noise of Haruru Falls at the mouth of the Waitangi River. Sir Apirana Ngata, who was a member of the former Honorary Geographic Board of New Zealand, believed Waitangi meant ‘wailing waters’ and originated from the people of the first waka who heard voices that they identified as their ancestors farewelling them from across the sea.\nInterestingly, despite its place in New Zealand’s history, Waitangi in the Bay of Islands is not an official place name. Rather, it is a recorded name and is one of many place names in long term and common use that the New Zealand Geographic Board Ngā Pou Taunaha o Aotearoa (NZGB) hasn’t yet dealt with. If anyone would like to play a part in officially naming Waitangi, you can make a proposal to the NZGB.\nNew Zealand place names help us to find where we are and recognise our culture and heritage.

He said,\n'There has been a lot of debate in recent years about place names in New Zealand and more recently over the use of the name Aotearoa for New Zealand. But what’s in a place name?\n'Place-names form an important part of a country’s history and heritage, as well as its culture and language.\n'In New Zealand, most place names have Māori or British origins with names often being used to commemorate notable people, events, places from their homeland, or to describe significant physical characteristics of the surrounding land or sea.\n'Dutch cartographers initially named the islands Nova Zeelandia after the Dutch province of Zeeland. By the time of British exploration, the country's name was anglicised to New Zealand.\n'There was no known pre-European Māori name for New Zealand although commonly, until the early 20th century, Māori from the south referred to the North Island as Aotearoa (commonly translated as 'long white cloud') and in modern Māori usage, this has been popularised as the name for the whole country.\n'Māori had several names for the North and South Islands, including Te Ika-a-Māui (the fish of Māui) for the North Island and Te Waipounamu (the waters of greenstone) and Te Waka o Aoraki (the canoe of Aoraki) for the South Island.\n'The North and South Island names arose through common usage rather than an official declaration and in 2009 it was revealed that they had never been made official. In 2013, alternative names were formalised for the two main islands, as North Island or Te Ika-a-Māui, and South Island or Te Waipounamu, with either the English or Māori name being used or a combination of both.\n'Many Māori place names have either historical or mythological significance. Early Māori explorers such as Kupe, like many later European explorers, named many features after themselves, their family members, events that occurred at the locations, and places from their homelands. For example, the Māori name for Wellington Harbour, Te Whanganui a Tara (the great harbour of Tara), derives from Tara, a grandson of Kupe and ancestor of several local iwi.", "score": 0.842218459, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:2b512afb-515c-4fcc-8f83-92f42c5b25dd>", "text": "Following public consultation, the NZGB recommended to the Minister for Land Information that one name, Waitangitāhuna River, should be made official for both the upper and lower parts of Waitangitaona River.\nThe Minister for Land Information confirmed the NZGB recommendation and made the final determination on 9 November 2018.\nRecorded name Waitangitaona River altered to official name Waitangitāhuna River.\nPublished in the New Zealand Gazette on 20 December 2018.\nA river in two parts flowing generally northwards for approximately 45km from Tatare Range into the Tasman Sea.

Fourth Edition\nby A.W.Reed. Revised by Peter Dowling\nThis guide was initially published in 1950 by Reed Books under the title Maori Place Names and their Meanings. It has had 19 reprints across four editions, each one attempting to provide a more comprehensive guide to Maori place names and pronunciation, and to migrate the use of macrons into the written language to denote long vowel sounds. Revising editor Peter Dowling of Oratia Press includes a short foreword that acknowledges the growth and evolution of the written language over the past 20 years.\nWith over 2300 entries, this digest examines the basic translations and also provides a guide to commonly used words within the place names, such as maunga, puke, roto and wai.\nThis is a book which every New Zealander should own. Since some of the locales’ names have evolved over time to include coastal and marine names – for example Te Tai-o-Marokura – the book’s Fourth Edition is designed to keep readers abreast of the correct references to these places.\nThere is a wealth of information in this edition. For example, what is New Plymouth’s Māori name? How should we pronounce and spell what was formerly Wanganui? The guide explains that preference should prevail, but that the regional pronunciation of ‘wh’ was originally ‘w’, and was subsequently written that way on the historical record. Either spelling or pronunciation can be used officially for the city, but the reader at least has the knowledge as to the difference. What is also interesting about this guide is how deeply entrenched in our language some places names are, and how, in other cases, the transition to their use has been slower to uptake.\nSome entries are accompanied by short anecdotes or historical facts. To round out the guide, illustrations by James Berry are found throughout, as featured in the 1950 edition. Berry was a notable coin and stamp designer, and his excellence in graphic design is evident in this guide.\nAuthor: A.W. Reed.

When, some years later, the missionaries appeared, organized settlement still lay far in the distance. Unhappily, it was not achieved without a grim struggle in which the settlers and loyal natives had to be assisted by contingents of colonists and friendly natives from Hawke's Bay and elsewhere. Fitting it is, therefore, that future generations should be told when and how the great inheritance which they will enjoy was founded.\nThe disparaging name “Poverty Bay” was given by Captain Cook only to the inlet adjacent to Gisborne. Its survival as the designation of the district was due solely to official neglect in the early days to bestow upon it a suitable name. Mr. (later Sir Donald) McLean was, apparently, free from blame. In his reports to the Government, he invariably referred to the district as the “Turanga Plain” or “Turanga,” and to the bay as the “Bay of Turanga.” Perhaps the native name “Turanga” was not officially adopted because it so closely resembles “Tauranga.”\nThat the similarity between these two place-names was apt to occasion confusion, even in official circles, is suggested in a story of an amusing—and, for Poverty Bay, a costly—mistake which is stated to have occurred in 1874. According to the Tauranga Golden Jubilee Souvenir Booklet (1932), requests were made both by Turanga and Tauranga for Government buildings, and Parliament voted £2,400 to provide “a courthouse, gaol and police quarters at Turanga.” On account of a blunder, however, the building was erected at Tauranga! It was of two storeys and was held to be the second largest wooden building in New Zealand.

Those beaches where the founding waka (canoes) landed are of great significance to Māori. There are over 70 revered landing places – known as ngā ūnga waka. According to tradition, some beaches still bear the marks of the landing – such as Moeraki Beach, on the South Island’s east coast, where the giant round boulders are said to be the petrified remains of the kūmara and gourds that scattered when the Ārai-te-uru capsized.\nPākehā too arrived on the beach, and some of their landing points have been commemorated. These include several of James Cook’s beaches, such as Ship Cove in the Marlborough Sounds and Cook’s Cove near Tolaga Bay. Later arrivals are remembered at Petone Beach on Wellington Harbour, where the first New Zealand Company settlers landed.\nKaiti Beach, in Gisborne, has the distinction of being a place where both Māori and Pākehā landed. The Horouta and Ikaroa-a-Rauru canoes are said to have landed here. Generations later, in October 1769, this was the first place Captain Cook and his men set foot in New Zealand. Today, an obelisk marks the spot.\nOnce people settled, the beach remained a significant place of travel. Māori found inland routes difficult – the country was often mountainous or swampy – while out at sea the waters were rough. So in some places, such as the North Island’s west coast, the beach made for easy travel. That shoreline was referred to as ‘te ara one a Hine-tuakirikiri’ (the sandy path of the sand maid). Te Rauparaha (a Ngāti Toa chief) led the famous migration of Ngāti Toa (Te Heke Tātaramoa) in 1822 along the beach from Taranaki southwards to Pukerua Bay.\nPākehā also used the beach for travel, walking, and more often, riding on horseback.

For most of the time, Māori lived not in fortified pa, but in unprotected settlements or seasonal camps.\nThe greatest achievements of Māori material culture were carving wood for important buildings and canoes, and fashioning stone into tools and ornaments. Warfare did not inhibit regular trade in desirable stones and foods, and was itself a means by which resources were appropriated.\nIn 1642, Dutch explorer Abel Tasman made the first confirmed European discovery of New Zealand.

This was done by people working in pairs from either side, using the rich yellow strands of pīngao, white bleached or black-dyed kiekie, and sometimes harakeke, to create a range of intricate and artistic patterns. Stitches were combined to form a variety of patterns. Groups of single stitches created patterns such as tapuae kautuku, waewae pakura, whakarua kopito and papakirango. Some of the traditional cross stitched patterns are poutama, waharua, purapura whetu or mangaroa, kaokao, pātikitiki, roimata toroa and niho taniwha.

This is on purpose. Darjeeling tea producers have gone to great pains to emphasize harvest time and estate. Differences between flushes can be fairly easily recognized. Color, intensity of aroma, and texture vary noticeably.\nWhat remains is a question of distinctiveness among estates. Does Margaret’s Hope really differ from Okayti?\nHere are things to consider when comparing darjeeling teas:\n1. Location. There are approximately 86 different tea estates in the Darjeeling region. These are the gardens that can legally be called darjeeling teas according to the Darjeeling Planter’s Association. Approximately 47,000 acres of gardens annually produce about 22 million lbs of tea.\nThese gardens grow on slopes and hillsides; therefore they vary in terms of elevation. Some are close to 1,000 feet above sea level, but can be as much as 7,500. Most grow above 3,300 feet.\n2. Types of tea bushes. The real key to distinctiveness among estates is the mix of plants they are growing. They can grow China bush clones. They can grow Assams, or China-Assam hybrids. These hybrids get designations like: AV2, B157, P312, T78, and TS378. Clones and hybrids carry their own strengths. Some are sweeter tasting. Some are hardier bushes. Some have longer or more productive lifespans. And any single estate can have a combination of hybrids growing on it. In effect, each estate can have its own recipe of leaves harvested from one or more clonal/hybrids. And this recipe can change over time. As some bushes approach the end of their lifespans they will be replaced by younger versions of themselves or a different hybrid. When you include the climatic variations that occur, you may be left wondering how different a darjeeling tea from the same estate may have tasted 50 years ago.\nThe true beauty of Darjeeling teas then, is both the static and the fluid. It is the combination that creates each distinct story. That makes it difficult to say which is better. But with a little digging and investigation, you can find which estates have greater populations of sweeter China bush or other characteristics you may seek.\nWalker Tea Review- a tea blog with tea reviews and tea tastings.\nWant to see a tea reviewed?

There’s a Darjeeling tea crisis coming.\nSince June this year, Darjeeling has been under a ‘Bandh’ [general strike] due to the Gorkhaland political unrest. Some 100,000 workers in affected tea gardens have hence halted work, resulting in one of the worst seasons ever for the so-called Champagne of teas – Darjeeling.\nProduction has been so severely hit that only an equivalent third of last year’s mammoth 8.32 million kg crop has been harvested, despite an increase in global demand, yet this may only be the beginning of the effects on the Darjeeling tea industry.\nIf teas aren’t being picked, the Camelia sinensis plants will start growing into trees which then require extensive time and effort to reduce to their optimum height. Once weeds become rampant, production lines are no longer maintained, and buyer confidence falls, there is a fear that some Darjeeling tea gardens will fall into permanent disuse.\nSo far this year, only the first flush has been harvested, missing the most popular and lucrative second flush.\nMany local families are dependent on the Darjeeling tea estates for their income, and so I cannot guess the catastrophic impact this must have on them. I’m not knowledgeable enough on the politics of the region to offer comment on the conflict, and feel it would be disrespectful to do so. However, from a tea-growing perspective, even if the conflict is resolved quickly, it’s going to take many years for the tea gardens to get back to full production – if they even all survive.\nIn the meantime, grab your Darjeeling while you still can, but take care that it *is* actually Darjeeling you’re getting. There’s a joke in the tea world that there is twice as much Darjeeling on the global market than is grown in Darjeeling. This is despite protection by the ‘Geographical Indication’ legislation, which regions like Champagne also enjoy.\nHence, you should always buy from reputable suppliers like the Bari Tea Brewery.\nDarjeeling is often referred to as the Champagne of the tea world – but like wines, a good sparkling white wine is better than a bad Champagne.

Grown at 7000 feet above sea level, some say it is a bit closer to heaven, but Darjeeling tea is considered the most expensive and most exclusive of the teas. Why is that when Darjeeling is simply a black tea that can be considered an oolong? Confused? Let’s try to go back in history a bit;\nDarjeeling was first planted in 1841 by a civil surgeon of the Indian Medical Service. His name was Dr. Campbell. He was practicing medicine in the Indian District of Darjeeling. He had obtained tea seeds from China. Dr. Campbell planted the tea seeds only as an experiment. By 1850 Darjeeling went commercial.\nDarjeeling became wildly popular, the UK embraced this tea above all others at the time. When the Tea Board of India was created, Darjeeling became an exclusive tea. This rendered the tea extra special. It carried the certification and the logos of the tea board. What does exclusivity really mean? It means that Darjeeling cannot be otherwise grown, or manufactured anywhere else in the entire world but there in the foothills of the Indian District of Darjeeling and the Himalayan Mountains.\nThe superior quality has been made by classification, flush time, and grade. This Indian black tea has maintained this superior quality by its consistent regulation and overseeing of the growth, harvest and manufacture of the tea.\nWhen a tea estate speaks about flush time, they are referring to the harvest seasons of the tea. They are called flushes. The new growth of a tea plant consists of full leaves. It takes approximately forty days for a new bud to blossom into a flush.\nThe first flush is in early spring about mid-March. This harvest time produces a gentle light in color tea with mild tannin. These first picked teas are much more delicate than the second flush.\nThe second flush is a summer harvest. The month of June is when the tea has had much more time to mature. At this pick the tea will be much fuller in flavor almost “musky”.", "score": 0.008381225512299625, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:06c25d33-f887-463c-a2dd-e562157c3e2a>", "text": "The Okayti Tea Estate is a tea garden in the Darjeeling district in the Indian state of West Bengal, it is credited to having one of the oldest tea factories in the region, dating back to 1888.

Tea’s arrival in this part of India by smuggling in the 1800s would have a tremendous impact on global tea trade and global trade in general.\nThe popularly held belief that the fresh air of high, mountainous elevations was beneficial to one’s health—particularly at a time when cholera ran rampant through the lowlands—led to the establishment of a sanitarium in Darjeeling in the early 1800s.

In one of the most significant moments in agricultural espionage history, a Scottish botanist named, perfectly, Robert Fortune was dispatched to the interior of China (at times in Chinese disguise) to source both tea plants and experts alike, with the goal of creating viable tea agriculture in Darjeeling. It worked. The eventual highly successful propagation of tea in this region would alter trade relations with China and Britain—and the rest of the world—for generations.\nClassified as black tea but now often processed closer to an oolong style, Darjeeling teas can encompass a range of tea varieties and be fired to different degrees, and even more confusingly—and consistent with its cloak-and-dagger history—are prone to being counterfeited.", "score": 0.0012394244843082101, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:25b6f09e-a690-4ebb-a60d-e8fe2bdea686>", "text": "Where: Tribal fairs and New Market shops\nAverage Cost: Rs 100 for jute and bamboo products and Rs 20 to Rs 50 for putuls\n10.

Below are some simple actions that can go on to save your life.\n- Evacuate the area immediately\nRegardless of the type of flooding, you should always get anyone that has no business being near the area as far away from the flood as possible. This includes children, the sick and elderly as well as pets.\nIn case of minimal flooding like in the case of drainage failure, getting these groups of people and pets away from the home will create a conducive environment to deal with the flood without having to worry about their safety. In case of weather-related flooding, then everyone needs to evacuate immediately to prevent drowning which can be very easy with raging waters.\n- Switch off the main power switch\nPower outages often accompany weather related flooding events. In case the flooding is not as a result of heavy downpour, you should switch off main power switches around the house to prevent electrocution. Some electric appliances have connecting sockets that are at near-ground level and flood water can easily rise to that level, causing even more danger. Just to be safe, put on some protective gear such as rubber boots and rubber gloves and switch off all power sources.\n- Get household items off the floor\nSalvaging as many of your household items as possible should be on your list of priorities, especially if the flood is not weather related. Flooding from rain water can become catastrophic quickly, so you should be very careful before attempting to save anything in case the flood is too fast. Getting as much of your household items off ground level will help keep them dry and safe from water damage.\n- Wear protective gear\nFlood water is not always clean water, in fact, it’s rarely ever clean. This is why when it floods, waterborne diseases often rear their ugly heads and spread like wildfire. In order to protect yourself from these kinds of opportunistic diseases that are transported by pathogens that are found in water, you need to wear protective gear.

AmFam Team\nA landslide can displace tons of soil and earth and can result in serious structural problems to your home. And when your big investments are on the line, it’s important to know mudflow can be covered by your standard homeowners policy. So, how does homeowners insurance cover landslides, mudflows, earthquakes and geophysical events? Short answer: it depends. Although most insurance groups don’t offer mudslide insurance, your home may be covered if the event was the result of an earthquake and you have supplemental earthquake insurance on your homeowners policy.\nAccording to the US Geological Survey, landslides cause an average of $3 billion dollars in damage annually. Landslide insurance coverage isn’t typically offered because insurance companies consider mudflow of this type as an uncovered “earth movement.” And flood insurance usually doesn’t carry a landslide insurance rider either, even if many mudflow events are caused by excessive rain and flooding.\nYou may be able to find a form of landslide insurance coverage when damage results from a covered earthquake event. As hard as this may be to contemplate, if your home is damaged (or worse) from an earthquake and you have active supplemental earthquake insurance added onto your homeowners policy, you can be protected with this type of coverage.\nNatural forces are usually at work when a landslide occurs. If your area is prone to large amounts of water flow like flash floods, swelling rivers or snowmelt, you should make a mudslide safety plan to safely evacuate if a geophysical event were to occur near you. Erosion and loss of supporting soil can destabilize an area and make it prone to movement. Because volcanic events and earthquakes can also shake foundations and leave parcels of land vulnerable to landslides, landslide safety (Opens in a new tab) has never been more important.\nTake a look at our advice on what to do in areas prone to mudslides:\nBuild away from ridges. By avoiding construction of your home in areas prone to geophysical movement, you can protect against losses that result in landslides. Steer away from building on steep ridges and slopes. Mountain edges, drainage areas and parcels of land where natural erosion occurs are also to be avoided.\nEducate yourself before you buy. Review geophysical events that have occurred in the area you’re planning on building.

On occasion, the mudflows have reached the sea in Puget Sound over 40 miles away. One lahar, the Osceola Mudflow, covered more than 200 square miles of lowland. This event 5,600 years ago reshaped the mountain; calculations suggest that 2,000 feet of material was removed from the top of the mountain. Prior to the Osceloa eruption, Rainier’s peak is thought to have been over 16,000 feet.\nRainier’s massive mudflows are not necessarily linked directly to a volcanic eruption. About 600 years ago, a slope failure on Rainier’s west flank triggered a large mudflow that reached Puget Sound near the village of Electron. Today the USGS estimates that 150,000 people live on the debris fields from Rainier’s lahar’s.

I will consider the staging of unequal power relations in both the execution and the representation of the sacrifice ritual by tracing the various ways sacrificial violence expresses subjectivity. In recognizing these manifestations of power, we — who have the cognitive faculties, cultural determinations, and social agencies that enable us to perform violence, to abstain from it, and to contemplate it — refine our capacity to understand violence toward other animals (including other members of our own species), and the ways it shapes us within ecological networks, so that we can become better, or at least more self-aware, actors in our ecological communities.\nWhile this exploration of subjectivities generated through violence against the animal speaks to questions of ecological orientation that are important everywhere in the world, I frame these questions with a discussion about the recognition of victims’ otherness and hardship during the Lapindo mudflow in East Java. The mudflow is an ongoing ecological disaster that resists being fixed down to any agreed-upon narrative. Disputes over causes, effects, compensation, and institutional responses unsettle understandings of the event, as various individuals and institutions represent and become represented in different politicized narratives. Each of these representations weave, and are woven with, arrangements of power. As political and economic elites seek to protect their power and interests during the crisis, they often resort to denying the rights and status of mudflow victims, a denial that echoes the dehumanizing objectification of the other that is expressed in animal sacrifice.", "score": 1.6376671424663582e-05, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:7763daf9-16ee-4758-b18f-d46000cef8b4>", "text": "The following types of natural hazards are identified in the project area, which should be analyzed when performing a natural disaster risk assessment:\ndanger of development of slope processes (landslides, landslides with landslips, etc.);\nflood hazard (during snowmelt, extreme precipitation, lakes outburst);\nunderflood hazard; and\nThe climatic conditions of Tajikistan play a very important role in the development of natural disasters in the country.

Labels not only act as a tool to beautify products, they also inform consumers about various components and legality of the product. The importance of labelling increases when it comes to products such as liquor that is under the direct jurisdiction of Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau or TTB of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. According to the guidelines of TTB, liquor labels need to contain information quintessential for awareness and knowledge of consumers. In this article, we discuss the details that need to be included in the liquor labels. Let’s begin.\nThe brand name, used by manufacturers or importers of alcoholic beverages to market their product, is the most well-crafted and created information that a liquor label highlights. As per the TTB, brand name must not mislead or confuse consumers regarding the identity, origin or any other characteristic of alcoholic beverages.\nName and Address of the Importer or Bottler\nLiquor label needs to mention the name and address of the importer or bottler of alcoholic drinks. Importers are authorized to mention the principal place of business instead the place where bottling of the liquor originally took place. Importers are also authorized to use their trade name instead of operating name.\nLiquor beverages are largely differentiated on the basis of alcoholic content present in it. Thus, it is the responsibility of liquor drink bottler to mention the degree of alcohol content in the drink. The volume of alcohol content is expressed in percentage on the liquor label. The net content of liquor needs to be mentioned in metric units of measure such as L or ml.\nStatement of Health Warning\nA health warning needs to be mentioned on liquor labels of the beverages that contain more than 0.5% alcoholic content. With health warnings, responsibilities such as ‘Don’t Drink and Drive’ need to be also published.\nCountry of Origin\nAs per the regulations of TTB and the United States Customs and Border Protection laws, the country of origin of alcoholic beverages needs to be mentioned on the label of the bottle or can of the alcoholic beverage. Country of origin is mentioned in the form of ‘Produced in’ or ‘Product of’.\nType or Class of Alcoholic Drink\nThe liquor label needs to clearly state the type or class of the alcoholic drink.", "score": 0.859908223, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:c2ce1fe0-de4a-4d19-8ca9-ad3adf448650>", "text": "The TTB proposed several new rules and solicited input under a proposal titled “Modernization of the Labeling and Advertising Regulations for Wine, Distilled Spirits, and Malt Beverages” last year.

Yes Gin can now officially be aged. In addition they removed the line about Gin having to be aged in paraffin lined barrels. Whiskey Specialties class type 641 products should now be allowed to carry an age statement.\n-One proposal was to define the size of an oak barrel used for aging. This was the most commented on item and the comments overwhelmingly opposed this proposal. The TTB listened and the current code, which does not specify a particular size, will remain in place.\n-Another proposal would have limited age statements to only time spent in the first barrel. This was not implemented. The TTB agrees all time spent in barrels count towards the age statement. However no changes were made to 27 CFR 5.22 which states age for bourbon whisky, rye whisky, wheat whisky, malt whisky, or rye malt whisky, and straight whiskies other than straight corn whisky, means the period the whisky has been stored in charred new oak containers. This also does not affect the current requirement in certain whiskies to disclose if it was aged in used cooperage.\n-Agave Spirits is now a new Class with 2 defined types listed under it, Tequila & Mezcal. US producers making Agave spirits in this Class will now be able to do so without submitting a formula\n-Brand labels on spirits. Before the brand name with class and type were required to appear together on a label. Now that information just needs to be able to be viewed all at once.\n-If whisky is aged in more than one barrel, the label may optionally indicate what types of barrels were used.\n-If spirits are labeled with a term describing how many times it has been distilled it must be a truthful statement.

For example, a label submitted to TTB often entails a lot of back and forth between the agency and the applicant, as well as corrections made to the label, before an approval is obtained.\nThe Federal Alcohol Administration Act authorizes TTB to enact labeling regulations for two purposes. First, as a means to provide consumers with adequate product information; secondly, to prevent consumer deception. The TTB often refuses to approve labels that cut against either regulation. Given that the terms are not clearly defined, the process is not without problems.\nImporters of beer, wine and distilled spirits need to apply for a Certificate of Label Approval (COLA), on their federal basic importer’s permit, and the COLA must be obtained prior to importation of any product into the United States.\nWineries and Distilleries, if bottling the product themselves, are required to have a COLA, prior to bottling any product.", "score": 0.10450344385673833, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:2377e427-7cbc-499b-924c-bbbf8abb790a>", "text": "December 20, 2010\nContact: (202) 835-3323, firstname.lastname@example.org\nWashington, DC--The National Consumers League (NCL) has once again called on the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) to issue a final rule to improve alcohol beverage labeling.\n“The drinking public needs certain basic information on beer, wine, and spirits labels,” said NCL Executive Director Sally Greenberg. “With a severe nationwide obesity epidemic, there is no excuse for not having calories listed on all alcohol beverage labels. Consumers also need clear information about alcohol content in order to drink responsibly.”\nSeven years ago, the National Consumers League petitioned TTB to require an “Alcohol Facts” panel on labels of beer, wine, and distilled spirits. More than 3 years ago, TTB proposed a watered-down version of “Alcohol Facts,” which it called “Serving Facts,” but has still not issued a final rule.\n“The Alcohol Facts panel was intended to provide all the information consumers need in one location, clearly and concisely,” said Greenberg. “It would be like the Nutrition Facts panel on food labels, except that it would provide the information relevant to alcoholic beverages.” NCL asked that the “Alcohol Facts” panel include serving size, the number of calories per serving, alcohol content information (including the amount of alcohol per serving, the definition of a “standard drink,” and the number of standard drinks per container), and ingredient information.\n“The nine college students who went to an emergency room for alcohol poisoning after drinking too much of a caffeinated alcoholic beverage earlier this year may not have realized just how much alcohol they were consuming,” added Greenberg. “Maybe if the standard drinks per container had been required to appear on the labels, they wouldn’t have made that mistake.”\nTTB’s inaction on Alcohol Facts labeling is also interfering with other important public health objectives. A new law requires nutrition labeling of foods and beverages served in chain restaurants and bars, including alcoholic beverages, but there is no approved method for measuring certain nutrients in alcohol and TTB has provided the industry with no guidance. If the Alcohol Facts panel were required, restaurants and bars could simply use the information on the product label.\nThe lack of calorie and alcohol information on beer, wine, and spirits labels is also an obstacle to application of the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.", "score": 0.06095933645707939, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:1698ed4d-9dc5-4069-84ed-cd02380bdfb2>", "text": "~Anyway, the wine industry and its promo hacks spoke loud and clear about the product’s food value, so loud that they once again awakened the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) and other such oxymoronically-named organizations.\n~In its infinite desire to make sure that all Americans think and live the way its zealot founder does, CSPI has petitioned the federal government to mandate that wine labels come with nutritional information on them, like all other food labels.\n~You would think there are two problems with the nutritional label idea:\nFirst, if, as the government and CSPI have tried to make us believe in the past, wine is not food, why should it contain nutritional information?\nSecond, the FDA does not regulate wine labels, the Federal Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau does (TTB).\nSince TTB doesn't regulate food it hasn't required nutritional labels.\n~The solutions to the two problems:\nCSPI cries UNCLE! OK, the moralists say, wine is food, now put its nutritional value on the label.\nThe federal government all of a sudden seems to think that wine is food.

Retailers sued TTB and a preliminary injunction was issued by the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio on December 14, 2010, preventing TTB from enforcing its ruling while the case remains pending . As of March 2012 this court case was still pending. At the state level, New Hampshire's State Supreme Court ruled that by offering cigarette rolling machines, retailers would be classified as cigarette manufacturers and as a result would be subject to the Master Settlement Agreement, and be required to submit payments to the state for each cigarette that is produced . Additionally, in March 2011, Arkansas enacted a law to prohibit licensed tobacco retailers from possessing or otherwise utilizing a cigarette rolling machine . Also, the Wisconsin Department of Revenue issued a notice in September 2011 that ruled that retailers that offer cigarette rolling machines are classified as manufactures, and considers the final product to be a manufactured cigarette subject to cigarette excise taxes .\nSelling pipe tobacco for RYO use avoids other laws and regulations as well. For example, the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking (PACT) Act of 2009 prohibits the U.S. Postal Service from shipping cigarettes, RYO, and smokeless tobacco, but does not prohibit shipping pipe tobacco . This allows internet sites to continue to sell and ship pipe tobacco marketed for RYO use. Further, the PACT Act requires sellers to report on quantities of cigarettes, RYO, and smokeless tobacco shipped to each state and tax administrators use this information to ensure all state taxes have been paid. There is no such reporting requirement on sales of pipe tobacco.\nAdditionally, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (Tobacco Control Act) prohibits candy-flavored cigarettes and RYO, but does not prohibit flavorings in pipe tobacco . Brands of pipe tobacco sold for RYO use come in blackberry, black cherry, and vanilla flavors . The Tobacco Control Act also prohibits the use of the descriptors “light,\" “mild,\" or “low,\" or similar descriptors in tobacco product labeling or advertising .

While there I had the opportunity to attend a few of the featured sessions on space-time geography. This special series, with concurrent sessions that ran for most of the conference, addressed salient research questions and issues when dealing with dynamic geographic systems. There is a large and rapidly expanding literature on this topic, and a long mathematical tradition for modeling space-time systems. What is novel about the contribution of geographers to this problem is their emerging synthesis that addresses the many facets of space-time dynamics, from semantics and ontology (how we think about the system), to representation of space-time objects and space-time fields (how they move, morph and change) to the statistical and mathematical modeling of time-dynamic geographic systems. A lot of this is really nifty stuff, and you may want to visit www.AAG.org to take a peek at the abstracts.\nI’ve been thinking about different aspects of space-time, and attending this meeting prompted me to pen this blog on the temporal and spatio-temporal extensions of what is known as the “modifiable areal unit problem”, called MAUP for short. MAUP arises when a summary statistic (for example) is calculated at one geographic scale (say counties), but the value of the summary statistic changes when it is calculated at a different geographic scale (say zip codes). Consider, for example, that the variance of an estimate usually increases as the sample size decreases. Since smaller areas often comprise smaller sample sizes (e.g. households), the variance of an estimate (say household income) is usually larger when calculated for smaller areas. And because variance and covariance enter into the calculation of the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, measures of association may change quite dramatically when calculated for two variables at different spatial scales. The literature on MAUP is extensive; when I searched “Modifiable Areal Unit Problem” on Google 56,700 hits were returned.\nWhat about MTUP? I then searched for “Modifiable Temporal Unit Problem” and zero hits were returned – hopefully this blog entry will change that! The modifiable temporal unit problem is something we have observed in practice in our research at BioMedware and when using SpaceStat to analyze time-dynamic geographic data.", "score": 0.03640699173401958, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:2c14244d-9eab-42e8-9a0d-a5d6966d8e0c>", "text": "Zen Meditation Perth\n1 hr class per week\nSuited to all levels of experience, from beginners to those with an established practice and understanding.\nThis Zen Meditation Perth class includes brief talks on different aspects of Zen & contemplative teaching and mindfulness awareness.\nThe brief talks are combined with stories from Zen and other traditions, including from Meath’s rich history of practice.\nMeath provides instructions explaining how to practice Zen Meditation.\nThe class encompasses one or more 20 min silent breath meditation sits, providing an opportunity to put the instruction into practice.\nThis class commonly includes a Q&A opportunity.\nA general understanding of the Zen Buddhist school of meditation and the fundamental concepts behind it.\nThe ability to confidently and regularly meditate in that breath-style of Zen meditation.\nMany who take up the regular practice of Zen meditation may find it helps with general healing, stress-relief, a growing sense of inner peace and stability, equanimity, compassion and increased selflessness.\nMeath additionally offers a weekly newsletter to session attendees to support them with their practice.\nIn addition, there is also an opportunity to join regular silent one-day Zen Meditation retreats, in which Zen training is reviewed and deepened.\nMeath Conlan’s main focus of teaching is based on the teachings of independent Zen Master Ama Samy within the spiritual community known as Bodhi Sangha.\nMeath has been engaged in contemplative and meditation practices in Christian and Buddhist traditions since the 1970’s.\nZen Meditation Perth – Session Details\n|Location :||Mindfulness Meditation Hub, First Floor, 443 Vincent St West, West Leederville (Google Map)|\n|Session Fee :||Pay What Your Heart Feels|\n|Booking :||No booking required.|\nPlease arrive before the start of the session.\nContact us if you have questions or if you prefer to let us know that you will be attending the session.\n|What to bring :||Yourself, friends, family, partners, work colleagues – all are welcome!|\nComfortable clothing is recommended to assist you in relaxing.\nMats, cushions & blankets are provided.

In other words, if the product is perishable, therefore when there is change in price, it won’t affect the quantity supplied. Hence, the supply is inelastic\nFor example: fruits, it is because fruits are perishable.\nThe second determinant is the time. There are two time of time which are the short run and the long run. In the short run, the supply will be inelastic. It’s because, the supplier can’t increase the supply of a product immediately due to a change in price. Where by in the long run, suppliers are able to increase their product, because they have more time to produce more. And therefore the supply is elastic.\nFor example: in the short run, the price of the laptop increase in the market price. However, the supplier of laptop cant increase their supply immediately due to a short run.\nIn the long run, the supplier have more time to produce more laptop due to more time to produce laptop.\nBusinesses can use price elasticity to decide on their pricing strategy.\nBy using the price elasticity, they can know whether the goods that they are selling is elastic or inelastic. If the good that they are selling is inelastic, for example: necessities, therefore they can set a higher price. It is because if the good is inelastic, the change in price won’t effect the change in demand. In other words, consumers are not that responsive due to a change in price.\nAnd if the good is elastic, such as luxuries goods or goods that have several substitutes, therefore the supplier can’t set a high price. It is because the price is elastic, in other words the consumers are responsive due to a change in price of the good.\nThat’s how the business use the elasticity concept to decide the pricing strategy.\nSupply of a product will increases caused by the technology are getting more advance. As technology has increases, therefore to produce a good will be easier and faster, hence to higher supply of that particular product.\nFor example: a textile company used to produce their goods by manually (by human or workers) and they manage to produce 100pcs of the good per month.", "score": 0.833931208, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:2f8280da-6d76-4a9d-83c3-7f56fa89ea23>", "text": "Price elasticity of supply measures the relationship between change in quantity supplied with a change in price. If supply is elastic (greater than 1), then producers can increase output without a rise in cost or a time delay. If supply is inelastic (less than 1) then producers find it difficult to change production in a given time period.\nJust as there are factors that can impact elasticity of demand, there are also factors that can influence elasticity of supply. They are:\n1) Excess production capacity. If a firm has extra production capacity, then it can increase output without an increase in costs. In this case, supply will be elastic in response to a change in demand.\n2) Inventory of finished products. If there are high levels of raw materials and finished products then the firm will be able to respond to a change in demand. If this occurs, it would indicate that demand is elastic. The opposite is true. If there is a shortage, then prices will increase.\n3) If the cost of a substitute factor is manageable, then the elasticity of supply is higher compared to if no substitution exists. For example, if a bottling plant switches production from soda to beer.\n4) Time. The longer the time period a business has to adjust its production level, the more elastic supply is. The longer the adjustment period, the more able producers are to adapt to a price change. The ability to increase quantity supplied in response to a higher price differs across industries. The response time is slower is industries such as oil and electricity (inelastic) than compared to home remodeling or being a food vendor (elastic).\nBelow is the midpoint formula for calculating the elasticity of supply. You may notice that it looks similar to the midpoint formula for calculating elasticity of demand.\nTo sum up the concept of elasticity, elasticity measures the willingness and ability of buyers and sellers to alter their behavior in response to changes in their economic circumstances.\nApplication of Economics: Elasticity and the War on Drugs\nIn the United States over the past few decades, there has been an ongoing “war” against the use of recreational drugs.

Of course though being on the upper end of the price range is usually the most profitable and should be sought after to attain. But what are the effects of price elasticity if you are go below or above the range?\nIf you go above the range, demand will start to be noticeably lower. In some rare cases where supply isn’t enough to meet demand, this would prove to be more profitable. This is because prices must go up if there isn’t enough supply to meet demand.\nIf you go below the range, demand will rise exponentially, which is a key way to maintain market share. In very common circumstances where there is a recession with an oversupply of shoes for the demand, stealing other company’s market share is a way of survival.\nAlthough the price of your shoe does have affect on the industry, the great industry trends won’t usually be affected by what you decide I’ve seen companies fret they have gone below or above the price elasticity range and are concerned of what negative effects can occur by going against the norm. These negative effects include diminished market share with increased prices, or a furthered recession with decreased prices.\nIn essence, every year a new price elasticity range will be created due to the collective industry forces that control the market.

So let’s start here.\nWhat causes an economic bubble? What causes an economic bubble to pop? In general, there is only one thing that causes an economic bubble: When assets are overvalued and prices are driven up unreasonably by speculation. Likewise, in general, there is only one thing that causes a bubble to pop: When people realize assets are overvalued and panic and thus there is more supply than demand. This is what happened in 2001 and 2007. The specifics are very complex, the gist isn’t. Shares of eToys, ENRON, and tranche products made up of NINA loans all turned out to be nearly worthless in reality. It was euphoric mania, cherry picked data, and speculation that drove their prices, not real metrics on earnings per-share or anything. In words, bubbles require “hot air”, a real successful company might be overvalued and lose an investor money, but it isn’t likely to be at the core of a bubble popping.

There are actually two laws: One law of supply, and one law of demand. Supply and demand may be interrelated, but when you look at the laws you are looking from two different viewpoints. One as the consumer and one as the supplier.\nIf you sell a product that is in high demand, you can sell it for a higher price and will not see a decline in sales. The higher you go in price, the more demand will drop off, until it drops off a cliff (i.e. no sales). You will want to price where you make the most overall profit, which will be some mathematical formula where profit per item times units sold will be the greatest amount. For some items, a small change in price will eliminate sales; for others it takes a large change in price for sales to drop off. This difference is called the elacticity of demand.\nIf you are the purchaser or consumer of an item, supply will tend to drive your price. The more different vendors you can buy from, the greater the supply of an item, or your ability to substitute another item will give you leverage to get a better price.\nAs a reseller of an item, your best bet is to buy an item in plentiful supply to you that is in great demand in the marketplace; so much so it outpaces the retail supply. If it is difficult for other businesses to enter this market and sell to the consumer, it is better for businesses already servicing the market. If you can be in a market where all of these things happen, you’ll have a perfect storm that will create a whirlwind of profit.

In this paper, using a quarterly multi-country econometric model, we first show that a fall in oil prices tends relatively quickly to lower interest rates and inflation in most countries, and increase global real equity prices. The effects on real output are positive, although they take longer to materialize (around 4 quarters after the shock). We then re-examine the effects of low oil prices on the US economy over different sub-periods using monthly observations on real oil prices, real equity prices and real dividends. We confirm the perverse positive relationship between oil and equity prices over the period since the 2008 financial crisis highlighted in the recent literature, but show that this relationship has been unstable when considered over the longer time period of 1946-2016. In contrast, we find a stable negative relationship between oil prices and real dividends which we argue is a better proxy for economic activity (as compared to equity prices). On the supply side, the effects of lower oil prices differ widely across the different oil producers, and could be perverse initially, as some of the major oil producers try to compensate their loss of revenues by raising production. Taking demand and supply adjustments to oil price changes as a whole, we conclude that oil markets equilibrate but rather slowly, with large episodic swings between low and high oil prices.\nKeywords: Oil prices, equity prices, dividends, economic growth, oil supply, global oil markets, and international business cycle.\nJEL Classification: C32, E17, E32, F44, F47, O51, Q43.\nSuggested Citation: Suggested Citation", "score": 0.0539626397301713, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:f0755583-4597-40da-8420-c51f9c211b4c>", "text": "Saturday, September 26, 2009 CE\nThe oil price reached a peak in July of 2008. As the financial markets collapsed and a severe recession established itself, the demand for oil decreased globally. This happened as a consequence of generalized diminished economic activity. As a result of this, the oil price decreased significantly reaching levels not seen in many years. Gasoline prices, natural gas and coal also decreased accordingly since they also are used to power economic activity. During 2009, the energy prices have increased steadily. News related to an economic recovery usually are associated with increases in oil prices. News related to the persistence of the recession such as the unemployment rate and the bank failures are associeted with decreases in oil prices. It is important to point out that the current oil price almost doubles the value at the start of the year, taking into account that the world economy has not fully recovered.\nAccording to the information available, the oil prices depend on the following:\na.- The relationship between its supply and demand.\nb.- Market speculators since the commodity can be traded easily.\nc.- The purchasing capacity of the dollar.\nThe relationship between supply and demand seems to show a pattern of inability of supply to keep up with demand. This was clearly visible in the easily available charts of IEA and other entities. In the years leading to 2007, in the midst of global economic growth, the supply side of the equation was not able to keep up with demand increases, the consequence were price increases.\nMarket speculators probably helped pushing the price up, specially after the first signs of financial collapse when the cash available from the fleeing the financial sector was used to appreciate the value of commodities.\nThe purchasing capacity of the dollar has been diminishing progressively as more dollars need to be printed to cover the financial deficit. If we compare the value of oil with respect to gold, its increase has not been as steep.\nWhat we are probably going to see in the future is an oil price that will increase and decrease based on the overall economic activity since the supply side is under too much stress. High oil prices will slow down economic growth and limit recovery attempts. Speculation will remain a player, making the swings in the oil price steeper than expected from regular supply/demand curves. The value of the dollar will continue to decrease and, as a result of that the oil price will have a trend towards always higher.

Although this sequence does not necessarily imply a causal link, the collapse in land prices is clearly of central importance to recent Asian financial crises, especially in Japan, Indonesia and Thailand (Mera and Renaud, 2000). If banking systems in these countries had not been damaged by the speculative boom in land markets followed by the collapse of land prices, these foreign exchange crises would have been less devastating, and economic recovery in Japan, for example, would have occurred more quickly. The conceptual framework developed in this paper can be used to interpret recent examples of the land price booms and busts leading local business cycles.\nOn the regulatory front, the model developed in this paper explains how the amplitudes of cycles, and the relationship between cycles and speculation, are affected by the elasticity of supply of real estate.

This gives an equilibrium interest rate which is positively correlated with GDP. The intersection of the money market (LM Curve) and goods market (IS Curve); when they both use the same equilibrium interest rate (or exchange rate depending on the type of economy) is general equilibrium. From this relationship, we can derive aggregate demand.\nAggregate demand is the relationship between the price level and the real GDP of an economy at a given time. This general equilibrium can be thought of as a long run macroeconomic equilibrium when the economy is at full employment. A shock to this economy would cause a change in either the IS or LM curve and then result in a change in the aggregate demand function. The economy initially moves to a short run macroeconomic equilibrium defined by the property of an inability for the price level to adjust. Afterwards, long run macroeconomic equilibrium is achieved when price levels adjust which is reflected by a shift of the LM curve causing a return to full employment.\nMacroeconomic equilibrium has two conditions. The first is that the desired aggregate expenditure is equal to actual GDP. This simply means that households are willing to purchase what is being produced (aggregate demand). The second condition is that firms must want to produce the current level of GDP (aggeregate supply). The conditions are fulfilled when both curves intersect.\nIf price levels are too high, then there is an excess supply of output and there is an increase in unsold stocks for producers. This means that producers need to cut back on production to avoid excess in inventories. When the price level is below equilibrium, there is an excess demand in the short run, which signals to producers to expand output. Shortages of resources will also lead to a general rise in costs and prices.\nChanges in macroeconomic equilibrium shows how the economy reacts to shocks to the real GDP and price level.", "score": 0.015005382202922546, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:0d2381ff-3040-4ee9-a7e6-24db65c9e193>", "text": "Financial markets, monetary policy, and the real economy\nThis thesis studies the interactions between financial markets, monetary policy, and the real economy. It analyses the role of financial markets in business cycle fluctuations and explores issues concerning systemic financial stability. Chapter One develops a dynamic general equilibrium model in which firms and banks face financial frictions in obtaining external funds. The model exhibits an unconventional bank capital channel as monetary policy affects the economy partly via its effect on bank capital. We show that the dynamic interactions between bank capital, firm net worth and asset price amplify and propagate the effect of a monetary shock in the macroeconomy. Chapter Two empirically investigates the importance of financial markets in the monetary transmission. The analysis is based on the argument that the real money stock serves as a proxy for the relative yields of various non-money assets that matter for aggregate demand. Using Thailand data, we find that the two-asset assumption is biased and that this problem can be ameliorated by introducing an explicit role for money into standard macroeconomic models. Chapter Three develops a numerically-solvable version of our general model [Goodhart, Suni-rand, and Tsomocos (2003)] to analyse financial fragility. The model incorporates heterogeneous agents and therefore leads to different simulation results from those obtained when using standard representative agent models; the effect of a shock depends on the part of the economy on which it falls and can generally shift the distribution of income and welfare between agents. Chapter Four proposes a general equilibrium model incorporating three heterogeneous banks. This allows us to study not only the interactions between any two individual banks, but also their inter-relationship with the rest of the banking sector. The model is calibrated against real UK banking data and therefore can be implemented as a risk assessment tool for financial regulators and central banks.", "score": 0.013787700825948985, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:ec145991-fc21-4474-8e80-8a05d02233f6>", "text": "Relationship between consumer price index and exchange rate xotaxi756603876\nEasily calculate how the buying power of the US dollar has changed from 1913 to 2018; get inflation rates, , US inflation news.\n118 The dynamics of money supply, exchange rate , inflation in Nigeria 1 Introduction Nigeria s weak economic base became problematic from the.

While we easily recognize a human footprint, how readily can you recognize the footprint of various animals?\nWhile spending a day or night in the forest, look around you.

Some have even questioned whether the observed features are footprints at all. However, collectively, the researchers behind this study have published over 400 papers on tracks, so we are pretty confidence we know what they are.\nAbstractWe describe late Miocene tetrapod footprints (tracks) from the Trachilos locality in western Crete (Greece), which show hominin-like characteristics. They occur in an emergent horizon within an otherwise marginal marine succession of Messinian age (latest Miocene), dated to approximately 5.7 Ma (million years), just prior to the Messinian Salinity Crisis. The tracks indicate that the trackmaker lacked claws, and was bipedal, plantigrade, pentadactyl and strongly entaxonic. The impression of the large and non-divergent first digit (hallux) has a narrow neck and bulbous asymmetrical distal pad. The lateral digit impressions become progressively smaller so that the digital region as a whole is strongly asymmetrical. A large, rounded ball impression is associated with the hallux.Morphometric analysis shows the footprints to have outlines that are distinct from modern non-hominin primates and resemble those of hominins. The interpretation of these footprints is potentially controversial. The print morphology suggests that the trackmaker was a basal member of the clade Hominini, but as Crete is some distance outside the known geographical range of pre-Pleistocene hominins we must also entertain the possibility that they represent a hitherto unknown late Miocene primate that convergently evolved human-like foot anatomy.\nNo, Crete was connected by a land bridge at the time.* This was in the Messinian period, so not much water in the Med.*ETA: Well, I think it was.

(As we’ll see below, these tracks do tell a story, but not the one you may have seen in the news!)\nAlaska’s many fossilized dinosaur tracks and bird tracks preserved in Cretaceous rock were first discovered in Denali National Park in 2005, and discoveries have continued in other places too, with a particularly rich find along the Yukon River.

The tracks are in an Upper Cretaceous outcrop uncovered by erosion of a 590-foot-long cliff face. Fiorillo believes the tracks were left when a hadrosaur herd trampled a muddy riverbank 69 to 72 million years ago.\n“Denali is one of the best dinosaur footprint localities in the world,” explains Fiorillo, curator of earth sciences at the Perot Museum of Nature and Science in Dallas. “What we found that last day [of the expedition] was incredible—so many tracks, so big and well preserved.

These rarest of impressions yielded information about soft tissue form and structure not normally accessible in fossilized bones. The Ileret footprints constitute the oldest evidence of an essentially modern human-like foot anatomy.\nFoot bones are rarely preserved because they are small, encased in flesh, and easily consumed by carnivores. Consequently, our knowledge of foot anatomy and function in early hominins is poor.\nTo ensure that comparisons made with modern human and other fossil hominid footprints were objective, the Ileret footprints were scanned and digitized by the lead author, Professor Matthew Bennett of Bournemouth University in the United Kingdom.\nPublished as the cover story in the Feb. 27 issue of the journal Science, the anatomical interpretation is the conclusion of Rutgers Professor John W.K. Harris* and an international team of colleagues.\nThe authors of the Science paper reported that the upper sediment layer contained three footprint trails: two trails of two prints each, one of seven prints and a number of isolated prints. Five meters deeper, the other sediment surface preserved one trail of two prints and a single isolated smaller print, probably from a juvenile.\nIn these specimens, the big toe is parallel to the other toes, unlike that of apes where it is separated in a grasping configuration useful in the trees.

University scienists were called in. They dug into the creek bank following the tracks; and to their amazement, and horror, a number of yards back under the bank the dinosaur tracks were crossed by perfectly formed footprints of three humans. Evolutionists agreed that the footprints looked exactly like human footprints, and fit no other known animal. But they said the footprints could not be human because human beings and dinosaurs did not live at the same time. Their bias would not allow them even to consider the possibility. For, if humans and dinosaurs existed together on the earth, that would doom the evolutionary theory. It would leave the door open for the possibility of a Creator.\nAn even more dramatic development occurred in 1997. Dinosaur remains were found encased in ice in Alaska. To the scientists' extreme excitement and also apprehension, when they put the bones under the microscope, they discovered two things. They discovered live red blood cells in the bone and they discovered, attached to the bone, soft tissue which was described as still transparent and pliable (elastic). The comment was written that the bones appeared to be no more than 200 to 300 years old.

Their explanation is that some \"mysterious process which we know nothing about must have peserved these for all those millions of years.\" And this comes from people who actually have earned college degrees, and who reject even the possibility of the supernatural.

He began to outline the footprints with pen to make it easier for people to see what he saw. Outlining the edge made it easier for people to see the surface through his eyes, to see the foot of an ancient beast that walked across a soft muddy surface.\nWith the simple outline the ancient footprint becomes easier to see and additional features become apparent. The delicate features of each toe or perhaps even skin texture become observable on the hard rock surface. Other details also become apparent.\nLooking again at the same rock, the ancient five toed footprint on the surface is now quite clear.

The Samaritan, to a first century Jew, is not the oppressed, but the oppressor. Modern spins on this parable cast the Samaritan as a hated social outcast, but he is more like a member of Hamas. Samaria was the place Dinah was raped, the place Abimelech murdered his rivals, the place Jotham told his parable of the Trees, the place Ahab built an altar to Baal.

Passover traditions are also reflected in the way in which the Exodus story is told: in the Passover traditions of Ashkenazi Jews, the story will simply be told while in the Passover traditions of both Sephardi Jews and Mizrahi Jews, the story will be both told and acted out, but this Passover custom will vary from place to place.\nThere are also distinct Passover traditions for the middle days and seventh day (and eighth day for most Jewish persons who live outside Israel) of Passover.", "score": 0.828266501, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:aa2f3107-7e2e-4408-8a47-6506cda6ecb1>", "text": "Question from a Site Viewer\nWhat is the historical background for the term “seat of mockers?” Where did it originate, and why?\nIf I understand your question correctly, you are asking for the historical context of the phrase “seat of mockers.” I take it that you are referencing Psalm 1:1, where the person is declared happy who does not walk in the advice of transgressors, does not stand in the way of those who miss the mark with God (sinners), and does not sit in the seat of mockers.\nWhen we try to determine the historical context of a Biblical phrase, we begin and many times end with Scripture. This is because there is not a body of other literature we can use to shine light on the meaning of the phrase. When David wrote this Psalm, it was approximately 1000 years before the time of Christ. We have no other Jewish writings from that time to explore in order to determine the meaning of terms. We certainly have later writings, but later writings are of questionable use in determining what someone meant centuries earlier. And the pagan writings that we have are from different cultures and contexts. They are of no help in determining the meaning of the term.\nWe have archaeological evidence that sometimes helps us in interpretation. But often it is somewhat of a leap to state that a set of stones that are uncovered somehow link back to the Biblical text. Accordingly, most often, especially in Scriptures predating Jesus’ life on this earth, all we have is the Scriptures to use in determining the historical background. Such is true with the phrase “seat of mockers.” The only time this phrase appears in Scripture is in Psalm 1:1. We do not know if David is thinking about a group of reprobates sitting around and making fun of God’s priests and prophets, if David’s focus is more broadly those who mock all authority, or if the thought is more narrow, involving a specific situation. At least, that is, we do not know from the phrase itself.\nHowever, we are not left without insight into the meaning of the phrase. The phrase itself is set in the rich context of Psalm 1. I believe that Psalm 1 is rightly viewed as the introductory Psalm to the entire Psalter.

He went down to Egypt with meager numbers and sojourned there; but there he became a great and very populous nation…” (Deuteronomy 26:5)\nThe opening words of this passage have been the subject of considerable controversy for centuries. According to most commentators, the “wandering father” is identified as Jacob. This would certainly fit neatly into the Biblical narrative, as Jacob did indeed go down to Egypt with his sons during a period of famine.\nIn the traditional Passover Haggadah, however, the Rabbis translate the Hebrew “My father was a wandering Aramean” (“arami oved avi“) very differently. By changing the vocalization of the Hebrew “oved” (“wandering”) to “ibed” (“destroyed”), they render the text to mean: “An Aramean sought to destroy my father.” (The Haggadah identifies this would-be murderer as Laban who, by threatening Jacob, “sought to uproot us all.”)\nSo which is it?\nIn true Jewish fashion, the debate rages on. Among the classical commentators, Rashi supports the Haggadah’s reading, while others, including Ibn Ezra adhere to the conventional interpretation. Rashbam accepts the “wandering Aramean” interpretation as well, but identifies the wanderer as Abraham rather than Jacob.\nBeyond the fancy hermeneutics, however, I’m struck by the two spiritual models suggested by these respective translations. One highlights our wanderings, identifying our peoplehood with our collective seeeking – our desire to journey toward a better and more blessed future. The second model suggests we are essentially a hunted and hated people, forever on the run from those who would seek our destruction.\nThese two readings illuminate a critical question that inform our collective Jewish self-understanding to this very day.

Korg has just unveiled a raft of new products to be shown at NAMM 2024, the most exciting of which is the long-awaited successor to the beloved microKorg.\nReleased in 2002, the microKorg was an affordable but deceptively powerful synth that became hugely popular with everyone from amateur knob-twiddlers to world-famous artists - Tame Impala and The Prodigy can be counted among the synth's fans. One of the 21st century's most iconic instruments, the microKorg was a 'first synth' for a whole generation of music-makers.\n22 years on, Korg has announced the microKorg 2, which it tells us captures the essence of what made the original a global success while bringing an array of new features to the table. On first glance, the most noticeable upgrade is the synth's 2.8-inch colour display, which offers advanced control of the synth's parameters alongside animated effects and an oscilloscope view that visualizes your patches.\nLike its predecessor, microKorg 2 is built around a virtual analogue synth engine. The synth's polyphonic architecture can handle up to eight voices, and sounds can be layered in Dual mode to create multi-timbral patches. The synth comes with 512 presets categorized into eight banks labelled by genre, and custom sounds can be saved in its 64-slot patch memory.\nmicroKorg 2's sounds can be processed through a range of effects that are grouped into three categories: modulation, delay and reverb. There's also a two-band parametric EQ for further sound-sculpting. Like its little brother, the synth is equipped with a powerful vocoder and vocal processor and comes bundled with a goose-neck condenser microphone.\nIn addition to classic vocoder effects, microKorg 2's vocal processor offers Auto-Tune-style pitch correction and a harmonizer for creating layered and pitch-shifted vocals. Another new feature for the microKorg 2 is the loop recorder, a handy tool for recording performances to create layered compositions.\nLike the original, microKorg 2 is outfitted with a 37-key velocity-sensitive keyboard, but we're told that the new version has been redesigned to enhance playability and provide a natural feel.", "score": 0.02621046316260346, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:4e588d51-9b71-41de-b875-6294a4750315>", "text": "Korg's latest iteration of the popular MicroKorg analog synth, the new MicroKorg XL+, is now available in stores in the U.S. It contains a reimagined palette of analog modeled sounds plus new dedicated PCM for Korg's SGProX piano, the M1 and VOX organs, as well as recognizable \"Tape\" instruments.

Following the highly successful year long Steel Wheels/Urban Jungle world tour, The Rolling Stones take another extended hiatus, to rest from the road, and for Keith Richards and Mick Jagger to work on outside solo projects. By the Fall of 1993, the band reconvene to record a new album, but this time it is without original bassist and co-founding member Bill Wyman. Then 54 years old and the eldest member of The Stones, its officially announced that Wyman has retired from the band. His replacement is bassist Darryl Jones, formerly a sideman for Miles Davis and Sting. Selected by Jagger and Charlie Watts, Jones fills the position vacated by Wyman, but as a hired hand and is not an official member. With their contract with Sony Music ending in 1991, they sign with Virgin/EMI worldwide. Looking to shake things up, they work with producer Don Was, fresh off his recent successes with Bonnie Raitt and The B-52’s.

They were billed as a supporting act for several established U.S. stars including Bo Diddley, Little Richard and the Everly Brothers. This experience gave the Stones the opportunity to study their idols at work, which proved to be an important training ground for the young band's stagecraft.\nNeeding a hit in late 1963, the Stones turned to The Beatles who answered with the song 'I Wanna Be Your Man'. It indeed became a smash (#12 in the U.K.), but not before the outstanding B-side ('Stoned') was withdrawn from U.S. radio for its drug connotations. Just one of many British Invasion bands, the Stones soon began to pull away from the pack and by 1965, they had found their sound and were cranking out #1 mega hits like '(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction' and 'Get Off Of My Cloud'.\nBy 1966, the Stones branched out with the album Aftermath. New sounds like the sitar laden 'Paint It Black' and the marimba based 'Under My Thumb' fit in well with the artsy landscape of pop music. The early 1967 single 'Ruby Tuesday' (written by Richards and an uncredited Jones) showed more Beatles-like production with such instrumentation as cello and recorder, compliments of Brian Jones. A 1967 drug bust of Jagger and Richards further established the Stones as champions of the counter culture and they quickly put out the single 'We Love You' to thank their fans for supporting them through the ordeal. Featuring Beatles members John Lennon and Paul McCartney on backing vocals, 'We Love You' foreshadowed the experimentation that was to come on their next album.\nAlthough it was critically panned when released in late 1967 and is still considered by many to be an inessential part of their catalog, the blatantly psychedelic LP Their Satanic Majesties Request is an impressive and eclectic album that has gained in reputation over the years.

In extended periods of cold winter weather, all types of citrus need to be indoors.\nContainer-grown citrus can attract several insect pests. These pests become an even bigger problem when you bring the containers indoors for cold weather protection.\nWhile containers are outdoors they can become a haven for ants. Ants are attracted to aphids and scale insects that attack the citrus. To reduce this problem, control the aphids and scale insects and/or use ant baits or sprays around the outside of the container.\nSpider mites commonly infest citrus. They give the leaves a washed-out appearance. If fruit are present, mite feeding scars them and gives the fruit a brown appearance.\nCitrus rust mites feeding on the fruit surface cause surface blemishes that can reduce fruit size and increase fruit drop. When a fruit is injured in summer or fall, the injured surface is smooth and dark brown. This is known as “bronzing.” Rust mite feeding on fruit early in the spring injures the peel, which is somewhat rough in texture but lighter in color and is referred to as “sharkskin.”\nIf you find harmful insects such as scales, aphids, or mites, a household spray bottle of water with some mild dish soap (11 tsp/gallon water) could be all you need. If insects persist, the usual nursery treatment is a 1 percent solution of light horticultural oil.\nA relatively new insect, citrus leafminer, is showing up in citrus trees. Citrus leafminer larvae form mines predominantly in leaves but also in succulent stems and sometimes fruit. The larvae tunnel through the leaf epidermis, ingest the sap, and produce a chlorotic leaf patch. Citrus leafminers usually prevent young leaves from expanding, causing them to remain twisted and curled. Home gardeners can get excellent control of citrus leafminers by using spinosad insecticide.\nOccasionally citrus trees become infested with the orange-dog caterpillar, which is the larval form of the Giant Swallowtail butterfly. The caterpillars are a problem only on young trees, since one or two can completely strip a young tree of its foliage.\nCitrus trees grown in containers do not generally suffer from as many diseases as those grown in the ground.", "score": 0.844834268, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:ea9f9f2d-ec95-4b86-a017-a0f8f4c1fee7>", "text": "Damage: Citrus mealybug feeding results in wilted, distorted, and yellowed chlorotic leaves, premature leaf drop, stunted growth, and occasional death of infested plants or plant parts. The sugary honeydew secreted by citrus mealybugs falls on leaves and fruits below, resulting in the growth of sooty mold. In addition to its unsightly appearance, sooty mold may degrade fruit quality by reducing the photosynthetic capacity of leaves. (For more information on sooty mold, refer to Scale insects and mealybugs on ornamental plants.)\nFeeding under and adjacent to the button of oranges results in fruit drop, reducing crop yields. Oranges develop hard lumps as a result of mealybugs feeding, resulting in discolored and poor quality fruit. Development of sooty mold on the fruit leads to commercially unacceptable appearance of fruits and requires vigorous scrubbing before packing the fruits. If not removed from the fruit after harvest, the remaining mealybugs continue to breed, causing loss during transit and storage (Griffiths and Thompson 1957).\nPopulation Dynamics: Mealybugs are most common during the spring and early summer. Several overlapping generations occur in a year, but only one cycle (Spring-Summer) is of major concern to citrus growers in Florida, with peak infestations occurring in June or July. With the advent of the rainy season and warm weather, populations rapidly decline. In grapefruit groves, mealybugs persist in high numbers throughout the summer and into the fall. Reproduction in the greenhouse can occur year round, leading to continuous populations of mealybugs (Griffiths and Thompson 1957).\nSpread: Dispersal of citrus mealybugs may occur through active or passive modes. In addition to actively crawling between trees, the insects may be transported by wind, on bird’s feet, or by machinery and labor crews (Kerns et al. 2001). In addition, ants get attracted by the honey-dew released by mealybugs and, therefore, frequently carry them from one tree to another (Watson 1918).\nHost Plants (Back to Top)\nCitrus mealybugs are primarily pests of citrus, but have been collected from at least 27 host plant families including indoor ornamentals, vegetables, and fruits.

Currently, considerable research effort is being directed at developing a better understanding of the biology and management of the invasive species spotted wing drosophila (Drosophila suzukii), a significant pest of soft-skinned fruit crops throughout much of North America and abroad.

When a male becomes an adult it forms a loose white cocoon much like those found in the pupal stage of insects that have complete metamorphosis, moths for instance. The males emerge as small, two-winged insects that resemble fungus gnats but are usually weak fliers like aphids and are usually lighter in color. They can be distinguished from other flying insects by the two long filaments or tails that extend from the end of their abdomens. Researchers here at University of California-Riverside are deciphering the female pheromone that attract the males, and they hope that one day pheromones may be used in mating disruption and male trapping.\nThe adult female, on the other hand, looks like the immature form but is much larger. It may lay up to 600 eggs, usually in a cottony ovisac, which is a protective cottony mass that can cover the eggs as well as the female. Eggs hatch in 6-14 days, and the hatchlings are called crawlers like the first instars of scale insects and whiteflies. Crawlers will disperse for only a short distance from the egg sac and settle down to feed. They tend to cluster around and overlap each other for added protection from predators, parasites and the occasional contact pesticide application. They do not remain attached in the same spot during their lifetime like scale or whitefly, but can move to a new feeding site if disturbed or the food source changes for some reason. There may be as many as eight generations per year.\nEarly detection of mealybugs is very important, and monitoring requires regular inspection of host plants for waxy white deposits and the presence of ants and or sooty mold. Mealybugs prefer living in the tightest spaces on the plants such as buds, the base of stems and petioles, and the undersides of foliage. This behavior, as well as the waxy covering, makes it all the more difficult to contact mealybugs with pesticides. A contact spray often works inconsistently simply due to the fact that not every individual is contacted during application. Therefore, multiple applications are necessary to hold mealybug populations in check.", "score": 0.84194392, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:c682d1ec-8c39-47c3-ac27-45b1313f3a5e>", "text": "Ornamental orange trees bear fruit just as edible orange trees do, but they are primarily grown for their foliage, flowers, ornamental fruit color and smaller sizes.

The Citrus Experiment Station at the University of California Riverside maintains and researches over 1,000 kinds of citrus trees. Some ornamental sour orange trees in their collection include bergamot, Bouquet de Fleurs and chinotto. Oil of bergamot is pressed from bergamot orange rinds and gives Earl Grey tea its distinctive flavor. Bouquet de Fleurs bears sweetly scented flowers that are used to make perfume. Chinotto orange, or myrtle-leaf orange, is a dwarf ornamental that shows beautifully in patio pots because its small orange fruits are profuse and long-lasting on the tree.\nCitrus Leafminer and Peelminer\nThe citrus leafminer is appropriately named because its larvae mine tunnels through citrus fruit leaves. The adult leafminer is a moth that lays eggs on the undersides of leaves. When larvae hatch, they begin tunneling through tender new-growth foliage and leave telltale trails of frass, or excrement. When larvae are ready to pupate, they emerge from leaf tunnels and roll leaf edges around themselves. Peelminer is also a citrus moth, but its larvae feed on fruit instead of leaves.\nCitrus looper larvae are small worms that are the immature form of a moth. Adult female moths lay 100 eggs at a time, several times a year. Worms have legs at the fronts and backs of their bodies, but not in the middle. Their physical structure allows them a looping, or inching, mobility that gives them the common name of inchworm.

This particular moth species poses a significant threat to the citrus industry, causing various difficulties for citrus growers.\nFalse Codling Moths are primarily inactive during the daytime but become active during specific periods of the night. This nocturnal behavior influences their interaction with their environment.\nAlso Known As:\nThis moth species is also commonly referred to as the Citrus Codling Moth or Orange Moth, reflecting its association with citrus fruits.\nThe False Codling Moth exhibits a wide host range, affecting both citrus and non-citrus crops. Citrus hosts, such as oranges and lemons, are highly susceptible to infestation. Additionally, non-citrus hosts, including guava, plums, beans, and peaches, are also at risk.\nThe life cycle of the False Codling Moth consists of several distinct stages. The female moth typically lays its eggs between 5:00 PM and 11:00 PM. These eggs are usually deposited on the surface of the host fruit, but they can also be found on leaves, fallen fruit, or smooth surfaces. The time required for egg incubation varies depending on the temperature, ranging from 2 to 22 days. Once hatched, the larvae feed on the fruit and survive for 12 to 65 days, influenced by weather conditions.\nAfter reaching maturity, they leave the fruit by descending to the ground using silken threads. The pupal stage is regulated by both temperature and gender, with warmer conditions accelerating emergence. Males reach maturity within 13 to 48 days, while females take 11 to 40 days. Under favorable conditions, a single female moth can lay up to 800 eggs, contributing to rapid population growth. The lifespan of males ranges from 14 to 58 days, while females live for approximately 16 to 80 days. The False Codling Moth can have 2 to 10 generations in a single year.\nTo identify the presence of the False Codling Moth, one should observe its various life stages:\n1.

This is not a new threat, indeed three years ago the National Academy of Science produced a report on the imminent danger of this insect-carried bacterial disease.\nThe disease is spread by the Asian citrus psyllid, and can move rapidly through an orchard, rendering the trees unproductive at best. Citrus greening causes the yield of affected trees to decrease, and as it progresses their leaves become blotchy, new shoots are yellow, and the fruit is small, lopsided and may have an off flavor.\nAs noted in The NY Times article, standard cross-breeding of current orange varieties with plants resistant to the bacteria holds little hope such plants have not been found. Thus the only hope for citrus farmers is to control the insect carriers by increased pesticide spraying, or using genetic engineering to insert a gene or genes from other organisms that will make the orange trees immune to the bacterium and the psyllid.\nIn fact, the NAS report, while advocating earlier detection and destruction of infected trees, notes Genetic engineering holds the greatest hope for generating trees with [the desired] traits.\nThe problem is the mind-set of many in the public that genetic engineering is dangerous and to be avoided. Thus, citrus growers are between the proverbial rock and hard place if they don t use some form of genetic engineering to combat citrus greening, they could well lose their orchards. But if they do use it, they re concerned about public anti-GMO attitudes.\nSo here is a sad example of how the scare-mongers can negatively impact an entire industry, perhaps seal the doom of a valuable food crop, and cause the increased use of pesticides, cautions ACSH s Dr. Ruth Kava. She adds, We see this incipient tragedy in Florida and around the world at the same time that various states are considering enacting misguided laws to require the labeling of any foods that contain genetically-engineered ingredients.

Many citrus diseases are graft-transmissible; they can cause stunting, yield loss and even death in some scion and rootstock combinations, yet other citrus varieties may be symptomless carriers. For most graft-transmissible diseases, symptoms will not be seen in nursery trees, the signs will appear a few years later in the orchard. By that time, the disease may have spread to surrounding trees through root grafting or on cutting tools. Nothing can be done to save infected trees; you need to pull the trees out and replant.\nIn Australia, the Auscitrus propagation scheme supplies budwood and rootstock seed to industry from trees that have been tested for graft-transmissible diseases by the citrus pathology team at the New South Wales Department of Primary Industries (NSW DPI). The NSW DPI testing service is supported by research to ensure the most efficient and sensitive diagnostic tests are used. Auscitrus also checks budwood source trees for trueness to type and maintains budwood source trees in a secure facility where all pest and disease issues are managed to the highest standard.\nBudwood shipments can be traced beyond the source trees, back to the original mother tree held in the National Citrus Repository. New variety imports and local selections are maintained as ‘foundation trees’ in insect-proof repository houses (matching houses in 2 locations) and tested regularly to ensure their high health status.

The citrus canker epidemic was greatly exacerbated in Brazil, especially in São Paulo State where the number of disease foci increased from 25 in 1995 to 4,180 in 1999. In 1999, the disease was detected in 299,856 trees. As a consequence, 1,737,545 trees were eradicated. This rapid temporal increase of diseased trees occurred concomitantly with a change in the spatial pattern of the epidemic. Strongly aggregated patterns, typical of citrus canker from 1957 to 1995, gave way to less aggregated and even “at random” patterns and presence of satellite foci far away from main foci became very common (5). This change in the spatial pattern of diseased trees is thought to be caused by the leafminer, despite the fact that the insect is not a vector of the pathogen. Leafminer wounds are very susceptible to infection by bacterial aerosols formed during turbulent weather. Leafminer wounds are very different from natural wounds and are characterized by: (i) a delay in the plant healing reaction (one day for a wound caused by wind, thorns, or pruning versus 10 to 14 days for wounds caused by the miner); and (ii) lower inoculum doses to cause disease (1/100 to 1/1000 of the dose required for infection through natural openings).\nBased on the analysis of 203 disease incidence maps of infected orchards just prior to eradication, it was proposed that the presence of the leafminer changed the dispersal function of the disease by flattening the dispersal gradient over a greater distance. As a consequence of this study, a new law was enacted in the state of São Paulo in July 1999, whereby groves with incidences higher than 0.5% are completely eradicated and those with incidences at or below 0.5% have all diseased and exposed trees within a radius of 30 m destroyed (5).", "score": 0.056054174348514, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:5e0bc5a6-6667-4757-83c5-72eb2159e6b1>", "text": "Annapolis, MD; March 23, 2017 -- Orchard growers looking for alternatives to honey bees for managed pollination services have new reason to be optimistic about the potential of one honey bee cousin, the blue orchard bee.\nA recent research experiment has shown blue orchard bees can be a sustainable option in tart cherry orchards, and a simple change to the distribution of the bees' nesting boxes makes the bees more likely to remain in the orchard to nest--a crucial requirement for their viability as a cost-effective managed pollinator. The results of the study will be published next week in the Entomological Society of America's Journal of Insect Science.\nUnlike social bee species that gather in colonies, the blue orchard bee (Osmia lignaria) is a solitary bee that nests in cavities in wood, stems, or even artificial materials like cardboard or paper tubes.

Boyle's experiment, conducted in April and May of 2016 in Santaquin, Utah, tested this approach against a uniform design that spread small nest boxes evenly throughout the test area.\nThe results showed a successful return of bees to nesting sites in both distribution types--meaning females produced more total new larvae in the nests than the number of bees initially released.", "score": 0.043601546599298394, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:96f7eacf-228d-44bd-8847-6cdc5c0948bc>", "text": "Comparison of Winter Habitats in Jamaica Used by American Redstarts\nJanuary 1, 2006 by Gregory Gough\nAs tropical forests are cut down, habitat for birds that nest in temperate regions, and migrate to overwinter in tropical areas, is lost.

Annals of Applied Biology, 171(1), 70-88.\nDiaphorina citri, known as the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP), is the insect vector of a devastating citrus disease (huanglongbing; HLB), which has caused billions of dollars in damage in Florida since its detection in 2005. Data from long‐term monitoring programs in two Florida citrus groves were used to assess ACP demography and population ecology, which is needed to implement more effective management strategies for HLB. Seasonal patterns and correlations between ACP density estimates and a suite of environmental and community indicators, previously shown to influence ACP demography, were described and interpreted. Data were evaluated for evidence for spatial clustering and density‐dependent recruitment of ACP in a major outbreak event using Taylor power law analysis and by fitting a stochastic Beverton–Holt recruitment model using state‐space approach. Strong evidence for density‐dependent recruitment and spatial clustering was found and should be considered for future modelling work as it can greatly influence ACP populations by affecting their growth rates, dispersal behaviour and morphology, as well as HLB transmission. Observations of ACP density and dispersion in space and time, along with the estimated parameters from the Beverton–Holt model, suggested that intraspecific competition for resources may initiate both local, then widespread dispersal process, thus affecting grove‐wide and area‐wide HLB transmission. When these results were synthesised with those of parallel studies, the removal of several of these regulating factors in a single year could lead to widespread disease of the entire crop in a grove, and likely surrounding groves as well. We provide the first field evidence of the consequences of back‐to‐back ACP colonisation on the rapid spread of the HLB in a grove (a mechanism previously demonstrated in laboratory settings).

Near infrared indicates the amount of healthy foliage, plant vigor and crop type. If the trees have low near infrared values, it means the plants are under stress. Red edge indicates plant stress and nitrogen content. High red edge values indicate nitrogen stress and low water content in plant tissues.\nPatrick Brown, a pomology professor at UC Davis, is planning to use the virtual orchard to map nitrogen use in citrus.\n“We are currently working on developing models to help growers determine their fertilization demands and have been contrasting the results from real orchards with the virtual orchard,” Brown said. “We have already utilized the approach to contrast the estimates of tree growth and yield with whole tree excavations and harvests to help validate the virtual approach and provide a more accurate estimate of tree nitrogen demand.”\nUltimately, Brown hopes to develop a way for growers to rapidly and cheaply estimate the nitrogen demand of their orchards, monitor the status of their orchards and manage nitrogen fertilizer applications.\nIn addition to the color variations brought to light by the virtual orchard, the system provides detailed data on other aspects of the crop development.\n“We can learn canopy height and width, the spacing between the trees, total leaf area, canopy density and the amount of shaded area in the orchard,” Poureza said.\nThis data is of interest to scientists studying plant development, soil health and irrigation.\nFor example, UCCE agricultural water management specialist Daniele Zaccaria is researching the impact of soil-water salinity on water use by pistachio trees in the San Joaquin Valley.\n“In our on-going research study we are characterizing the functional relationships between soil-water salinity, canopy size and density and evapotranspiration of pistachio trees through the light interception by the canopy,” Zaccaria said.", "score": 0.00984394575634298, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:23d444fd-e427-4121-8d29-6d2df64c11e3>", "text": "Research and Education: Buy Fruit, Help Research\nProfits from fruit sales at UMass Cold Spring Orchard, along with public funding, contributions from commercial orchardists, and grants from the Massachusetts Fruit Growers' Association are used to manage the research and education facility in Belchertown.\nThe Cold Spring Orchard Horticultural Research Center conducts tree and small fruit research.

This breakdown in cooperation resulted in the standard's loss of credibility, causing monetary authorities to shift policy priorities toward defending exchange rate parities, and thus injected massive interest rate uncertainty into the economy, which in turn, lead to a large reduction in aggregate spending.

Under the gold standard, each country set the value of its currency in terms of gold and took monetary actions to defend the fixed price. It is possible that had the Federal Reserve expanded greatly in response to the banking panics, foreigners could have lost confidence in the United States' commitment to the gold standard. This could have led to large gold outflows, and the United States could have been forced to devalue. Likewise, had the Federal Reserve not tightened in the fall of 1931, it is possible that there would have been a speculative attack on the dollar and the United States would have been forced to abandon the gold standard along with Great Britain.\nWhile there is debate about the role the gold standard played in limiting U.S. monetary policy, there is no question that it was a key factor in the transmission of America's economic decline to the rest of the world. Under the gold standard, imbalances in trade or asset flows gave rise to international gold flows. For example, in the mid-1920s intense international demand for American assets such as stocks and bonds brought large inflows of gold to the United States. Likewise, a decision by France after World War I to return to the gold standard with an undervalued franc led to trade surpluses and substantial gold inflows. (See also balance of trade.)\nBritain chose to return to the gold standard after World War I at the prewar parity. Wartime inflation, however, implied that the pound was overvalued, and this overvaluation led to trade deficits and substantial gold outflows after 1925. To stem the gold outflow, the Bank of England raised interest rates substantially. High interest rates depressed British spending and led to high unemployment in Great Britain throughout the second half of the 1920s.\nOnce the U.S. economy began to contract severely, the tendency for gold to flow out of other countries and toward the United States intensified. This took place because deflation in the United States made American goods particularly desirable to foreigners, while low income reduced American demand for foreign products.

To date, the use of AI in education has been limited and at times contested; most arguments against it centre on how it will make teachers redundant and learning more automated than it is currently. Rather than replacing teachers and making learning impersonal, AI could take learning to a completely new level. It could instantly generate an astounding amount of information, curate supplementary learning resources to meet individual student interests and needs, provide teachers with a virtual teaching assistant, and allow students to connect with peer learners as well as a virtual peer or tutor wherever and whenever needed. In the classroom, this could increase valuable time for more teacher-student and student-student interaction and more engaging and immersive learning experiences. The collective wisdom of teachers and students could be garnered to expand the realm of possibilities for education. What are the implications of AI for the future of education? UNESCO MGIEP embraces the need for education to prepare learners for the world profoundly changed by new frontiers in AI.", "score": 0.851045787, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:935ed7c4-9976-4bba-bb20-dce7ad1aff28>", "text": "Innovative Approaches to School Digital Age Adaptation The traditional classroom has been transformed into a dynamic and interactive learning environment as a result of the enormous changes brought about by the digital age in the education industry.\nWith the introduction of technology, educational institutions are implementing cutting-edge strategies to improve the learning process and better prepare students for the future. To engage students and make learning more accessible, educators are adopting new tools and strategies, from online platforms to virtual reality.\nPersonalized learning, blended learning, robotics, gamification, and personalized learning are five cutting-edge ways that schools are adjusting to the digital age.\nWith these strategies, the traditional educational system is being redefined, opening the door to a better future where students will be better prepared to compete in the digital world.\nSo whether you’re a parent, teacher, or student, strap in and come along as we examine how schools are using technology to influence the future of education.\nDigital Technology and Education\nThe way we live, work, and study has changed as a result of the digital era. Education used to be restricted to a classroom’s four walls, where students sat and listened to lectures.\nHowever, everything has changed since the development of technology. Students may now access a wealth of material from all around the world thanks to the internet. They can work together with classmates from various nations, take part in online courses, and study at their speed.\nAs a result, schools are now embracing the digital era by utilizing technology to improve the educational process.\n5 Creative Ways to Adapt to the Digital Age\nGamification in Schools:\nGamification is the technique of integrating game elements into the learning process to make it more engaging and enjoyable.\nSchools can encourage students to learn, increase their involvement, and improve information retention by gamifying the learning process.\nFor instance, the Duolingo language-learning program employs gamification to teach users new languages. To encourage users to study and train, the app uses gaming aspects like points, levels, and leaderboards.\nWith over 300 million users as a result, Duolingo has emerged as one of the most well-liked language learning applications worldwide.\nGamification, though, is not just used for language learning. To make studying more interesting and enjoyable, schools are implementing gamification in several topics, including math, science, and social studies.\nGamification is reshaping and improving the conventional educational system by using human nature’s drive for accomplishment and competition.", "score": 0.849965036, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:f1d163d3-c3bf-401d-b27d-39b45160457b>", "text": "I have been approached to do the research for a >series of educational videos with accompanying posters on various >aspects of Southern African arts and crafts.

The movie attempted to visually represent the concept of Afro Futurism – where African design, culture, philosophy and alien technology meet.\nI found this fascinating and began researching what made this film so critically acclaimed, not only for it’s storytelling, but for representing the African Utopia that many have dreamed about. And at Automattic one of our design principles is about starting from curiosity, in this case mine.\nAfrica has a history of mixed cultures, and while the elements of that have been either detrimental or beneficial to a specific part of Africa (British Colonialism as one example), the elements of design from these cultures have been integrated into everyday society, in particular architecture as well as language.\nAs a result of this history of mixed cultures an interesting question would be;\nWhat makes Africa unique from a design perspective, and how do we communicate that in a way that creates empathy in our African customers?\nUsing South Africa as an example, the country has 11 languages, multiple cultures, and multiple traditional tribal kingdoms – if one of these cultures is a dominant one at the expense of the others, that impacts directly on diversity and inclusion. It also blurs the identifying elements of the nation by making one culture more important than the others.\nThis is a complex issue and raises another question;\nHow do you represent such a wide variety of identities in a singular individual or product?\nRepresentation of Color, Patterns, Typography & Language\nAn example of representing multiple cultures would be since the creation of the term “Rainbow Nation” – this was first mentioned by Archbishop Desmond Tutu to describe the post-apartheid South Africa, which aimed to be inclusive of all cultures within the nation. The national flag that was created as a result of the democratic election, combined multiple colours representing the many cultures, and the national anthem was also modified to include many of the official languages instead of 1 dominant language as before.", "score": 0.847948492, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:0b02f846-0f0d-4911-9f44-3464748ae356>", "text": "Over the course of the Refugee Education Challenge, we'll be featuring highlights of contributions from each of our themed mission areas.

More sustainable solutions do not necessarily mean exclusively deep technical thinking, but rather thinking about those who will use the system; by thinking out of the box, using other fields experiences and bringing them back to the specific problem.\nI think examples like this one can be useful in all fields that are taught at VT. Allowing students to role play with their majors and use their current settings (where they live, problems they face, etc) to combine their learning with real life problem, which ultimately they are going to face once they graduate.\nIn recent years there have been many efforts to comprehensively teach sustainability and its applications to engineering and engineering design. Furthermore, the concept of sustainability in technical majors has often been presented as an environmental problem, when it actually cuts across many systems such as cultural systems, different value systems, economic and technological frontiers, and others. Sustainability crosses multiple dimensions and has various levels of learning—undergraduate, graduate, and professional. To normalize the discussion about teaching sustainability, the UK Joint Board of Moderators built Guidelines for Sustainability that stated four absolute principles for sustainability education in engineering programs.", "score": 0.006443526130741103, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:aa5fe3d5-eeb5-4986-965c-31b47ad194b8>", "text": "By these statutes the purpose of the Order is “to revive in a modern manner the spirit and the ideal of the Crusades, with the arms of the faith, of the apostolate, and of Christian Charity.” Specifically the Order “is zealous for the preservation and the spread of the faith in Palestine, supports and furthers the missions of the Latin Patriarchate of Jerusalem, and gives assistance to its good works and to it charitable, cultural and social undertakings,” and “champions the defense of rights of the Catholic Church in the Holy Land, the cradle of the Order.”\nIn 1962, following the death of Cardinal Canali, Pope John XXIII chose His Eminence Eugene Cardinal Tisserant, Dean of the sacred College of Cardinals to act as Cardinal Grand Master of the Order.

In these communities the austerity of a religious rule was maintained.\nIt was to the Order of the Franciscans that the custody of the Holy Land was entrusted following the fall of the Latin Kingdom. During the long period of guardianship the Superior, or Custos, of the Franciscans continued to bestow the Order of the Holy Sepulchre – a right confirmed by Pope Leo X. However, in 1847 the Order underwent a rebirth with the re-establishment of the Latin Patriarchate by Pope Pius IX. The office of Grand Master of the Order was transferred from the Custos of the Franciscans to the Patriarch, and in 1868 new statutes were approved for the Order by the same Pope.\nThe statutes created three classes of Knights, and in 1888 Pope Leo XIII authorized the conferring of the Order upon women, who were to be styled Dames of the Holy Sepulchre and to share in all the rights and privileges of the Knights.\nPope St. Pius X took upon himself the office of Grand Master in 1907, and further honored the Knights of the Order should henceforth be suspended from a military trophy, in commemoration of the Order’s past military role, and by granting the Knights the use of the white cape with the cross of the Order displayed on its left side.\nThe pontificate of Pope Pius XII was of enormous significance for the Order of the Holy Sepulchre as it was under that Pope that the purpose of the Order in the modern world was clarified.

However, the less known story is that these cape wearing Catholics form part of a vital lay order of the Church tasked with great responsibility.\nThe Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre of Jerusalem (EOHSJ) can trace its origins, through tradition, to the First Crusade (1099). However, documented evidence suggests that the first investiture of Knights at the Holy Sepulchre dates back to 1336.

Switches funnel data toward its intended destination, and a virtual switch inspects data packets to then intelligently direct communication on the network.\nThe key difference between standard and distributed switches lies in their scope. A standard switch works within one physical host only; it's not possible to add any flexibility or share the switch with other hosts. VMware's vSphere distributed switch (vDS) is shared between hosts, available as a virtual device between the machines involved. It functions as one single virtual switch that connects hosts as well as virtual machines (VMs).\nLearn more about virtual networking\nConsiderations when designing a virtual switch\nVMware networking garners attention\nNetwork traffic analysis adapts to the virtual world\nDon't forget about virtual switch security\nVMware distributed switches debuted with vSphere 4 and received major upgrades in 2012. There are many similarities between standard and distributed switch types. Distributed virtual switches provide connectivity for VMs and the VMkernel interface that manages traffic between hosts. A distributed switch also needs physical network adapters to connect to the external physical network.\nDistributed switches are more flexible than standard switches, allowing different hosts to use the switch as long as they exist within the same cluster. At first glance, this may seem to complicate the configuration, but in fact, distributed switches make adding new hosts to the cluster relatively easy.\nCreating a vSphere distributed switch consists of two steps. First, create the switch from the data center context. Then, add all hosts that will use the virtual switch. When adding the virtual switch to the data center, you'll have the option to select between three different types. If you need Network I/O Control and port mirroring support, you'll need the version 5 vSphere distributed switch. If you also have vSphere 4.0 or 4.1 hosts, you'll need to select the switch type compatible with these product versions.\nAfter creating the virtual switch, add a dvPort Group. Port groups are required to connect anything to the virtual switch, rendering the switch usable. To add dvPort Groups, select the distributed virtual switch and go through the setup wizard for the port group and associated ports.\nThe key difference between standard and distributed switches lies in their scope.", "score": 0.826007903, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:c45299ad-c4e1-4652-9891-dadb54c20803>", "text": "D.

Because VMware needed a virtual NIC that was designed for virtualization and could also help minimize I/O virtualization overhead.\nVMXNET3 offers better performance then VMXNET2, which was introduced in VI3. VMXNET3 also has some new features, such as Receive-Side Scaling (RSS), TCP Segmentation Offload (TSO) over IPv6 and large TX and RX ring sizes that can help increase host scalability for VMs with high network loads.

A feature that was introduced to vCenter Server 2.5 called Virtual Machine Monitoring (VMM ) extends the HA feature to be able to detect guest OS failures by monitoring a heartbeat provided by VMware Tools. If a guest OS failure is detected—such as a Windows blue screen—the heartbeat would stop being received, and the VM would be restarted on the same host. VMware went a step further with this to try and prevent false restarts and enabled VMM to check for any VM disk and network to be certain that the OS was truly unresponsive. This feature works with any OS as long as VMware Tools is installed.\n• Hardware clustering — Although the underlying physical hardware of a vSphere host may be redundant to protect against a single hardware component failure, vSphere also provides some virtual hardware redundancy at the networking and storage layers. Virtual Switches, or vSwitches, can be configured with multiple physical NICs so VMs don’t lose network connectivity if a failure with the connectivity of a physical NIC occurs. With storage adapters, vSphere supports multi-pathing—except for NFS devices—so if a single path to a storage device fails, alternate paths can be used.\nFT clustering in vSphere\nThe true clustering feature in vSphere is FT, which maintains an identical copy of a VM on a second host. This clustering is done at the virtualization layer, and the guest OS is unaware of it.\nFT is designed to protect only against a host failure where you would normally lose all the VMs on a host until the host was brought back up or the VMs were started on other hosts with the HA feature. It does not protect against an OS failure or other hardware failures or those with a shared storage device. The primary VM on one host and the secondary VM on another host stay in sync by using a technology called Record/Replay.\nFT works by creating a secondary VM on another host that shares the same virtual disk file as the primary VM and then transferring the CPU and virtual device inputs from the primary VM (record) to the secondary VM (replay) through a FT-logging NIC so it’s in sync with the primary and ready to take over in case of a failure.", "score": 4.77952454443304e-08, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:9ce6b10b-1315-47fc-8649-46b05cb15bd1>", "text": "Would you like to learn how to administer a vSphere infrastructure for an organization?\nModern businesses, these days, depend on virtualization to help them scale more efficiently while cutting hardware costs. VMware vSphere is the most popular server virtualization product in the market. If virtualization is an unfamiliar term and you are just being introduced to VMware, this article will close that information gap for you. So, keep reading and learn what vSphere does and how it fits into the big picture of your virtualization environment.\nFor your reference, there are three types of virtualization:\n- Server Virtualization: It allows more than one server to work on one machine, instead of multiple machines. Virtual servers increase efficiency by minimizing operating costs, improving performance, deploying workloads more quickly, and getting rid of unnecessary server complexity.\n- Network Virtualization: It recreates physical networks and allows applications to function independently of hardware. Hence, multiple computers are able to communicate and share data across remote locations.\n- Desktop Virtualization: It gives employees access to their work computers without the actual hardware. Organizations can quickly respond to a company’s needs and opportunities, allowing branch offices, mobile employees and outsourced team members to access information they need without a hardware system being shipped to them.\nWhat is VMware vSphere?\nVMware is a software solutions provider specializing in cloud and virtualization services that powers complex digital infrastructure. Released in 2009, VMware vSphere is a cloud computing virtualization platform that supports container-based application development. VMware vSphere enables your organization to power its computing environment for modern applications using any combination of containers, virtual machines, and Kubernetes.\nWhy choose VMware vSphere?\nvSphere 7 vSphere 7 has been rearchitected with native Kubernetes for application modernization.

Lets discuss each of these new features one by one and lets start at the top with Cross vSwitch vMotion. Cross vSwitch vMotion basically allows you to do what the name tells you. It allows you to migrate virtual machines between different vSwitches. Not just from vSS to vSS but also from vSS to vDS and vDS to vDS. Note that vDS to vSS is not supported. This is because when migrating from vDS metadata of the VM is transferred as well and the vSwitch does not have this logic and cannot handle the metadata. Note that the IP Address of the VM that you are migrating will not magically change, so you will need to make sure both the source and the destination portgroup belong to the same layer 2 network. All of this is very useful during for instance Datacenter Migrations or when you are moving VMs between clusters for instance or are migrating to a new vCenter instance even.\nNext on the list is Cross vCenter vMotion. This is something that came up fairly frequent when talking about vMotion, will we ever have the ability to move a VM to a new vCenter Server instance? Well as of vSphere 6.0 this is indeed possible. Not only can you move between vCenter Servers but you can do this with all the different migration types there are: change compute / storage / network. You can even do it without having a shared datastore between the source and destination vCenter aka “shared nothing migration. This functionality will come in handy when you are migrating to a different vCenter instance or even when you are migrating workloads to a different location. Note, it is a requirement for the source and destination vCenter Server to belong to the same SSO domain.

The investigation was carried out during the first 6 months of reactor operation. The reactor successfully separated the hydrolysis/acidogenesis stage from the methanogenesis stage. Bacterial 16S rDNA- and rRNA-based fingerprints obtained through amplicon length heterogeneity PCR (LH-PCR) were analyzed with a view to characterizing the bacterial community structure and the metabolically active community, respectively. Multivariate statistical tools showed that the rDNA-based fingerprints described a more temporal than compartmentalized distribution of similar bacterial communities. By contrast, the rRNA-based multivariate analyses described a distribution that was linked more to reactor performance parameters, especially during short time periods. Diversity indices calculated from fingerprint data were used to assess overall diversity shifts. The decrease in rRNA-based diversity observed through the reactor compartments was greater than the decrease in rDNA-based diversity. This finding indicates that the analysis of metabolically active bacteria diversity was more discriminative than the analysis based on the mere presence of bacteria. The observed decrease in diversity suggests that the bacterial community became specialized in degrading less diversified substrates through the compartments. All these findings suggest that rRNA-based analyses are more appropriate for monitoring reactor performance.\n- Date modified:", "score": 0.840012372, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:4ce787f7-15b4-4cce-ab13-7c53ddecb5c9>", "text": "Each agency has its inherent niche and\noptimal substrates, and the microbial community would adjust its\nstructure in response to the changing environment.

Tobacco use can lead to nicotine dependence and serious health problems. Cessation can significantly reduce the risk of suffering from smoking-related diseases. Tobacco dependence is a chronic condition that often requires repeated interventions, but effective treatments and helpful resources exist. Smokers can and do quit smoking. In fact, today there are more former smokers than current smokers. Nicotine Dependence - Nicotine is the psychoactive drug in tobacco products that produces dependence. Most smokers are dependent on nicotine. Nicotine dependence is the most common form of chemical dependence in the United States. Research suggests that nicotine is as addictive as heroin, cocaine, or alcohol. Quitting smoking is difficult and may require multiple attempts.

Here’s a rundown of the latest research evidence on this subject. Recent data indicates that more women than men in their young age (between 30 and 54 years) risk falling prey to lung cancer. The main cause is cigarette smoking. If you are one of those on the lookout for the best oncologist or a second opinion for lung cancer, then the study summarized here is relevant.\nJemal and the team carried out a nationwide study in the United States to explore the incidence of lung cancer. This study could have important implications for lung cancer treatment. The research team studied the data using several variables including ethnicity, sex, age, period of diagnosis, birth year, and incidence rate. They compared females and males in their population data between 1970 and 2016. On studying the data scientists found important conclusions for physicians and patients.\nData Reveals Important Insights for the Lung Cancer Doctor\nWhen scientists studied data from the past two decades, they found that the illness declined faster among males than females. This trend showed up in the Hispanic and non-Hispanic populations. It shows a trend reversal of the 1960s data. A rise in women smokers in the United States seems to be the cause behind an increase in the incidence of lung cancer.\nThe study recorded data for the six main types of cancers. These types were squamous cell carcinoma, small cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, specified carcinoma, unspecified carcinoma, and adenocarcinoma. Scientists completed a statistical analysis on data about the prevalence of current and former smoking. Therefore, smoking was a significant concern among women.\nCauses Identified Could Affect Lung Cancer Treatment Options\nThe research team identified several important causes of lung cancer that are quite relevant to the lung cancer doctor. First, the average number of cigarettes smoked by women was far lower than men. Women had a higher likelihood of smoking menthol-based cigarettes. Nevertheless, menthol-based cigarettes do not carry a risk higher than non-menthol cigarettes in terms of causing lung cancer. Women also used smokeless tobacco and cigars far less when compared to men.\nScientists also found that the risk of adenocarcinoma is more common in women than men.

The researchers noted that enjoying three bottles of wine a week carries the same risk as smoking approximately 8 cigarettes for men. For women, drinking that amount is equivalent to smoking around 23 cigarettes.\nThe findings also show that the risk of cancer is greater for women than it is for men.\nAccording to the research, drinking one bottle of wine (which is equivalent to approximately five glasses) raises a person’s absolute lifetime risk of cancer by 1% in male nonsmokers and 1.3% in nonsmoking females.\nDrinking has been linked to certain types of cancer.
