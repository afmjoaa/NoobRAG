It is with great pleasure that we are publishing this first development diary for Europa Universalis: The Board Game. We know that some of you have been waiting impatiently for this. Now it is finally here, and this diary is the first of many to come.\nAs you may already know, Paradox Interactive and Aegir Games have embarked on the great task of bringing Europa Universalis back to the tabletop.\nAs anyone vaguely familiar with the video game knows, EU is a complex game of many features. Accordingly, an epic 4X board game that offers the players the wide variety of options and choices that an EU board game should, will also have a lot different aspects to it. In these development diaries we will try to focus on one, or a few, of these at the time.\nIn this diary we will give an overview of the map board. This is the main playing area of the game, where such things as military conflicts, trade, exploration and the results of diplomatic actions will take place.\nThe Map Board\nFirst off I have to warn you that all of what you see in the photos here are temporary graphics used in the prototype version of the board game. Thus all the graphics are subject to change, and will have added details in the final product. Still, EU4 gamers should instantly recognise much of the look of the map.\nThe main map covers Europe and the Mediterranean region. In the smaller inserts on the left are maps of North and South America, Africa, Asia and Australia. As you may deduct from that, we are initially focusing on the European nations as playable realms. The scope of the board game, for playability reasons, needs be narrowed down a bit compared to the video game, and after all it is called Europa Universalis. Future expansions however, may take a closer look at other parts of the world.\nFurthermore, you will be able to section up the map and use smaller parts of it for smaller scenarios and lower player counts.\nAreas and Provinces\nThe map is divided into areas and sea zones. Inside each area there is a number of provinces, marked with the coats of arms of the realm they belong to. Armies move and fight battles in areas, while the ownership of provinces provide tax income, manpower and victory points. Winning a battle in an area will enable you to occupy hostile provinces inside that area.", "score": 0.818985105, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:c1d46885-513f-4793-99ae-66bcf4c7f5ef>", "text": "Europa Universalis IV has just been launched and I am sure that you have a great time playing the game. Fortunately, Paradox didn’t come up with just a sequel but a brand new and really challenging game, one that can prove really difficult to win for most of us. Therefore, I have decided to create this article and share with you the best Europa Universalis 4 countries to start with to have an easier shot at world domination and turning your country into the best one that ever was.\nOf course, some might agree that the real challenge and fun in the game comes from choosing some really tough starting countries, but I do think that an easy win can raise the morale and keep us going. So if that’s what you want, here are the best starting countries for Europa Universalis IV in our opinion:\n1. Portugal – considered the regular “easy” country in Europa Universalis games, your only worry should be to stay on the good side of Castille. It’s pretty isolated too and it’s great at helping you go on a full scale colonization. Strong navy is not optional, though!\n2. Castille – Neighbors with Portugal, so probably this “easy” part is passed on. Has the disadvantage of being France’s neighbor so also has to go colonial, but otherwise really easy to manage.\n3. France – considered one of the most powerful countries in the game, France gives you all options and it’s up for you to decide how to play: go colonial or not, France is a great choice.\n4. Ottomans – another really powerful country that can see you conquer the entire world (that was the initial plan, right?). You need to go on a full scale invasion and manage your ever-expanding empire, but the Ottomans have the advantage of being really powerful and situated in a region that opens up your gates for conquering… everything!\n5. England – being a island nation makes it very easy to manage. However, it’s a bit too isolated for my taste and the navy focus adds an extra degree of challenge, but if you want to try out things, England allows for quite a few mistakes to go unnoticed.\nSo these would be our 5 best Europa Universalis IV countries for an easy victory.

The ultimate goal is to conquer and forge an empire to dominate the single, shared, two-million-parcel game map.\nConfrontation and competition in Immortal Conquest: Europe begins with the player choosing their state. Similar to other strategy games, players need to grow and manage their own cities, expand their dominion by leveling up, and create and maintain alliances. However, the lands and resources in a single state are limited, which requires the player to constantly battle to expand their territory holdings.\nAll players share similar levels to begin so that they could partner with neighbors to upgrade quickly.

Previous Europa Universalis games started in 1492 (Columbus) or 1453 (the fall of Constantinople), two years of massive historical import. 1444, on the other hand, seems to demand a trip to Wikipedia. It's also worth noting that you can start a game at any point in EU4's timeframe, so you could jump straight to 1588 or 1776. Europa Universalis is real-time, instead of turn-based—the game is constantly moving (or paused), as opposed to Civilization, where you'll make all the decisions you need to, press a button, wait, and do it again a “year” later. Unlike Civilization with its dominant military tactics, Europa Universalis has to make sure that all parts of the game—building infrastructure, fighting battles, engaging in diplomacy, etc.—carry equal enough weight that that player can maintain interest in all of them.\nBecause of its format, grand strategic choices reign supreme in Europa Universalis: do I develop my military or my economy in my best province? Do I join a war against my rival or do I wait until I'm stronger? Set my economy to focus on colonial expansion or orient it toward trade? What makes the game excellent is that all these choices are set to be achieve a historical, or history-like result.\nOne of historical strategy games' greatest strengths is that the understanding of why and how leaders do horrible things. For example, in EU4, as Russia, you're surrounded by small nations that are quite easy to absorb, like the rump descendants of the Mongol Golden Horde. But if you take over those provinces, they'll have a different culture and religion than your own, which will make them more likely to rebel—unless you order their religion and culture changed to your own with a couple easy clicks to start the process. The game suggests you do it, even. It is pragmatically desirable, for the health of the nation, to engage in ethnic cleansing and forced conversions. It becomes impossible to be a good leader while maintaining moral standards.\nEuropa Universalis IV isn't the only game to use relatively simple mechanics to illustrate complex issues.", "score": 1.3393786509797722e-05, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:b2c45c31-c310-42dc-8942-3cde3c6f7d05>", "text": "Complication has commonly been the chief complaint closer to the series and Paradox’s other video games the usage of the equal engine.

No, hold on…FRODO is Jesus…\nIf I had a dollar for every student who tried to write that paper, I would have retired from teaching by now.\nSo what’s the problem? For one, labeling every heroic protagonist a Christ figure is lazy literary analysis. The heroic archetype is an archetype because it crosses cultural and temporal boundaries; it resonates with vastly diverse audiences and performs the same cultural functions, transmitting social values and providing models of behavior. Consider the basic characteristics of traditional heroes: sacrificing themselves for others, confronting evil, conquering tests of fortitude and temptation, suffering literal and/or figurative death, providing some form of renewal and redemption for their communities. Christ performs these acts in his story. So do Harry Potter, Dumbledore, Gandalf, Katniss Everdeen, and Buffy Summers. Bottom line: If you want to call every archetypal hero a Christ figure, then Christ is a Christ figure, so a student who identifies a literary character as such does nothing more than correctly point out the hero.\nMoreover, using the term “Christ figure” instead of archetypal or mythological hero limits what a student can say about a character. Christ’s story is, after all, pretty bereft of detail. If you want to attempt a penetrating analysis of a character’s martyrdom, for example, you’d be better served dealing with the character on its own terms and within its own context, especially with characters that embody more intricate motivations than Christ, because otherwise, in focusing on that one-to-one comparison, you are likely to miss some of the complexity.\nHere’s an easy example: Students like to argue that Sidney Carton in Dickens’s A Tale of Two Cities is a “Christ figure” because Carton makes a sacrifice [SPOILER] in going to the guillotine in place of his cousin Charles Darnay. The temptation to read this act as “Christ-like” derives from the martyrdom itself, of course, as well as the public execution aspect of that martyrdom, and the fact that Carton’s sacrifice is voluntary.", "score": 0.825633764, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:cba2e493-ab4f-4259-bd2b-24f166edd0a3>", "text": "The Messenger: As we read the Continue Reading →\nThe Saints and the Mystics of the Church What are saints but the heroes of faith?

It is not an aversion to miracles that makes me question whether the initial spread of Christianity was based on Jesus’ works and teachings. It is the historical fact that the most prolific writer and missionary of the early church says almost nothing about what Jesus said or did. Paul’s theology seems to be based exclusively on his personal interpretation of the meaning of Jesus’ death and resurrection In fact, all the first century letters, including Clement’s letter to the Corinthians, are practically bereft of references to anything Jesus himself taught or did. As a question of historical fact, most of what the first followers of Jesus believed about him isn't clear.\nSometimes I get charged with an anti-supernatural bias for questioning the traditional authorship of the gospels. I doubt that anyone thinks that non-belief in miracles causes English literature scholars to conclude that William Shakespeare didn't write all the plays that are attributed to him. Nevertheless, some Christians seem to think that such bias can be the only motive for doubting whether first-century Palestinian peasants could have written Greek as well as the authors of the gospels did. According to them, only an atheistic hyper-skeptic would doubt that Irenaeous actually had any evidential basis for identifying Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, as the authors of the canonical gospels a century after they were written.\nPerhaps scholars in all fields should consider the possibility of the supernatural in their work. Wouldn’t a little miraculous intervention go a long way to explain how an uneducated commoner became the Bard of Avon? Supernatural explanations could be a great boon to military historians. They would not longer have to reconcile contradictory accounts that put a key commander at two different places on the battlefield. Simply invoke the supernatural and he’s at both places at the same time.\nChristian apologists like to claim that allowing for the supernatural best explains all the evidence about Jesus of Nazareth, but I don’t think that this is true. It is the historian who applies methodological naturalism who has to find an explanation for the fantastic stories that are found in the gospels.

Oscar Romero was a hero of the Catholic faith and the Salvadoran people. I have no doubt that he was murdered by soldiers in retaliation against what he bravely stood for, namely, Christian charity toward all. And I have no reasonable doubt that he is or is destined (hedging only because God works outside of time, so I am not sure what “now” and “later” exactly mean here) to enjoy eternal life with God.\nBearing that in mind, I thought that Pope Benedict XVI shared these basic views but was cautious about calling Romeo a “martyr” because the archbishop’s political enemies were clearly behind his murder—a view I thought at the time missed the central point. So what if the archbishop’s political enemies wanted him dead? Murder can still be martyrdom if, among other things, it is done in odium Fidei, regardless of whether other motives contributed to the deed. A pontifical commission seems to have reached this conclusion, too. I think they are, in that respect, correct.\nBut there is another question about the alleged martyrdom of Romero that I don’t see being squarely faced: traditionally, a martyr makes a choice to accept death instead of renouncing the faith. That is not quite the same thing as one’s being murdered because someone else hates the Faith. The martyr knows that death is not an abstract possibility but that it is facing him right here, right now, and that he can escape that death by renouncing the Faith right here, right now. My question about Romero’s murder, then, is whether his being ambushed at Mass satisfies that criterion of martyrdom. Yes, the man of God was gunned down because he proclaimed Christ in the midst of chaos—that, and other things of course, make him a saint. But does simply being murdered because someone hates our Catholic Faith make one a martyr?\nI don’t know.\nNow, maybe the traditional understanding of martyrdom is not as cut and dried as I have come to understand it; if so, scholars can clarify that misunderstanding for us. Or, maybe the traditional understanding of martyrdom is not adequate for today’s complex world; if so, the Church can modify her understanding of martyrdom.

Christian originated from the Latin word “Christianus” which means, not surprisingly, ‘follower of Christ.’ The Greek name, “Khristos” is a translation of the Hebrew term “Messiah,” meaning ‘anointed.’ The name Christian as a given name has been in use throughout Europe since the Middle Ages, although it was typically a girl’s name back then (such as in the German Christianne). Christian eventually became more of a male name in modern times, and Cristian as a spelling mutation occurred very recently.\nPopularity of the Name Cristian\nThe name Cristian (without the “H”) first appeared on the U.S. popularity charts in 1977, right as the name Christian was achieving its greatest success. As a boy’s name, Christian has been in use in America for well over 100 years. Even though it’s sometimes thought of as a unisex name, it’s far more given to little boys than girls. Names like Christine, Kristin, etc. are now predominantly used for the young ladies. Cristian feels like a more modern, updated version of Christian, and by taking out the H the name becomes much more secular. It also appears that Cristian is the Spanish form of the name Christian (along with Cristiano).\nPopularity of the Boy Name Cristian\nYou need Adobe Flash Player 6 (or above) to view the charts.

The two views (neither of which can be substantiated) would appear to be incompatible.\nAs for Peter, we know nothing of his death from any first-century source other than the last chapter of the fourth Gospel. He is described in John 21:18 only as being led where he would not want to go. The unverified tradition of him being crucified upside down dates from the end of the second century, almost 150 years after his death.\nCentral to the idea of Peter and Paul’s martyrdom is Clement’s use of a term translated in English as “witness” or “testimony.” The word is read by many to mean “martyrdom.” But its use to convey that meaning appears to be absent from any other first-century source. The term is used frequently throughout the New Testament, however, to convey the idea of a testimony or a witness. It wasn’t until after Clement’s time, in the later second century, that it came to mean “martyrdom.” In light of the literary structure of Clement’s epistle, it would be safer to read the term as meaning “a spoken witness” or “a testimony.”\nWhy, then, should we find so much being read into this section of Clement?\nFrom the subsequent century we read accounts of the leaders of other sects or heresies being in Rome. Justin Martyr, a citizen of Rome, reported that the heretic Simon Magus came to his city; yet he was totally silent on Peter’s alleged presence there. Marcion, another heretic, is said to have spent time in Rome. Add to this Valentinus, a leading teacher of a sect that today is classified as Gnostic.", "score": 0.003881779116359339, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:c2f75fb5-2ce2-45b0-b9a2-8b067c615998>", "text": "One Life to Live Transcript Wednesday 1/13/10\nPLEASE CLICK TO DONATE TO OUR SITE!!!!\nEpisode # 10603 ~ Family is Everything\nProvided By Suzanne\nProofread By Kathy\nCristian: Hey, what are you doing here?\nLayla: Are you just getting up?\nCristian: Yeah.

So I have been looking very carefully at IEH Vol 3, Section 8.23. If I can be so presumptious as to question the \"old master,\" I have serious problems with the control scheme for two variable speed pumps serving multiple users, utilizing valve position control.\nMy problem originates with the fact that the pump-system curves at the top of Figure 8.23pp shows a single \"system curve.\" Actually, I believe the system curve varies, depending upon the demand being made by the non-selected users.\nConsider the \"minimum system curve\" to be when all users valves are at 90% -- this presents the minimum restriction to flow.\nConsider the \"maximum system curve\" to be when the user with the smallest control valve has the valve at 90% open, and all control valves are closed. This presents the maximum restriction to flow.\nA \"typical operating system curve\" lies between these two extremes, and varies, depending upon that the demands are of all the users. A typical operating system curve may not even span the capacity of one pump, therefore it would be impossible to switch back from two pumps to one pump at 90% of flow capacity of one pump. I believe that you can only switch number of pumps based upon speed. If one pump is in operation and you reach its maximum speed, then start the second pump. If two pumps are in operation and you reach an (arbitrary setting) minimum speed point, then stop the second pump.\nIn either case, you need a feedforward signal to avoid bumping the discharge pressure. Since the feedforward signal can be either positive or negative, depending upon whether you are going from one-to-two pumps, or from two-to-one pump, the circuitry has to be a bit more complex that is shown in your diagrams.\nIn the figures below I describe what I think is a workable control system. If you have time (I envision your spending every waking hour getting out IEH Vol 4), I would appreciate your comments, and corrections if any of my concepts are in error.\nFIGURE 1: PUMP AND SYSTEM CURVES\nTrue, the extremes that I mentioned would probably not be encountered in actual practice.

In addition, they may also be associated with noise or have inherent stochasticity in their outputs. As a result, the optimization of black-box systems is far from straightforward. The inability to directly model the problem as a mathematical program, the lack of derivative information, and therefore the nebulous notions of optimality further contribute to the challenge.\nOur approach involves the use of modern experiment design and regression methods derived from machine learning and statistical theory in combination with deterministic global optimization methods.

If an engineer were to look back in his notes on MCU power consumption they would find something along the lines of\nPower = Constant * Frequency * Voltage Squared + Current Load * Voltage\nA quick look at this equation gets really exciting because with a voltage squared term we could save a lot of power by taking advantage of the exponential! Or at least that is the way it looks. When working with battery operated devices what the developer is really going after is current. How can a systems current consumption be lowered?\nNow this power equation still plays an important role in this endeavor. Power after all is\nPower = Current * Voltage / Time\nCreating a quick substitution for power shows\nCurrent * Voltage / Time = Constant * Frequency * Voltage Squared + Current Load * Voltage\nSimplifying so that the equation is representative of current over time results in\nCurrent / Time = Constant * Frequency * Voltage + Current Load\nWhen optimizing for lowest power, the current draw of the load is not going to be something that can be adjusted. That leaves the engineer with only two parameters than can be adjusted; a linear frequency relationship and a linear voltage relationship. An excerpt from an MCU datasheet shows this linear relationship between current draw and supply voltage below:\nReviewing the math and examining the plot reveals that adjusting the voltage supply does only decrease current consumption linearly and in fact only by a very little amount at best.

Our aim is to obtain the optimal solution of the nonlinear optimal control problem. Since the structures of both problems are dierent, only solving the model-based optimal control problem will not give the optimal solution of the nonlinear optimal control problem. In our approach, the adjusted parameters are added into the model used so as the dierences between the real plant and the model can be measured. On this basis, an expanded optimal control problem is introduced, where system optimization and parameter estimation are integrated interactively. The Hamiltonian function, which adjoins the cost function, the state equation and the additional constraints, is dened. By applying the calculus of variation, a set of the necessary optimality conditions, which denes modied model-based optimal control problem, parameter estimation problem and computation of modiers, is then derived. To obtain the optimal solution, the modied model-based optimal control problem is converted in a nonlinear programming problem through the canonical formulation, where the gradient formulation can be made. During the iterative procedure, the control sequences are generated as the admissible control law of the model used, together with the corresponding state sequences. Consequently, the optimal solution is updated repeatedly by the adjusted parameters. At the end of iteration, the converged solution approaches to the correct optimal solution of the original optimal control problem in spite of model-reality dierences. For illustration, two examples are studied and the results show the eciency of the approach proposed.\nShowing items related by title, author, creator and subject.\nEfficient Output Solution for Nonlinear Stochastic Optimal Control Problem with Model-Reality DifferencesKek, S.L.; Teo, Kok Lay; Aziz, M.

The approximation to the stable manifold of the deterministic system is based on the Hartman-Grobman theorems for dynamic systems, whereas the use of that approximation in the stochastic problem assumes “certainty equivalence,” that is, that the decision rules for the deterministic problem are the same (or close to) the decision rules for the stochastic problem. Unfortunately, the quality of any linear approximation (before or after a nonlinear change of variables) breaks down as the state deviates from the steady state. Higher order perturbation methods will improve the approximation near the deterministic steady state but will surely create stability problems at states sufficiently far away.\nI will describe linearization (and log-linearization) in a precise mathematical fashion, discuss optimal control methods for solving dynamic optimization problems with arbitrary initial states, describe a method for using solutions to the optimal control problems to compute the globally valid solutions for the deterministic problem, and the compare the performance of the global certainty equivalence solution to the local certainty equivalent solution that now dominates macroeconomic modeling.\n2: Stabilizing Iterative Methods for Solving Equations\nNonlinear systems of equations are usually solved by some form of iteration — Gauss-Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel, SOR methods, etc. — that are intuitively based on tatonnement and best reply “stories.” Iterative methods often have convergence problems. Convergence often requires some appropriate reformulation of the iterative process. I will present some simple examples where the economics indicates the appropriate reformulation. There is no generally valid method. The goal here is to give you a conceptual foundation for finding a convergent iteration process.\n3: Numerical Solution of Polynomial Systems of Equations\nHigh quality (and low cost) software for solving polynomial systems has become available in the past year.

Computational experiments are also typically conducted on a variety of systems, ranging from commodity laptops to large-scale clusters with many thousands of nodes. Even small changes in how specific constraints are modeled or which constraints are considered can have significant implications for algorithm selection and performance as well as solution quality. Electrification was chosen as the greatest achievement of the 20th century by the National Academy of Engineering based on technical achievements for one of the most complex engineered systems that then forms a backbone for any modern society. A new paradigm for the testing and evaluation of emerging software solutions is needed to accelerate the adoption of transformational technologies for this critical and complex engineered system.\nIn response, ARPA-E has announced the GO Competition. The goal of the GO Competition is to accelerate the development of transformational and disruptive methods for solving the most pressing power system problems. The GO Competition will be staged as a series of challenges in power systems to address emerging needs and new technologies on the grid. Challenge 1 focused on security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF). With this competition, ARPA-E aims to provide fair and transparent comparisons of industrially-relevant algorithm performance on high-fidelity, open-access, large-scale power system models and a platform for the identification of transformational and disruptive methods for solving power system optimization problems.\nThe optimal power flow (OPF) problem is the central optimization challenge underlying a large suite of grid planning and operational tools. Simply stated, the OPF problem is that of finding the optimal dispatch and control settings for power generation, flexible customer demand, energy storage, and grid control equipment that maximize one or more grid objectives, while the SCOPF problem additionally considers security constraints.,, In order to be deployable, the recommended settings must satisfy all physical constraints of electric power infrastructure and applicable operating standards. These standards include, but are not limited to, minimum and maximum voltages at each node (bus), minimum and maximum power generation from each generator, thermal transmission constraints, proxy stability constraints, and constraints to ensure the reliability of the system while responding to unexpected events and outages (i.e., contingencies).", "score": 0.018084481283269237, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:fac7513d-b8ad-4d80-9b4d-24cd4559fc94>", "text": "Building on RING, we have developed a multi-scale systems engineering framework for biomass conversion processes, which encompasses chemistry elucidation, simultaneous product design and chemistry selection, process design, and supply chain optimization to determine optimal facility locations, technologies and capacities.\nOn a different front, microgrids are autonomous power systems, which use distributed generation and storage units and allow for high penetration of renewable power.

An engineer or scientist conjures up a new idea and optimization improves on that idea. Optimization consists in trying variations on an initial concept and using the information gained to improve on the idea. A computer is the perfect tool for optimization as long as the idea or variable influencing the idea can be input in electronic format. Feed the computer some data and out comes the solution.\nThe terminology “best” solution implies that there is more than one solution and the solutions are not of equal value. The definition of best is relative to the problem at hand, its method of solution, and the tolerances allowed. Thus the optimal solution depends on the person formulating the problem. Education, opinions, bribes, and amount of sleep are factors influencing the definition of best. Optimization plays a crucial role in various disciplines in sciences, industry, engineering, and almost in every aspect of the daily life. Optimization problems are encountered, for example, in communication systems , antenna design , semiconductors manufacturing , aerodynamics , transportation and traffic , nuclear reactor design , medicine , and economics .\nOptimization occupies a fundamental position in engineering design and applications, since the classical function of the engineer is to design new, better, or more efficient and less expensive systems as well as to advise planes and procedures for the improved operation of exiting systems . The application of optimization methods to engineering problems requires the selection of the problem decision variables that are adequate to characterize the possible candidate designs or operating conditions of the system, the definition of the objective function on the basis of which candidates will be ranked to determine the best solution, and the definition of a model that describes the manner in which the problem variables are related and the way in which the performance criterion is influenced by the variables. The problem's model normally includes a set of equality constraints, inequality constrains, and some bounds for the variables. In its most general case, the optimization problem involves the determination of the optimal set decision variables of a given objective function in the presence of some constraints. In the context of optimization, the “best” will always mean the candidate system with either the minimum or maximum value of the objective function.\nOptimization problems can be divided into two categories depending on whether the solution is continuous or discrete. An optimization problem with discrete solution is known as a conventional optimization problem, while the continuous version is known as a continuous optimization problem.", "score": 0.0017479229246998647, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:4da510db-65bf-44dc-bf7d-b2ce27a9c842>", "text": "Services on Demand\n- Cited by SciELO\n- Access statistics\nBrazilian Journal of Chemical Engineering\nPrint version ISSN 0104-6632On-line version ISSN 1678-4383\nLOBATO, F.

In this paper, the differential-algebraic approach is incorporated into a hybrid method, extending the concepts of structural and differential indexes, consistent initialization analysis, index reduction and dynamic degrees of freedom to the optimal control problem. The resultant differential-algebraic optimal control problem is solved in the following steps: transformation of the original problem into a standard nonlinear programming problem that provides control and state variables, switching time estimates and costate variables profiles with the DIRCOL code; definition of the switching function and the automatically generated sequence of index-1 differential-algebraic boundary value problems from Pontryagins minimum principle by using the developed Otima code; and finally, application of the COLDAE code with the results of the direct method as an initial guess. The proposed hybrid method is illustrated with a pressure-constrained batch reactor optimization problem associated with the slack variable method.\nKeywords : Optimal control; Differential - algebraic equations [Hybrid method].", "score": 0.0003415224655689961, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:1bb3dc3e-6175-40b3-bd35-e82821691363>", "text": "The School has many industry sponsored advanced laboratories for doing research.

This assessment aims to identify any deviations from the norm, understand the underlying physiological processes of diseases, and develop a holistic care plan tailored to meet the patient’s individual needs. In this assignment, we will perform a holistic health assessment on an adult individual and interpret the findings in line with pathophysiologic disease states. Furthermore, we will create a teaching plan that addresses the individual holistically based on the assessment data analyzed. Finally, we will prepare a PowerPoint presentation for patient teaching.\nHolistic Health Assessment Data:\nTo perform a holistic health assessment, it is essential to utilize a combination of subjective and objective data collection methods. Subjective data refers to information provided by the patient through interviews or questionnaires, while objective data pertains to observations made by the nurse through physical examinations and laboratory tests.\nDuring the subjective data collection phase of the holistic health assessment, it is crucial to establish a rapport with the patient to ensure open communication and trust. By actively listening and asking open-ended questions, the nurse can obtain detailed information about the patient’s health history, current symptoms, and their impact on the patient’s daily life. For example, in this case, the patient reports experiencing frequent headaches accompanied by dizziness, photophobia, and nausea. Additionally, the patient mentions feeling fatigued and having difficulty concentrating.\nObjective data collection involves physical examinations, diagnostic tests, and observations made by the nurse. In this case, the nurse performs a thorough physical examination, including vital signs assessment, palpation, percussion, and auscultation. Upon examination, the nurse identifies pulsating temporal arteries and tender neck muscles. The patient’s blood pressure reading is elevated, and bilateral papilledema is observed upon fundoscopic examination. These objective findings suggest the possibility of an underlying condition, such as temporal arteritis or raised intracranial pressure.\nInterpretation of Findings:\nTo interpret the findings obtained from the holistic health assessment, it is essential to understand the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying common disease states. In this case, the patient’s symptoms, including headaches, dizziness, photophobia, and nausea, along with objective findings of elevated blood pressure and bilateral papilledema, point towards a potential diagnosis of intracranial hypertension.", "score": 0.828414381, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:d3c55c92-847e-4616-b0ca-86090c721e86>", "text": "Introduction to Healthcare Data Science (Overview)\nHealthcare analytics is the collection and analysis of data in the healthcare field in order to study determinants of disease in human populations, identify and mitigate risk by predicting outcomes. This post introduces some common epidemiological study designs and overview of modern healthcare data analytics process.\nTypes of Epidemiologic Studies\nIn general, epidemiologic studies can be classified into 3 types: Interventional study, Observational study, Meta-analysis study\nInterventional or Randomized control study\nClinical medicine relies on evidence base found in strong research to inform best practices and improve clinical care. The gold-standard for study design to provide evidence is Randomized control (RCT). The main idea of this kind of research is to prove the root cause that makes a certain disease happen or causal effect of a treatment. RCTs are performed in fairly homogeneous patient populations when participants are allocated by chance to two similar groups. The researchers then try with different interventions or treatments to these two groups and compare the outcomes.\nAs an example, a study was conducted to assess whether improved lifestyle habits could reduce hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels of employees. In the experiment, the intervention consisted of a 3-month competition among employees to adopt healthier lifestyle habits (Eat better, Move more, and Quit smoking) or keep their current lifestyle. After the intervention, employees with elevated HbA1c significantly reduced their HbA1c levels while employees without elevated HbA1c levels of employees without intervention was not changed.\nIn ideal conditions, there are no confounding variables in a randomized experiment, thus RCTs are often designed to investigate causal relationship between exposure and outcome. However, RCTs have several limitations, RCTs are often costly, time-intensive, labor-intensive, slow, and can consist of homogeneous patients that are seldom generalizable to every patient population.\nUnlike RCTs, Observational studies have no active interventions which means the researchers do not interfere with their participants. In contrast with interventional studies, observations studies are usually performed in heterogeneous patient populations. In these studies, researchers often define an outcome of interest (e.g a disease) and use data collected on patients such as demographic, labs, vital signs, and disease states to explore the relationship between exposures and outcome, determine which factors contributed to the outcome and attempt to draw inferences about the effects of different exposures on the outcome.", "score": 0.824246883, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:9d81a82e-1c5a-4316-891c-a2c19b47299e>", "text": "The extracted data included:\n(1) the sample size, (2) the criteria applied to exclude individuals whose EMF-attributed symptoms may be explained by somatic diseases or mental disorders, (3) the method used to identify exposure sources and situations that are associated with the symptoms, (4) the method used to identify the types of symptoms experienced in everyday life, (5) the method used to verify the contrast in severity of symptoms between situations with and without exposure, (6) the method used to assess how quickly symptoms appear and how long they last, (7) the type of exposure source, the frequency range and the exposure level used in the experimental sessions and the duration of exposures, (8) the interval between two consecutive exposure trials, (9) the number of repetitions of each exposure condition, (10) the types of recorded symptoms and the tools used to record the symptoms in the experimental sessions, (11) the assessment times for querying the symptoms in the experimental sessions, (12) the method and level of blinding, (13) the methods used to minimize biases related to the sequence and to the period of the exposure conditions (e.g., randomization, counterbalancing), (14) the methods used to control for co-variates that might bias the outcome, (15) the method used to control and minimize the background exposure level, (16) the method used to control the emission level from the exposure source and/or the exposure level, (17) the level of completeness of the data that were included in the analysis, (18) the number of participants that withdrew from the study and at which stages, (19) the results reported, (20) the level of completeness of the reported outcomes, (21) the statistical power estimates, and (22) the method applied to adjust for multiple comparisons when relevant.\nRisk of bias and imprecision assessment\nThe extracted data provided the basis for assessing the methodological quality of the included studies in terms of risk of bias and imprecision.

Electronic health records contain large amounts of longitudinal data and a wealth of detailed clinical information. Thus, the data, if properly analyzed and meaningfully interpreted, could vastly improve our conception and development of best practices. Common data in EHR are listed as the following:\nAge, gender, occupation, marital status, ethnicity\nSBP, DBP, Height, Weight, BMI, waist circumference\nStature, sitting height, elbow width, weight, subscapular, triceps skinfold measurement\nCreatinine, hemoglobin, white blood cell count (WBC), total cholesterol, cholesterol, triglyceride, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT)\nfrequency in urination, skin rash, stomachache, cough\nMedical history and Family diseases\ndiabetes, traumas, dyslipidemia, hypertension, cancer, heart diseases, stroke, diabetes, arthritis, etc\nBehavior risk factors from Questionnaires such as Physical activity, dietary habit, smoking, drinking alcohol, sleeping, diet, nutritional habits, cognitive function, work history and digestive health, etc\nMedications (prescriptions, dose, timing), procedures, etc.\nUsing EHR to Conduct Outcome and Health Services Research\nIn the secondary analysis, the process of analyzing data often includes steps:\n- Problem Understanding and Formulating the Research Question: In this step, the process of transforming a clinical question into research is defined. There are 3 key components of research question: the study sample (or patient cohort), the exposure of interest (e.g., information about patient demographic, lifestyle habit, medical history, regular health checkup test result) and the outcome of interest (e.g., a patient has diabetes or not after 5 years):\n- Data Preparation and Integration: Extracted raw data can be collected from different data sources, or be in separate datasets with different representation and formats.", "score": 0.820976496, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:896a725d-1d85-425c-8982-5c2c61cd52ec>", "text": "We also provide guidance regarding various issues encountered with efficacy assessments e.g., baseline comparisons, the proper treatment of dropout and missing data (intention to treat per protocol, last observation, multiple imputation), and covariate adjustment (demographic or baseline measurements, or concomitant therapies, data monitoring).

Assistance is also available for monitoring and group sequential procedures for interim analyses, special analyses for multicenter studies, quality of life assessments, and analyses of safety data (e.g., extent of exposure, coding and analysis of adverse events and laboratory data).\nEpidemiology. Biostatistical methods can be applied to analyze epidemiological data and identify risk factors (e.g., demographic, risk exposures, behavioral) related to the occurrence and distribution of infectious or chronic disease. Regardless of the study design (open or closed cohort, case control, etc.), we will apply the most appropriate method to identify risk factors and interactions while controlling for extraneous or confounding factors. Appropriate techniques can be applied for closed cohort data (e.g., binomial, odds ratios for stratified and unstratified data, risk difference methods), survival or open cohort data (e.g., proportional hazards models, and Kaplan-Meier, actuarial, and Poisson methods), and case control data (e.g., odds ratio methods for open and closed cohorts, methods for matched data). We can properly calculate standardized rates, and apply logistic regression (e.g., for a closed cohort study with a continuous exposure variable), Cox proportional hazards models (e.g., for an open cohort study where exposure is dichotomous and separate hazard functions are produced for the exposed and unexposed cohorts), and Mantel-Haenszel tests and estimates.\nHealth Care Administration. We can conduct evaluations of health policies and patient satisfaction, secondary analysis of large scale medical databases through the application of data mining, and assist with analyses of clinical protocols, chart reviews, audits of data, and transcriptions.

First, item content was determined by combined expert and patient input, ensuring that clinically important issues relevant to patients are included. Second, there are several hundred publications detailing its performance, many of which are reports of formal validation studies. Thus, there is a deep reference literature to which one can compare results. A third advantage to FACIT is the availability of normative and cross-illness comparative scores to which one can relate results. Finally, a growing body of research has illustrated clinically significant differences and changes in scores in FACIT scales, aiding in study sample size determination and interpretation of study results.\nHow was the FACIT developed and validated?\nMost FACIT measures have undergone a standard scale development and validation methodology, which takes place in four phases: item generation, item-reduction, scale construction, and psychometric evaluation [1-22]. The scale development process involves considerable input from patients and expert health care providers, using a semi-structured interview designed to elicit personal experiences and educated opinions about how a disease, treatment, or condition may affect physical status, emotional well-being, functional well-being, family /social issues, sexuality/intimacy, work status, and future orientation. This process yields an exhaustive list of candidate items, which then undergo a series of reviews and reductions based on patient and expert ratings and item quality. A finite set of targeted concerns are then derived. Final candidate items are formatted with response choices compatible with a 5-point Likert-type scale, and appended to the FACT-G.\nNewly constructed FACIT subscales then undergo an initial assessment of reliability and validity using a sample of at least 50 patients. The validation design typically involves patient completion of a baseline assessment, a test-retest assessment 3–7 days later, and a third assessment 2–3 months later to demonstrate sensitivity to change over time. Relevant sociodemographic and treatment data is also collected and a battery of other measures administered at the baseline and 2–3 month retest to help determine convergent and divergent validity. A comprehensive analysis of the data gathered (including item response theory modeling when sample size allows) yields useful psychometric information and establishes initial reliability and validity of the scale.\nWhich language translations are available?", "score": 0.818743169, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:7b3bf825-fba5-46b6-89fe-7047a3b03653>", "text": "The Healthcare Enterprise Data Warehouse Component\nA healthcare EDW is a database that extracts data from transactional application databases (source systems). The EDW pulls data from the source systems into one central repository, or single source of truth. The repository is optimized for and dedicated to analytics. Because the EDW’s architecture is constructed to efficiently read and retrieve large data sets and aggregate data, users can create and manage data sets across a wide range of source systems (e.g., clinical, research, human resources, and billing). This eliminates the performance burden that an analytics application places on a source system.\nEDWs also provide users with the flexibility to determine which data to report depending on their needs. For example, an analytics application for quality improvement might contain data from several source systems, such as clinical, patient satisfaction, and costing. An application for operational purposes, however, might contain staffing levels and clinical data.\nThe EDW’s capabilities are particularly critical when discussing complex healthcare data, with many data elements being highly variable (e.g., calculating length of stay (LOS) or defining patient admission, discharge, or transfer rules). In addition, each patient’s visit with a provider has many conditional data points associated with it. For example, a physician typically sees patients who have had multiple encounters with multiple caregivers, multiple diagnoses, multiple procedures, and multiple results. For one visit alone, a blood pressure reading requires documentation of several data elements, such as:\n- Systolic numbers\n- Diastolic numbers\n- Date of visit\n- Time of visit\n- Type of blood pressure device\n- Whether the patient was standing, sitting, or lying down\nDespite an EDW’s tremendous computing power to manage large, complicated data models, however, without analytics applications or a BI visualization tool, analysts must rely on software solutions such as Access or Excel, which only largely produce numerical, data-heavy reports. While these types of software provide limited functionality for healthcare’s massive data stores, there are significant downsides to using such non-centralized solutions. For example, analysts spend most of their time tracking down data from various source systems rather than analyzing it. This creates delays in the reporting of timely information, increases expenses, and limits analysts’ ability to provide accurate, real-time data analysis. In addition, these tools lack the ability to convert rows upon rows and columns upon columns of patient data into meaningful visual representations that are easy for the human brain to comprehend.", "score": 0.818058729, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:7d021725-9493-48b5-9029-2396c5f7a10f>", "text": "We expect to find different types of context-dependent workarounds in each of these processes. The preparation and data collection procedures per process are explained in the following subsections.\nProcess 1: Preparation of Outpatient Consultation\nThe first process concerns health care professionals preparing outpatient visits while using the EHR in their private offices. When preparing outpatient consultations an EHR user (eg, physician or nurse) primarily relies on the availability, retrievability, and quality of the data stored in the EHR by colleagues and the user him/herself, as important clinical information is often hidden in a sea of data . Patients will not be present in this setting and the system user will not have direct interactions with other colleagues on site, so opportunistic questions may be asked during direct observations of users interacting with the EHR. Furthermore, users will be asked to explain how they use and navigate the EHR to provide richer insight into their actions. After the observed session, a semistructured interview will be conducted with the observed user to enrich the initial observations.\nProcess 2: Actual Outpatient Consultation\nThe second process of an outpatient consultation concerns obtaining the medical history from patients, conducting a physical examination, and ordering laboratory tests or medication while a health care professional uses the EHR in a designated examination room. Since these activities are regularly carried out in a limited time frame per patient, the ratio between provider-system and provider-patient interaction demands careful balancing [- ]. Furthermore, unexpected complexity of tasks at hand may dictate workflow or EHR-functionality issues, may cause no correct path situations when a desired option does not exist in the system workflow, or spark data organization issues when a user would prefer a different overview of existing data (eg, historical patient data) [ ]. Despite such issues, the user must still devise a way to accomplish his or her intentions within the given time frame; this likely gives rise to workarounds. Similar to the first process to be studied, a semistructured interview will be conducted after the observed session of the user interacting with the EHR in the presence of the patient.\nProcess 3: Actual Inpatient Consultation\nThe third and final setting concerns health care professionals using the EHR after having made inpatient ward rounds.

Consistent with Q methodology, major and replication samples were purposively selected, each consisting of 30 medical-surgical inpatients of both sexes, ranging from 24 to 75 years of age. Instruments used were the Client Control Q Set, Health Opinion Survey (HOS), a demographic data form, and a semi-structured interview. Q factor analysis and the construction of factor arrays resulted in three dimensions of client control in the original data set which replicated and were supported by interview and HOS data. These orthogonal dimensions were: knowing and fulfilling the patient role, being involved in making decisions, and directing interpersonal and environmental components. A theme common to all dimensions was the importance patients attached to having cognitive control over diagnostic tests, surgery, and treatment and to understanding concomitant life-style implications.

An additional aim was to study the relationships between some of these variables. On admission to an acute care hospital in Sweden, 25 HIV-positive men were consecutively included in the study. Medical data, anthropometric variables such as weight, height, body mass index (BMI) and percentage weight loss were studied. The following instruments were used: the subjective global assessment (SGA) was used to determine nutritional status; the oral assessment guide (OAG) was used for subjective assessment of the oral cavity; and the numeric rating scale (NRS) was used to assess the symptoms experienced. The Health Index (HI) was used to evaluate general state of health. The results showed that more than half of the patients had suspected/severe malnutrition; between 48% and 72% complained of moderate to severe symptoms of various kinds.

This has been supported by the recent cross-funder investment to establish the Farr Institute, a network of academic eHealth Centres of Excellence [ ].\nThere is a reasonable expectation in society that the sensitive and personal nature of health care data requires that it should be carefully managed and access to it should be restricted only to those with a legitimate purpose. As a consequence, the UK legal regime has conditions for the use of health care data but at the same time allows certain exemptions for research carried out in the public interest. Under the Data Protection Act (1998), patient consent is not required when anonymized data are used for research, although there may be societal concerns that “go beyond compliance with the requirements of formal regulation” .

Providers are often overwhelmed by the amount of clinical, research and social data available to them, and many companies are responding to physicians’ distress signals by developing extraction tools and analytics that leverage this data to derive insights about patients.\nAs we’ve reported in the past, the cognitive computing platform, Watson Health, is certainly a major player in this quest to make sense of the massive amount of exogenous medical data available. Through strategic acquisitions and partnerships, Watson Health is intent on using the power of data to do things like help cancer patients determine the best course of treatment, or help diabetes patients manage their illness more effectively.\nDr. Paul Tang, Watson’s new Chief Health Transformation Officer, has a new idea for how this data can be used.\nAccording to Tang, Watson’s cognitive computing platform may provide physicians with a unique opportunity to “personalize” healthcare. Unlike personalized medicine—which involves considering genomic data to devise patient-specific treatment plans—Tang’s vision of personalized healthcare involves knowing more about the individual patient than is in their record alone, such as their behaviors, demographic and personal life goals.\nHis hope is that Watson will facilitate a patient-provider partnership that takes into account information about the patient’s everyday life, and individual health goals, when choosing a care pathway. According to Tang, personalized healthcare will consider a patient’s personal health behaviors—collected, perhaps, from connected devices or wearables—in the context of a variety of care pathways taken by other, similar patients. “Wouldn’t it be nice if I knew what other patients did, and what happened to them if they took this path or that path?” asks Tang. “If I could sit down with a patient and we could look at the possible trajectories, rather than, say, ‘oh you have diabetes, here’s what we do for all people with diabetes,” says Tang.\nTang’s vision for the future of healthcare also includes leveraging technology to help patients make the right choices by giving them beneficial information at the point of need. “Patients have all kinds of questions that come up that are related to their health,” explains Tang. “I think we as healthcare professionals should be right there when that happens, not when you make a random appointment with us.”\nOne way that Watson Health’s will help to achieve this aim by making apps smarter.", "score": 0.039414618157476454, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:3dbe7d74-69cc-4196-adb4-c6a169a35e0b>", "text": "If the final report is to be used for lobbying, the quantitative data and qualitative data together are very powerful.

E cigarettes or vaporizers have grown to be very popular over modern times. It comes in different sizes and shapes, incorporating many customizable features. Regarded as a slick tobacco alternative, it appeals to both young and old alike.\nHowever, the most recent addition to the tobacco scene, is the e-cigs, or electronic cigarettes, which are very similar to the traditional cigarettes, but usually do not contain any of the harmful chemical compounds found in regular cigarettes. This means that there are less health threats associated with e-juice in comparison to regular smoking, which is a healthier alternative. But, are there any e-liquid health threats?\nAccording to experts, you can find e-juice and vaporing health risks, depending on how often and just how much is used. Vaping allows the user to remove unwanted toxins, such as nicotine, from their bodies. However, too much or too frequent use can be hazardous to your health. Excessive or prolonged use can result in several complications, including coronary disease, blood pressure problems, cancer, and even death.\nWhen working with e-juices, it is best for smokers to start off by using them in a very low dose, to be able to prevent any serious nicotine overdose, which might lead to many other complications. Nicotine is really a highly addictive substance, which includes the opportunity to give smokers the feeling that they are high throughout the entire session. The only problem is, cigarettes have tar and carbon monoxide in its ingredients, alongside hundreds of other chemicals, which can prove to be harmful to the user’s lungs.\nThe consequences of long-term e-smoking include damaging to the respiratory system, referred to as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). COPD results in difficulty in breathing due to congestion of the airways. Chronic bronchitis is really a life-threatening condition, which can also be developed in long-term smokers. Additionally, lung cancer can develop in long-term smokers.\nTHE WEB is a good resource to be sure of potential dangers of e-cigs. There have been several reports of popcorn and other flavored e cigarette products causing cancer and respiratory problems. These products are not regulated exactly the same way as regular cigarettes and really should be treated accordingly. Most health officials have spoken out against flavored vapes for that reason.", "score": 0.865899861, "source": "dense"}]}

Rembrandt Harmensz. van Rijn (Dutch, 1606–1669).\nOil on single oak panel. The J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles.\nLaunched last year with 17 museums in Europe, New York, and Washington D.C., the Google Art Project allows museums to share their collections with visitors all over the world. With a few clicks, visitors to the site can explore the galleries of many of the world’s greatest museums, pausing before objects to explore them in greater detail. They can also dig deeper into a museum’s collection by learning more about objects that may not always be on view, such as works on paper, which are sensitive to light.\nThrough the Getty’s presence on Google Art Project, visitors can examine more than 3,000 objects from the Museum’s collection, and virtually wander its galleries. In particular, Rembrandt van Rijn’s masterpiece painting The Abduction of Europa (1632) is available in breathtaking close-up in a Gigapixel image, allowing viewers to see brushwork and patina in far greater detail than the human eye could detect.\n“The Google Art Project is a powerful portal to make museum collections around the world more accessible to a broader audience. We are thrilled to be a part of Art Project and to have our collections joined with those of other museums to the benefit of the public. Such endeavors will only serve to enhance the museum experience and to increase curiosity about the world’s artistic legacy,” said Jim Cuno, president and CEO of the J. Paul Getty Trust.\nTo put the Getty Museum’s galleries online, a specially designed Street View trolley captured 360-degree images of the galleries, enabling online visitors to smoothly navigate from one room to the next as if they were walking through the museum.\nUsers can browse the collections of participating museums by artist, artwork, type of art, museum, country, city and collection. Users can also create their own personalized galleries with favorite images from museums all over the world, which they can share with friends.\nThis is the Getty’s second prominent partnership with Google.

Carbohydrate is metabolised into glucose in the body. Glucose maintains blood sugar at normal levels, is the energy for the brain and can be stored as muscle glycogen. Athletes can maximise muscle glycogen storage by increasing dietary carbohydrate intake. This is called \"Carbohydrate Loading\".\nCarbohydrate loading is suitable for events which last longer than 90 minutes, like cycling, marathon, triathlon, and events which have more than one game in a day, especially those which game time is long or unpredictable, like windsurfing, badminton, soccer, squash, tennis etc.\nHowever, carbohydrate loading is not suitable for short and power-related events, like short putt, high jump, sprint, weight lifting, shooting, bowling etc.\nWhere is the glucose stored?\nA sedentary person has 13 grams of glycogen per kilogram muscle, but an athlete can have 32 grams of glycogen per kilogram muscle. Carbohydrate loading can increase glycogen storage to 35 - 40 grams of glycogen per kilogram muscle.\nThe traditional method for increasing muscle glycogen stores was introduced by Astrand in 1967. It was shown to be effective in prolonging endurance exercise and sports performance. Carbohydrate loading should be initiated seven days before the event. In the first four days, athletes should exercise to exhaustion and consume a low carbohydrate diet in order to deplete their muscle glycogen stores. Then, three days before the event, a high carbohydrate diet of 9-10g/kg body weight/day is consumed. For example, an athlete weighing 60kg needs to consume 540 - 600g carbohydrate per day three days before the event.At the same time, training needs to be decreased to lower energy expenditure in order to maximize stores.\nHowever, it is difficult to follow a low carbohydrate diet with high intensity training in the first four days. Athletes may experience overwhelming fatigue, irritability and poor immunity. It is unpleasant and may affect preparation for competition. Low carbohydrate intake and increased exercise intensity will deplete glycogen stores in the body, brain and muscles. It may result in muscle fatigue and even dizziness, which may increase the risk of injuries.", "score": 0.871711195, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:96a342ad-b1f6-4e7e-b133-b9beeddedca4>", "text": "So, they provide rich nourishment for our body which is really important for any tennis player.\nThis immensely help in replenishing their lost energy during their tennis matches.\nEven consuming bananas just before your match can keep your energy level high and your morale on the positive side.\nRecommended Articles for You:\n4.

Prevention of Constipation and Heartburn\nSome tennis players do have stomach digestion issues; specially in case of older players.\nSome of them do face other health problems such as heartburn and stomach ulcers.\nIn this case, bananas are great to consume during tennis matches.\nBecause due to their higher fiber and potassium content, they help in digesting your food faster.\nConsumption of bananas are also safe for heartburn and ulcer patients as they provide relief from their pain.\nThese are the main reasons why you should eat bananas instead of any other health supplements during your tennis matches.\nYou can further watch the following video to understand real health benefits of consuming bananas during and before tennis matches.", "score": 0.863223612, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:6dfa6aac-af0c-4bed-87f1-656b4bfc6f36>", "text": "If you are into endurance sport, at some stage you will hear the phrase “carbo-loading”. It sounds intriguing enough, so what exactly does it entail? We unpack what carbo-loading is and whether it can be beneficial to you.\nWhat exactly is carbo-loading?\nSimply put, it’s a strategy used primarily by endurance athletes to maximise the storage of glycogen (a fancy name for energy) in the muscles and liver.

It is important to remember that carbo-loading works best for endurance events that span more than 90 minutes. For the average Joe Bob who is a little slower than the faster athletes, this may mean an event that spans longer than 2-3hrs.

However, there are instances where carbo-loading raises the insulin levels in the blood which can cause problems for people that are diabetic. For diabetics, carbo-loading should be undertaken with a cautious approach and perhaps with some additional medical advice – especially insulin users as this can cause hyperglycaemia before, during, and/or after exercise if adequate insulin is not taken as part of the loading process.

Bergeron, Ph.D., FACSM\nNo doubt, many of you reading this feel that you’ve heard enough regarding the importance of drinking plenty of fluids and the benefits of staying well hydrated. After all, your players seem to drink a lot of water during play and most tend to avoid severe problems such as cramping or having to retire due to overheating.\nYet, many well-trained and “informed” tennis players continue to have hydration-related problems. From being a little “off” and not quite playing your best to painful heat cramps or heat exhaustion, there is a wide spectrum of symptoms related to inadequate or inappropriate hydration management that are commonly observed at many tennis tournaments, especially when it’s hot.\nThe three primary nutritional factors, related to keeping your players hydrated, are Water, Electrolytes, and Carbohydrates.\nThese are also the nutrients that have the most immediate effect on performance – positive or negative, depending if their intakes are managed well or not.\n• Many players begin play dehydrated.\n• On-court sweat losses can be extensive – 1-2.5 liters (~35-88 ounces) per hour is typical.\n• Any water deficit can have a negative effect on a player’s performance and well being. The effects of a progressive water deficit due to inadequate fluid intake and/or excessive sweat losses include\n• Increased cardiovascular strain – your heart has to work harder.\n• Decreased capacity for temperature regulation – you heat up more.\n• Decreased strength, endurance, and mental capacity – your intensity is lower, you tend to lose control, and you make inappropriate shot selections.\n• Increased rate of carbohydrate metabolism – you fatigue faster.\n• Many players to not adequately rehydrate after play.\nWhat you can do:\n• Drink plenty of fluids (water, juice, milk, sport drinks) throughout the day.\n• Don’t forget to drink regularly during all practice and warm-up sessions.\n• Have another 12-16 ounces about 1 hour before you play.\n• Drink at each changeover – typically, older adolescents and adults can comfortably drink up to 48 ounces or so per hour. This rate of fluid intake can prevent large fluid deficits from developing for most players.\n• After play, drink about 150% of any fluid deficit that still remains.", "score": 0.860952139, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:b455ac2c-9889-4b9e-98e0-c6dc59b01636>", "text": "Eating carbs for exercise\nOur bodies need fuel when we exercise. The fuel our bodies use is glycogen, energy made from carbohydrates that provides us with that energy. Glycogen also helps us to maintain our water levels.\nIn order to increase their performance, many endurance athletes will use a technique known as ‘carb loading’ before a big event. This means they carefully fill their body with carbohydrates so they have plenty of glycogen stored to fuel them on their race.\nNot enough glycogen can mean athletes literally run out of energy, so carb loading is key in aiding the performance of people set to run or perform for over 90 minutes.\nBefore you train, whether you are attending a martial arts class or going out for a one hour run, it is a good idea to eat carbohydrate-rich foods like porridge, wholegrain pasta and brown rice beforehand, as carbohydrates will help to fuel your exercise.\nBut how long should you wait after eating before running or training?

This holds particularly true when we discuss energy produced at a high intensity (during anaerobic exercise), such as that seen during a single bout of competition, or multiple bouts back to back.\nIn fact, carbohydrates are so important that it has been recommended that approximately 50% of an athletic individual’s daily energy intake comes from carbohydrates.\nAnd while it is apparent that carbohydrates are essential for energy production, and thus successful sport performance, it goes a little deeper than that. You see, not all carbohydrates are created equal, and the types of carbohydrates that we consume, and at what times, can significantly influence the rate at which we produce energy, and for how long we produce that energy.\nCarbohydrates are one of the three key macronutrients (protein, fat and obviously the topic of today’s discussion, carbohydrates) that we receive from food.\nDespite the fact that carbohydrates can be consumed in different forms (sugar, starches, and fibre), they are all broken down into glucose by the digestive system, which is then absorbed and shuttled around the body to be used for energy.\n(**It is important to note that fibre is the only exception to this rule, as it cannot actually be broken down within the digestive system, and passes through our digestive tract almost completely untouched.**)\nOnce absorbed, glucose is stored in the liver and muscle tissue. Once our energy stores are full, excess glucose can then be converted into fatty acid molecules, which are then also stored to be used for energy at a later time (which essentially describes the process of fat accumulation).", "score": 0.859796941, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:b232c6cc-58a0-48ca-ba5e-626878bebbf2>", "text": "For example, if your weight is down 1 pound at the end of play, you still need to drink another 24 ounces.\n• Players lose far more sodium and chloride (salt) from sweating than any other electrolyte.\n• Sodium and chloride losses are greater with higher sweating rates.\n• Sodium and chloride losses tend to be less with players who are used to (acclimatized to) the heat.\n• Sodium deficits can lead to incomplete rehydration and muscle cramps.\n• If you don’t replace the salt, you can’t completely rehydrate.\n• Excessive water consumption, combined with a large sweat-induced sodium deficit, can lead to severe hyponatremia (low blood sodium) – a very dangerous situation. Even mild hyponatremia can give a player a sense of fatigue, apathy, nausea, or a headache.\nWhat you can do:\n• When you play in a hot environment (or any time you sweat a lot), add some salt to your diet (or eat certain high-salt foods) before and after you play. Good sodium and chloride sources include\n• salt: ¼ teaspoon (or 1.5 grams) has 590 mg of sodium\n• salted pretzels\n• many types of soups\n• salted sport drinks (or Pedialyte)\n• tomato sauce (pizza!)\n• tomato juice\n• Adequate carbohydrate intake is crucial to optimal tennis performance.\n• Consuming carbohydrates before and after exercise can help restore some of your body water reserves.\n• Playing tennis in the heat causes the body to use carbohydrates faster. So, even if you eat well prior to playing, after 60 to 90 minutes of intense singles, chances are you’ll need some supplemental carbohydrate to continue playing your best.\n• Ingesting too much carbohydrate or too much of an inappropriate carbohydrate (e.g., fructose) can delay carbohydrate and fluid absorption and may cause gastrointestinal distress.\nWhat you can do:\n• Generally, 7-10 grams of carbohydrate per kilogram of body weight (~500-700 grams per day for a 155-lb player) is recommended for periods of intense training or competition.\n• During play, 30-60 grams per hour is most effective.

Although similar for long endurance training days, this blog will focus on pre-competition ingestion.\nMy last blog discussed the storage of carbohydrates in the body. Skeletal muscle has a capacity of 300-600g (1200-2400 kcal), while the liver has a capacity of 80-110g (320-440 kcal). Muscle glycogen fuels active muscles. Liver glycogen stabilises blood glucose levels that supply glucose to the brain.\nCarbohydrate intake in the hours before competition?\nFollowing overnight rest, liver glycogen is almost completely depleted. Muscle glycogen is also depleted but to a lesser extent. Since most endurance events lasting more than a few hours start early, breakfast becomes a very important meal. Consuming a high carbohydrate breakfast (140-330g carbohydrates) three to five hours prior to competition replenishes both liver and muscle glycogen. Consumption closer to an event will only replenish liver glycogen. Examples of carbohydrate rich foods include bread/bagel (with jam or honey), oatmeal, cereals and bananas.\nAlthough improved performance is often attributed to muscle glycogen, liver glycogen may be of greater importance. Liver glycogen helps to maintain blood glucose levels during exercise. With the onset of exercise, blood glucose levels will drop. Ingesting carbohydrates in the hours before exercise will help compensate for this by increasing the rate of carbohydrate and glycogen breakdown in addition to reducing fat burning (which can remain suppressed for up to 6 hours following carbohydrate ingestion). Despite these metabolic changes, there does not appear to be a negative impact on performance. This is likely due to increased carbohydrate availability compensating for the increased carbohydrate use.\nCarbohydrate intake in the last hour before competition?\nCarbohydrate intake in the last hour before exercise causes a spike in insulin levels and an increase in blood glucose. However, the onset of exercise will cause a sudden drop in blood glucose, known as rebound hypoglycemia. Simply put, your blood sugar becomes too low. This is not necessarily a bad thing but can affect individuals differently. A combination of metabolic processes that contribute to the drop include:\n- hyperinsulaemia (higher than normal insulin levels caused by sugar intake) which will trigger an increase in glucose uptake from the blood (result: decreases blood sugar).", "score": 0.857923269, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:c41e0f17-f51f-48af-9da3-67b715376b9e>", "text": "PROPER RACE NUTRITION & HYDRATION Before a big event there is often a traditional pasta party. We show why this is not good and suggest a better strategy for feeding before and during a competition..Purpose of race-feeding The first one is to get to the start line with the optimal storage of glycogen in your muscles and liver. The second is to prevent hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar level) during the effort. In two steps we need first to optimize our potential to store, and to then to release stored energy effectively. I. STORE (or loading) Super Compensation Over the past decades, Scandinavians have used a method, which consisted in a weeklong special regimen. It starts with an exhaustive training session one week before the race, while athletes consume a low-carbohydrate diet, yet continued exercising, to totally deplete muscle glycogen stores. Then, 3 days before competition, athletes rest and eat a high-carbohydrate diet to promote glycogen super compensation. This regimen has many drawbacks: the long training sessions necessary to reach a complete depletion of stores, while at the same time the athlete is already in a carbohydrate-low phase, can hardly be done with a pace close to that of the competition, therefore a sufficiently selective depletion of muscle fibers can not necessarily be obtained. considerable side effects such as nervous tiredness, hormonal disturbances, muscular breakage, can prejudice a successful race. This has led to the insight that the super compensation of glycogen reserves can be obtained by limiting the diet to the carbohydrate-rich phase and still gets an optimal performance. We know today, that endurance training is the primary stimulus for increased muscle glycogen synthesis. Endurance training increases the activity of the glycogen synthesis, and the enzyme responsible for glycogen storage. But timing is equally important! Today we know to have some very specific body adaptations, some metabolic windows. The Window It should be known that the starchy foods and leguminous plants (principal sources of carbohydrates in our food) can be stored in a greater proportion, in the form of muscular glycogen, after a significant depletion of stores. In the few hours (there is a 4 to 6 hours optimal window after the end of the effort) following a long and/or intense effort, which will have drawn largely from the muscular glycogen reserves, the conditions are thus favorable.", "score": 0.857295692, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:cd48161a-42e4-4270-bdd2-a6352552f464>", "text": "How much carbohydrate a day is healthy?\nIf you're a healthy weight for your height and consuming a 2000 calorie diet that's approximately 250g carbohydrate daily.\nFruits do contain carbohydrate, but only on average about a seventh of the amount in starchy foods which include pasta, rice, potatoes, bread and breakfast cereals.\nTo get your 250g daily you need to eat a portion of pasta, three slices of bread and a bowl of breakfast cereal - or a similar amount.\nOf course if you are losing weight you'll need to eat proportionally less carbs - for example someone eating 1200 calories needs 150g carbs.

To prevent the configuration bitstream from being intercepted during transmission and to provide design security, Altera's FPGAs use the advanced encryption standard (AES) and a 128-bit or 256-bit key for configuration bitstream encryption. The secure configuration flow is carried out in three steps:\nThe user-defined AES key is programmed into the volatile or non-volatile key storage.\nQuartus® II design software uses the same AES key to generate an encrypted configuration file, which is then stored in an external flash memory or configuration device.\nAt power-up, the flash memory or configuration device sends the encrypted configuration file to the Altera® FPGA, which then uses the stored AES key to decrypt the file and configure itself.\nAES is a Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) and has been approved to be used by United States government organizations to protect sensitive, unclassified information. It is also widely adopted both commercially and globally. The AES implementation provided by Altera has been validated as conforming to the FIPS-197 (PDF) standard.\nTo provide you with more choices, Stratix series and Arria series FPGAs offer both volatile and non-volatile encryption key storage.

With a self-contained system, everything related to audio processing is handled by the DSP hardware, including audio input, all signal processing and mixing, and audio output. Only the proprietary editor software runs native on the computer. The best known proprietary system is Pro Tools TDM. With a Pro Tools TDM system (there are Mix, HD, and HD|Accel versions available, each with different track counts and DSP power), the TDM hardware handles audio I/O using special TDM-only audio interfaces, mixes audio together with its 48-bit hardware mixer, and provides for effects processing using hardware-based TDM effects. The Pro Tools software serves as a native front end for the TDM hardware. Merging Technologies' Pyramix system is another self-contained audio production solution.\nNonproprietary hardware accelerators are not limited to working with a specific native-audio engine and allow you to integrate their DSP with plug-ins running natively in your chosen host software.

Open EDA development tools would be used, such that designers can provide feedback to open-source tools developers. The communication between FPGA-based board designers, open IP core designers, and open EDA developers will improve the whole development process of open source- hardware and lead to the next phase.\nPhase II (Advanced)\nThis advanced stage assumes that open-source hardware publicity has taken place. Designers will release advanced open-source designs, including FPGA prototyping boards. The market demand for prototyping boards will boom, which encourages vendors to produce volumes at low prices. The low price exists because the board designs are originally open source, and there is large market demand.\nThe vendors could produce open-source device programming tools in order to enlarge their market base. The objective of this stage is to allow an open-source hardware user to download open designs from Internet, and implement designs on prototyping boards, just as computer users download open-source software and run it on general-purpose processors in personal computers.\nPhase III (Run time configuration)\nAt this stage, the complexity and density of designs would reach the limitations of conventional programmable logic devices. The dynamic reconfigurability of certain programmable devices is characterized by their ability to reconfigure subsets of their logic and routing resources at runtime, while continuing to operate normally. This intrinsic dynamic reconfiguration results in accommodation of complex and dense designs while maintaining high performance.\nThe objective of this phase is open-source complex systems design and implementation. This assumes a seamless architecture of system models in which boundaries between software and hardware vanish. For instance, there is an effort to run a Linux kernel as a pure hardware platform that depends mainly on dynamic reconfigurability .\n6 High-tech promotion in developing countries\nOpen-source hardware can contribute to bridging the technological, educational and cultural gaps between developing and developed countries.

This FPGA-based accelerated deep learning platform is capable of delivering \"real-time AI,\" which will allow cloud infrastructure to process and transmit data as fast as it comes in, with ultralow latency. In the cloud, delivering real-time AI is becoming more important as systems are required to process live data streams, including video, sensors or search queries, and rapidly deliver the data back to users.\nThe Project Brainwave system is built with three main layers:\n- A high-performance, distributed system architecture;\n- A hardware DNN engine synthesized onto FPGAs; and\n- A compiler and runtime for low-friction deployment of trained models.\nFirst, Project Brainwave leverages the massive FPGA infrastructure that Microsoft has been deploying over the past few years. By attaching high-performance FPGAs directly to Microsoft's datacenter network, the company can serve DNNs as hardware microservices, where a DNN can be mapped to a pool of remote FPGAs and called by a server with no software in the loop. This system architecture both reduces latency, since the CPU does not need to process incoming requests, and allows very high throughput, with the FPGA processing requests as fast as the network can stream them.\nSecond, Project Brainwave uses a powerful \"soft\" DNN processing unit (or DPU), synthesized onto commercially available FPGAs. A number of companies are building hardened DPUs. Although some of these chips have high peak performance, they must choose their operators and data types at design time, which limits their flexibility. Project Brainwave takes a different approach, providing a design that scales across a range of data types, with the desired data type being a synthesis-time decision. The design combines both the ASIC digital signal processing blocks on the FPGAs and the synthesizable logic to provide a greater and more optimized number of functional units. This approach exploits the FPGA's flexibility in two ways. First, Microsoft has defined highly customized, narrow-precision data types that increase performance without real losses in model accuracy. Second, the company can incorporate research innovations into the hardware platform quickly (typically a few weeks), which is essential in this fast-moving space.", "score": 0.20899356451564804, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:ba9eae76-429f-44e7-b498-858d09db694e>", "text": "FPGAs for DSP Hardware\n- the advantages and disadvantages of using FPGAs rather than DSP processors in the DSP hardware.\nWhen designing the hardware system for a DSP application it is necessary to carefully consider the approach that will be taken. One of the fundamental decisions involves whether to use a standard DSP processor, or whether to use an FPGA in the DSP hardware. Each has its own advantages and they need to be carefully balanced at the earliest stages of the design.\nA DSP processor is a specialised processor that is designed specifically for operating complex mathematically orientated intensive calculations very swiftly. As processing needs to be undertaken almost in real time, the speed of the processor is one of the main limiting performance criteria for the performance of the system For example very steep filters need more processing than those that are not so steep, etc..\nWhile DSP processors, despite their sophistication in terms of processing have limitations, they also have advantages. One of these is in their cost. They may still be expensive by some standards, but they are nevertheless cheaper than their counterparts, the FPGA.\nFPGAs for DSP\nThe other approach that many adopt is to use an FPGA as the core of the DSP hardware. These devices can be programmed and there are many set cores that can be used to provide the routines that are required. For example if a filter is required, then it is possible to tailor circuitry within the FPGA to undertake this. Similarly other functions can be programmed in on top of the basic processor. In this way the FPGA is able to be programmed to provide a highly efficient and tailored solution.\nThe main disadvantage of the FPGA is its cost. FPGAs are more costly that DSP processors and therefore performance has to be weighed against cost.\nFPGAs and DSP processors provide two very different approaches to the design of DSP hardware systems. Each have their own advantages. There are many high sampling rate applications that an FPGA does easily, while the DSP could not. Equally, there are many complex software problems that the FPGA cannot address.\nRead more radio receiver tutorials . . . . .\n|• Superhet radio||• Sensitivity||• Software radio||• Cognitive radio|\n|• FM demod||• AM demod||• DSP tutorial||• Selectivity & filters|", "score": 0.12854466862627348, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:b7dabe9b-2143-41e9-b07e-3b4117ffcce1>", "text": "Developers of embedded and high-performance systems are taking increased advantage of FPGAs for hardware-accelerated computing. FPGA computing platforms effectively bridge the gap between software programmable systems based on traditional microprocessors and systems based on custom hardware functions. Advances in design tools have made it easier to create hardware-accelerated applications directly from C language representations, but it is important to understand how to use these tools to the best advantage, and how decisions made during the design and programming of mixed hardware/software systems will impact overall performance.\nThis paper presents a brief overview of modern FPGA-based platforms and related software-to-hardware tools, then moves quickly into a set of examples showing how computationally-intensive algorithms can be written, analyzed and optimized for increased performance.\nIn recent years, FPGA-based programmable platforms have emerged as viable alternatives for many types of high-performance computing applications. The opportunities presented by these platforms include the rapid creation of custom hardware, simplified field updates and the reduction or elimination of custom chips from many categories of electronic products. As FPGAs have grown in logic capacity, their ability to host high-performance software algorithms and complete applications has grown correspondingly.\nFPGA-based platforms range from individual FPGAs, with or without embedded soft/hard processor cores, to higher-performance FPGA-based computing platforms. The recent explosion in the use of FPGA embedded processors has proven that FPGAs can provide a flexible, powerful hardware platform for complete \"systems-on-programmable-chips\". FPGA vendors now provide, at little or no cost, all the processor and peripheral components needed to assemble a highly capable, single-chip computing platform. In addition to processors and common processor peripherals, such a platform can include one or more customized, highly parallel software/hardware accelerators.\nThe increased use of these FPGA-embedded soft or hard processors is particularly noteworthy. These processors can be useful for a variety of reasons: they can run legacy code, including code that is planned for later acceleration in the FPGA fabric; they can be used during development as software test generators. They can also be used to replace custom hardware structures for such things as embedded state machines, and for standardized I/O. And they can host complete operating systems and perform non-critical computations that would be too space-intensive when implemented in hardware. When arranged as a grid, multiple soft processors can even form a parallel computing platform in and of themselves – one that is more generally programmable than an equivalent platform constructed entirely of low-level FPGA gates.", "score": 0.10497974845514332, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:a2414b48-cfbe-456e-b9bb-0e62a515f9a3>", "text": "It consists of an FPGA with integrated up to 16GB High Bandwidth Memory (HBM), PCIe (Gen 3, 16 lanes) and two Ethernet QSFP28 interfaces, able to deliver 100Gbps each.

The outer layer called FPGA Hardware Macros includes the hardware macros that are available on the FPGA. Those are fixed IP blocks that have been implemented by the FPGA vendor and include functionalities such as PCIe, HBM, external DDR memory controllers and Ethernet connectivity.\nThe next inner layer contains MEEP specific controllers. Those controllers not only manage the hardware macros of the outer layer but also provide interfaces towards the Accelerator, the innermost layer. Those interfaces include memory controllers that can access the on-chip HBM and external DDR memory, Ethernet functionality, and FPGA-to-FPGA communication. By bringing the HBM memory close to the computational resources, another bottleneck that is commonly found in HPC applications, is removed: The data transfer rate from and to the main memory. Usually, the memory is located off-chip and hence despite the available computation capabilities, they cannot be fully utilized as the data cannot be moved in and out of the processor fast enough.

Cantle’s team were pioneers in FPGA-based supercomputing more than a decade ago, and both their hardware and software have continued to be among the most effective at putting FPGAs to work in challenging computing problems. Cantle pointed out that, thanks to current language and tool technologies like OpenCL and HLS, we are now arriving at a state where teams can access the benefits of FPGA-based acceleration without having resident hardware experts.\nOne problem that needed to be addressed, however, was form factor. Software-centric teams are not accustomed to buying chips. In fact, most software-centric teams are uncomfortable even with the idea of boards. While hardware engineers live every day in the land of silicon and FR4, software engineers like their computers to come in nice sturdy boxes – preferably with a built-in power supply. Nallatech is currently attacking that problem as well – building FPGA-based accelerator cards as well as full rack-mounted systems (with partners like HP and IBM) that take advantage of Altera’s FPGAs and OpenCL flow.\nThese types of platforms have FPGAs knocking on the door of the data center – a land of riches previously off limits to our LUT-laden lads.

I take this opportunity to wish you an happy new year 2015, fulfilled with great new designs and hopefully as few bugs as possible. Like previous years, I will take some time to review – from my perspective – the last year in the excitating world of electronics innovation (device + software) related to power electronics applications.\n2014: The SoC year\nFor me 2014 has been the “SoC” year with main FPGA manufacturers (i.e. Altera & Xilinx) heavily promoting their new ARM processor centric + FPGA fabric devices (the Cyclone V SoC for Altera and the Zynq for Xilinx). While the idea of having a hard processor connected to a FPGA is not new (Microsemi is doing this since a while with SmartFusion released by Actel in 2009 and Xilinx have had hard PowerPC processors in their Virtex II since 2002), the idea of positionning those devices as “software-centric” is new. What it means is: with those SoC devices (Cyclone V & Zynq), you are not buying a FPGA anymore: you are buying a software programmable chip that has a bunch of peripherals around two ARM processors plus some FPGA fabric. That’s a radical change of mentality from hardware companies that must be applauded. The typical embedded software guy can now program a “FPGA SoC” device without having to deeply know about FPGA first: they can start programming their application software of the ARM processor and then optimize I/Os & some hardware accelerated functions with FPGAs. This is without mentionning that those device now integrate in the large ARM software ecosystem and all synergies that it provides.\nHow this impacts power electronics apps ? From an system architecture point of view, a power converter (for motor control and solar power conversion) is only another type of peripheral inside a system (just like an audio or a video peripheral). Electronic product devices typically have three interfaces: (1) a human machine-interface (buttons), (2) a communication interface (for external world data exchange / IoT) and (3) a specialized interface (in the case of a surveillance system, that’s a camera in the case of an electric motor drive that’s a power stage).", "score": 0.03996409634647845, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:9fab26c8-b7c5-4d3d-a609-d30e3131ebb1>", "text": "The FPGA and VHDL courses covers the design and implementation of digital circuits using FPGA devices and the VHDL hardware description language.\nThese courses are typically targeted at professionals in the field of electronic engineering, and are designed to provide them with the skills and knowledge they need to design and implement complex digital systems using FPGAs and VHDL.\nIn an FPGA course, participants will learn about the architecture and features of FPGA devices and how to implement digital circuits using them.

Consequently agricultural production in these areas is generally limited to grassland-based ruminant systems that are currently heavily reliant upon Government support payments to be economically viable . However, it has been reported that N. pseudonarcissus grown at altitude may yield higher concentrations of galantamine compared to bulbs grown under lowland conditions . Thus growing Narcissus spp. for galanthamine production in marginal areas could impose sufficient stress to increase galanthamine synthesis and so offer a novel solution to the issue of constrained galantamine supplies. This approach would simultaneously increase the economic resilience and social sustainability of less favored rural areas. Legislative constraints surrounding plowing of long-term grassland (the land cover accounting for by far the greatest proportion of upland farms ) limit options for traditional cropping however. Furthermore, to date it has been the bulbs of Narcissus plants that have been used as material for extraction of galanthamine , again requiring soil disturbance.\nOur proof-of-principle study tested the feasibility of an innovative dual-cropping approach to producing plant-derived galanthamine based on integrating N. pseudonarcissus growing into existing marginal pasture and harvesting green above-ground vegetative plant materials rather than bulbs. By cultivating the crop in marginal growing conditions, we seek to exploit the previously observed increase in endogenous galanthamine biosynthesis of N. pseudonarcissus grown under such conditions  but also to enhance biosynthesis further through the imposition of interspecies competition with forage grassland plants.

Sainfoin also is extremely palatable and nutritious for all classes of livestock and wildlife. Livestock actually prefer sainfoin even when other plants species are readily available. Other uses include wildlife habitat restoration, wildlife food plots or as a legume component in the conservation reserve program (CRP). Sainfoin is often compared to alfalfa based on its nitrogen fixation, forage capabilities, and nutritional value. The main advantages of sainfoin are the earlier maturation rate, non-bloating qualities, resistance to the alfalfa weevil and higher digestible nutrients when compared to alfalfa. Another important advantage over alfalfa is that sainfoin is resistant to the root rot phase.

It is native to Siberia, Mongolia and China. In North America it has been used in pasture and hay production in western Canada from Saskatchewan to British Columbia. It is adapted to sites receiving 12 to 24 inches annual precipitation, but persists longer with higher precipitation. It is said to have high saline tolerance and is adapted to all soil textures. It was grown in test plots in Saskatchewan with electrical conductivity levels up to 6.7 dS/m. It is not as winter hardy as crested or intermediate wheatgrass in semi-arid climates with little snow cover. It is very competitive during establishment but loses competitive ability as the stand ages. It establishes quickly and has high seedling vigor, making it a good candidate for reclamation or quick pasture.\nDahurian wildrye is a tall plant with leaves growing high up on the stem providing excellent forage for pasture. It also has better regrowth after harvest than intermediate and crested wheatgrass and can be grazed 2 to 3 times per season. It produces significantly greater amounts of forage than crested and intermediate wheatgrass in the first growing season but decreases as stands lose vigor in subsequent years. Forage quality and palatability of Dahurian wildrye is high, comparable to intermediate and crested wheatgrass. It is a short-lived perennial with quick establishment and is used as an early forage component with other slower growing species. Because it regrows quickly after harvesting it has a better yield distribution than other forage grasses.\nDahurian wildrye has exceptional grazing recovery. It can be grazed in early spring without negative effects. However Dahurian wildrye has a shallow root system and plants can be pulled easily from the ground in wet spring soils during the establishment year. New seedings should be protected from grazing until they are well established.", "score": 0.831980526, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:a512ff92-05ad-4fc5-a8a4-29eb4dcaceda>", "text": "Technical annex to DEFRA project NF0612 Final Report, DEFRA, London.\nFraser MD , Vale JE , Firbank LG (2014) Effect on habitat diversity of organic conversion within the less favoured areas of England and Wales.

Diablo Country Club is located in San Francisco’s “East Bay” area, at the foot of the historic Mt. Diablo.\nThe routing of the Diablo Country Club golf course is a testament to the legendary gentlemen who designed this uniquely historic course. In 1915, 23-year-old two-time California Amateur Champion Jack Neville designed his first golf course, creating the original nine holes at Diablo. Building on this success, Neville’s second design was none other than the original Pebble Beach Golf Links. In 1920, designer William Watson, one of California’s most successful and prolific golf course architects in this Golden Age of golf course design, created the second nine at Diablo, crafting most of Neville’s original holes into this new 18-hole course. Watson’s next assignments were designing The Olympic Club and Harding Park, both in nearby San Francisco. By the end of the 2020 season, 12 major championships will have been played on courses originally designed by these two golf legends. Diablo Country Club is quite unique in this regard, as it is the only golf course in the world to showcase the designs of both Neville and Watson.\nDiablo’s renovation project has seen a comprehensive update of every feature. This includes fully renovated new greens and green surrounds, both resurfaced to the latest improved bentgrass, which will provide the ultimate playing surface. In many instances, greens were restored to their original size, restoring lost hole locations. All other turf was converted to drought-tolerant bermudagrass, and overall maintained turf acreage has been reduced by more than 35 acres. The majority of these reclaimed natural areas are being restored to drought-tolerant fescue and native grasses, or the California Oak understory is being returned to its natural state. All bunkers have been recreated, with many restored to their original locations. All tees have been built to a more natural shape and contour, as originally designed. The backbone to all of these improvements, however, is a new irrigation system.", "score": 0.850190699, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:64324d79-2147-45db-81da-26b5bf704ae6>", "text": "An excerpt from a 1912 essay on golf architecture explains Colt’s approach, ‘A couple of long holes at the commencement get the players away from the first tee…After that the sequence of the holes does not matter and what we have to look for are four or five good short holes, several good length two-shot holes, varying from an extra-long brassies for the second to as firm half-iron shot, one or two three-shot holes, two or three difficult drive and pitch holes, A fairly equal distribution between what I have designated as good-length two-shot holes and the others of all degrees seems to me to be about right. What we want to have is variety, gained by utilizing all the best natural features of the land, and alternating the holes of various lengths.’ Colt and Crump’s scheme at Pine Valley follows this outline to a T.\nSeaview, designed by Hugh Wilson, officially opens January 1915. That same month, Crump, getting much needed R & R, sets the course record (75) at Pine Forest in Summerville, SC.\nIn March 1915 Tillinghast reports the original plans have been altered with Crump’s discovery of a great natural hole-the very strong par-4 13th. It had been found while clearing trees near the 12th green. This necessitates a change in the 14th and a slight change to the position of the 15th tee. The exact date of this discovery is not know, but it seems likely it occurred the previous year. In his January article, Simon Carr described the 13th as a longish par-4 (cleek approach) and the 14th as a drive and pitch. In Colt’s plan the 13th was a drive and pitch and the 14th a par-3. The change of the 14th from a par-3 to a par-4 alters the balance Colt had originally devised-leaving only three short holes (Crump would eventually convert the 14th back to a par-3). It is reported the final holes will be completed as rapidly as possible.\nThe nations foremost turf expert-Frederick W.

Though Toronto golf is noted for its handful of world top-100 candidates, I have long argued that the depth of quality golf around Toronto is what makes Toronto such a great golf city. Though most of these courses are private, golfers that have the opportunity to play Toronto's lesser-knowns, courses like The Summit, Thornhill, Weston and Oshawa, will be surprised and impressed.\nAt Oshawa, Thompson has embraced the rolling terrain to create a quirky and strategic golf course with a generally tight routing. Diagonal ridges are used to tremendous effect at the 2nd and 10th making those standout holes not only on this golf course, but in the entire province. Greensites have been cleverly selected, many of which are nestled into the side of hills or atop small plateaus. I am not sure the evolution of the golf course since its early years, though it is clear that trees now impede lines of play. In some cases I suspect tees have been added in search of additional length but at the expense of a cohesive routing -- Thompson was never uncomfortable asking the golfer to walk a distance from green to tee, but in several places short walks are bypassed in favor of more dramatic (and longer) tee positions.\nThe first is an excellent opener. At about 350 yards and with the fairway narrowing around the 150 yard marker, many will choose to take less than driver from the tee. Line is more important than distance here. Play to the right and the approach will be very awkward, blind over a ridge to a green angled to receive shots from the left.\nThe second is a great hole, and like the opener at Owen Sound CC, shows Thompson's mastery in integrating diagonal ridges to affect strategy. Play to the right, away from the stream and where the carry over the ridge is shortest, and the angle of approach is considerably more difficult.

Coore and Crenshaw spent a number of weeks on the property, getting a feel for the land to discover what holes were in the land. It’s a process Coore goes through and is minimalist design at its finest. By selecting sites with interesting terrain that lend themselves to golf design with minimal movement of land, the course is more placed on the land than it is built. It’s a process where both men spend a lot of time on the property. As a result, their policy is to only take on two projects a year, to allow themselves sufficient time on site, evaluating the routing, deciding whether the land is more inclined to go in other directions and leaving no detail overlooked. The other project they worked on the year of Hidden Creek? Friar’s Head. The result of this process at Hidden Creek is a course that highlights how sublime minimalist design can be. Subtle in appearance yet complex in play, Hidden Creek is an infinitely enjoyable inland course that incorporates strategy, course knowledge and terrain movement as some of its identifying features.\nRestricting it to a minimalist design, however, is actually a disservice to C&C since their efforts and craftsmanship go well beyond figuring out how the land lends itself to golf. The course is also molded along the lines of those heathland courses mainly found in England. I touch on heathland courses a little in my Wyncote review, but a good way to think of them are as inland links courses. They also incorporate features of parkland courses, and can typically include trees in many spots. They’re typically in lowland areas with sandy soil, heather and gorse. The more well known heathland courses include Sunningdale Old and Walton Heath. As a true heathland, there are some features that are indeed manufactured. Several of the mounds and bunkers are dolled up, which is exactly the type of features these courses had, as a way to inject playability and (ironically) naturalism.

It was to be the last of the first five holes designed and built so that it could be adjusted as necessary. The possibility existed that 200,000 cubic yards of material would have to be used from other development areas due to timing issues or lack of readiness in other areas. This first rough design took into account this volume of material and used the similar tall stockpiles that initially existed on this hole as the key feature or design element. It also allowed us to hide the tremendous rock face near the second landing area until the golfer walked through two large features, something we valued from an experience perspective.\nDuring the next year or so many changes to the community center and golf course clubhouse location and concepts were introduced to the overall site plan.\nWe were constantly adjusting the location and elevation of the green to better relate to the new or adjusted concepts. The overriding concern was always that we wanted to enjoy and experience the 18th hole in some manner from the clubhouse.\nWith about six months until construction started on the 18th hole and just before the holiday season, we were asked by one of the clubhouse architects to raise the green almost 20 feet or more if possible. Some of that was simple as we had located the green in a natural depression which would have created a nice downhill approach shot had we been able to keep that idea.\nWe took a few weeks looking for ways to raise the green, shift it slightly and still create a great finishing hole. We really don't like perched greens for any reason. While it took some time, the idea of creating a bench between the 1st and 2nd shot was explored. We still had to gain elevation from the start of the bench to the green but at least the green would not be isolated and instead built into a gradual rise. We still did not know how much material we had available but this approach used about half of the original 200,000 yards which seemed like a good place to be.\nThe plan shown to the left was not our first grading plan but at this point we could not wait any longer.

Now, he is throwing his hat in the golf-course design ring by opening The Grove XXIII in Hobe Sound, Florida. Bobby Weed is Jordan’s architect, and Weed promises to provide a progressive, 18-hole layout that works for on-course betting and match play. Weed states the course will give golfers a dynamic layout with breezes coming from every direction on every hole.\nThis Tiger Woods-inspired course set to open in Ridgedale, Missouri promises to provide the Midwest a championship-level golfing experience. Woods says the course will offer short walks between tee boxes and holes making it a “walking-friendly course.” Set to open in late 2019, this is the first course inspired by Woods that is open to the public.

It marks the first Fred Couples Signature Golf Course in the region. Golfers play alongside, across, and even through the natural and diverse arroyos. The experience is ever-changing and no two holes look or play alike. Eckenrode further explains:\nPredominately, our routing focused on two aspects: maximizing the incredible ocean views through orientation, and best-utilizing the interest and strategic challenge of the native arroyos in as many varied ways as possible.\nWhat really separates the golf course from others in the region, however, is how the course plays. The ball bounds about, and there is an ability to run the ball into nearly every hole,especially if the slopes are utilized. Due to this, the golfer will try shots they may not try elsewhere. Coupled to the variety of shots they are presented with, the golfer is constantly engaged in a creative sense.\nSet atop high terraces overlooking one of the most beautiful stretches of the Los Cabos coastline, the 7,156-yard golf course is interwoven among the dramatic, rugged arroyos, beautiful native vegetation and dramatic rock formations of the native terrain. Absolutely stunning ocean views are showcased on nearly every hole, as backdrop to a classic and traditional styling of architecture. Rumpled fairways, natural-styled bunkering and short-cut fairway heights throughout, significantly add to the appeal of this new, world-class par-72 layout.\nTodd Eckenrode points out that Fred Couples played an integral role in the design of the course, adding great value to the project.

Bacterial canker is a common and sometimes lethal disease of trees in the genus Prunus including cherry, plum and peach. Bacterial canker is sometimes also referred to as “gummosis”, “blossom blast”, “dieback”, “spur blight” and “twig blight”.\nWhat does bacterial canker look like? Often branch dieback is the first symptom of bacterial canker that homeowners notice. However, other more subtle symptoms of flowers, leaves, fruits and branches typically precede this dieback. Initially, infected trees are symptomless. Infected flowers often open, but then collapse. Infected leaves become spotted and yellowed. The centers of leaf spots often shothole (i.e., fall out). If spotting is severe, leaves may fall off. Infected fruits develop dead spots surrounded by water-soaked tissue. Spots can eventually develop into a fruit rot. Branch or trunk infections often occur at pruning sites and lead to cankers (i.e., sunken, dead areas). Cankers often produce a gummy, resinous ooze, and wood in the cankered area is typically discolored. Flower, fruit and branch infections can become systemic, leading to twig dieback, death of larger branches or even death of an entire tree.\nWhere does bacterial canker come from? Bacterial canker is caused by the bacteria Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae (Pss) and P. syringae pv. mors-prunorum (Psm). These bacteria overwinter in cankers, in asymptomatic, systemically infected branches, and in buds of susceptible trees. Pss is also known to occur naturally on the leaves of many plants including many weed species. Both Pss and Psm can subsequently be spread by rain splash, wind or insects. The bacteria can also be spread to healthy branches when contaminated pruning tools are used. Infections most often occur during cool, wet conditions.\nHow do I save a plant with bacterial canker? Prune infected branches at least 12 inches below cankers or other dead tissue, and dispose of branches by burning or burying them.", "score": 0.859111, "source": "dense"}]}

He provided transformational leadership and seized the window of opportunity to convince municipal politicians of the need for a new management regime for the lower Helgeå River catchment (Olsson et al. 2004b).\nAlthough there was a change in the management regime for the lower Helgeå River catchment in 1989, various environmental projects had been initiated before that. These projects ranged from biological inventories and monitoring programs to habitat restoration projects and improved land-use practices. For example, in the Kristianstad Project, various management practices for reducing nitrogen and phosphorus loads to the Helgeå River were tested. These practices included restoring water courses, establishing dams, protecting riparian zones, and creating artificially flooded meadows. It was a collaborative project involving land owners, the University of Lund, the Municipality of Kristianstad, the Kristianstad County Agricultural Board, Önnestads Agricultural and Horticultural College, and a local branch of the Federation of Swedish Farmers (LRF). Although these projects involved a diversity of actors at multiple organizational levels, their focus was often narrow (Olsson et al. 2004b). Also, the various projects were often unaware of each other.\nSome local actors realized that the problems of declining bird populations, abandonment of management practices for cultivating flooded meadows, and decreased water quality and overgrowth of lakes were interrelated and connected. However, the social structures and processes for dealing with the problems were not. SEM saw the need to deal with this lack of fit, and initiated strategies to match the scale of the problems and manage the area at the landscape level. At the time, SEM was employed by the County Museum, engaged in developing outdoor museums, and he focused on the flooded meadows in the area. He began to link key individuals of different projects (Fig. 1). He used the area’s “water” as the common denominator for linking these projects and managed to change the perception among key actors from seeing the wetlands as a problem (“water sick”) to seeing it as a valuable resource (“water rich”).", "score": 0.829571784, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:ea1a2380-5557-48ed-9bfd-23e464575336>", "text": "On behalf of the Swedish Agency for Marine and Water Management, AquaBiota has developed a Swedish framework for conservation value assessment of the marine environment.

This results in changes in the flow of water, higher in autumn and winter and a longer period with lower between April-September.\nWith its 460 kilometres, central location, and powerfulness the river Klarälven is of great significance for many stakeholders in Värmland county.

Measures taken to minimize the rivers impact on surrounding environment and infrastructure must also contemplate other aspects such as biodiversity, hydropower production and cultural heritage, making this a complex and important issue.

Compact cities denote planning goals and measures in order to promote more densely populated cities seen as a necessary condition for sustainability. Containment strategies imply that the future expansion of urban population, activities and interactions would be kept within the existing borders of the built-up areas to hamper the urban sprawl. The theory behind this assumes close and direct links between the physical form of the city (the land use) and people's activities in time and space (Naess 1993, Newman & Kenworthy 1991). These ideas have influenced many planning documents on different levels in the European countries.\n6In Sweden, at last, this planning ambition is further emphasized by a general belief, that the Swedish built-up areas continue to spread out and that the entire urban system gradually develops into a North-American situation, where extensive urban areas, sparsely populated, generate immense transportation needs, absolute car-dependency and high levels of energy consumption. The spread is thus perceived as a major driving force behind an ever-increasing mobility.\n7Empirically this boils down to questions concerning people’s need for travel in different spatial structures. However, do people living in large and densely populated cities travel less, covering shorter distance, in their everyday lives than people living in smaller and more sparsely populated built-up areas? Perhaps the situation is more complex. A general access to cars and high-speed infrastructures combined with fairly homogeneous patterns of time-use among people may yield similar amounts of travel, despite different regional characteristics (Vilhelmson 1999).\n8Against this background two sets of related questions will be explored regarding the actual development in Sweden of the urban or semi-urban structures, and their influence on people’s everyday mobility. The first set of questions deals with land-use and spatial growth: Do the built-up areas in Sweden expand? And are the population densities continuously thinning out in such areas? Our data concern the period 1970 - 1995.\n9The second set of questions aims to investigate the main mobility trends of the population: Do people living in dense (or compact) urban areas travel less than people in small and more sparsely populated built-up areas?

This fact in combination with heavy industries metallurgy (including mining) and paper mills makes the energy issue a top priority.\nThe Swedish government has appointed Dalarna together with Skåne and Norrbotten to be pilot counties for green development.\nThe County Administrative Board Dalarna, comprising 15 municipalities, has worked since 2003 to direct the different sectors of society towards new common energy goals. This work is organized within a cooperation called “Energy Intelligent Dalarna”, where all stakeholders from the energy sector are represented. One of the results of this work is the establishment of energy action plans for the region as a whole and for all the municipalities specificly. Another result is the elaboration of a “Energy and climate strategy” that tells us that the county of Dalarna can become a net exporter of renewable energy in 2050.

Pre-existing scenario planning methods call for collaboration between community members, but when cultural norms prevented men, women, and youth from coming together in the community of Ukupseni in Panama, the authors and community sought to devise an alternative method. The research objectives were twofold. First, to develop an alternative scenario planning method that would facilitate learning among decision makers about community needs and perspectives, and second, to explore ways to direct desired futures. Instead of forecasting through community-wide collaboration and backcasting with the creation of one vision through consensus, forecasting used individual interviews to create scenarios and backcasting was conducted separately with each of the six community groups (older women, young women with children, young women without children, young men, older men including fishermen and lobster-catchers, and individuals with formal education) resulting in several visions. To unify the results, we created an organizational matrix that allowed the visions of different community groups to be compared. The organizational matrix allowed decision makers to observe that women and youth, the most marginalized members of the community, had convergent visions that were very different from men whose perspectives and knowledge are more often included in decision making.\nbackcasting; collaboration; forecasting; Kuna Yala; scenario planning", "score": 0.817023754, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:f484df53-40a2-4a1b-94b3-02437e129702>", "text": "We focus especially on the bridging function in SES and the factors that constrain bridging in multilevel governance systems, and strategies used to overcome these.

In June 2005, the area became a Man and Biosphere (MAB) Reserve. The lowland area has long been appreciated for its cultural and natural values. Aside from having high biodiversity and unique habitats of cultural–historical values, it is one of Sweden’s most productive agricultural areas and also contains one of the largest groundwater reserves in northern Europe. The abundance of valuable ecosystem services generated in the area is also reflected in the range of stakeholders representing different interests, from local farmers to international nature conservation organizations (Olsson et al. 2004b, Schultz et al. unpublished).\nThe Emergence of a New Management Approach\nSince 1989, a flexible collaborative approach to the management of the lower Helgeå River catchment has been in use, which promotes a management that treats humans as part of ecosystems and includes social, economic, and ecological dimensions. This shift in management regime had its beginning in the early 1980s. Several individuals, representing different local organizations, observed a continuing decline in natural and cultural values. This was despite the fact that the area was listed in 1975 by the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance. In particular, they observed declining bird populations, decreased water quality, and overgrowth of lakes, and a decrease in the use of flooded meadows for haymaking and grazing.\nIn response to an anticipated crisis, personal links developed among these individuals, and a social network of concerned individuals and organizations started to emerge.", "score": 0.816773534, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:8877b035-0ac2-4e77-ad7a-b5f8fb760f64>", "text": "How to integrate Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and navigate goal conflicts at the local level\nThis policy brief is based on the first of Nordregio’s three Localising Agenda 2030 webinars in 2022.

This means that educational plans, Vislets, were produced based on indicators from the World dataBank. The Vislets were published on the teachers’ educational blogs on the Internet (Figure 6).

Schoeman\n📝Land Use Management and Transportation Planning Book Synopsis : The interface between land use management and transportation planning represents probably the most important spatial impact in sustainable land use, mobility and transportation development. Prior to this book, only limited attempts have been made to integrate these topics as to enhance smart growth and sustainable development principles within spatial systems. The approach followed differs internationally and specifically between different planning and transportation authorities. The spatial impacts of land use and transportation serve as the main catalyst in urban form, development and its associated problems. These impacts represent severe consequences from a built and environmental development perspective. All of these are covered in the book and its supporting chapters. The focus of the book is the application of best practice principles in managing the interface between land use management and transportation planning. Internationally the practice is the promotion of more sustainable urban and rural forms supported by improved levels of accessibility through the application of smart growth and sustainability principles. The focus however remains to successfully optimise land use and transportation integration. The structuring used within each of the chapters provide the reader with the basic and applicable theory and practical knowledge to attain system wide integration and sustainability within the dynamics of spatial and transportation systems.

It is determined that the regional (territorial) development strategy is a definite set of regulative measures which first of all are to coordinate the joint actions to specify some potential positive prospects of the spatiotemporal changes in the major parameters.The development strategy is a target document. It is formed in the process of strategic development, the idea of which is the statement of the research goals, a choice of the main priorities (directions) of a region development, determination of the ways to advance, the selection of necessary technologies and institutes, the establishment of a necessary sector structure of the economy and the methods of solving social problems.\nThe economic discussion of sustainable development show that it is possible to define the concept sufficiently precise to introduce it in economic models and to get some policy results.

Short-term goals are to:\n- develop scenarios using the latest science that considers the social, environmental and economic elements of sustainability;\n- influence policy-making and motivate citizens to support policies to achieve a sustainable future for the region;\n- and promote networking of existing planning efforts taking place at different scales in the region.\nLong-range planning for sustainability poses the challenge of indeterminacy - ignorance, surprise, and human volition (Raskin et al., 1998).

The Province’s Growth Plan and the Greenbelt are our best opportunity to shape this growth in a sustainable way, with walkable communities that have vibrant main streets, higher-order transit, and food grown close to home.\nBut how do we get there? A critical component of planning is trying to predict the future: how many people are coming to the region, where they will live and work, and what type of housing they will need. If the numbers are wrong, or if any of the predictions don’t fall into place, even the best laid plans won’t work.\nOntario’s planning regime has fallen victim to poor methods, questionable numbers and faulty predictions. Indeed, a recent report by former Director of Community Planning for the Region of Waterloo Kevin Eby paints a picture of unmet forecasts and excessive urban sprawl.\nEby found that many municipalities use out-dated forecasting methods, almost 20 years old, that aren’t up to the job. The existing prediction methodology looks back at what was done before and then projects exactly the same into the future.

Candidate starts about 30 feet from the training tower with a 100 foot hose bundle on their shoulder. At the start signal they go into the tower and climb to the fourth floor where they deposit the hose bundle at the top of the steps. They proceed to the opposite corner of the building and raise a 40# weight up to the window sill level then lower it back down, automatic DQ for letting the rope slip through the hands on the way back down. They then pick the hose bundle back up and go down the steps, automatic DQ for skipping steps on the way down. They then exit the tower and cross back over the start line where they deposit the hose bundle on the ground. Then they go back to the tower and take a ladder off of hooks on the wall and set it on the ground. Next they take another ladder and raise it up against the side of the building. From there they go to a third ladder and raise the fly section to full extension then lower it back down, again no letting the rope slip. They then lower the second ladder back down to the ground and replace the first ladder back onto the hooks. (Now comes the hard part.) Once done with the ladders they hop onto a Kaiser Force Machine and use an 8# sledge hammer to drive the weight the full length of the machine. If they have any energy left they then go to a fire hydrant prop and turn the hydrant wrench 12 turns clockwise, DQ for going over a fault line. After the hydrant they drag a metal sled 100 feet.

The American Lung Association reports that tobacco use is significantly more prevalent in rural communities than urban communities, with almost a third of residents in rural counties smoking (27.8% compared to 22.7% in urban areas). Moreover, smokeless tobacco use is higher in rural areas, rural users tend to start at an earlier age, and exposure to secondhand smoke is greater in rural households and workplaces. Despite higher rates of tobacco use and associated health problems (e.g., chronic lung disease, cancer, heart disease, stroke), residents of rural areas are less like to have access to evidence-based smoking cessation programs.\nSmoking cessation efforts in rural communities require a multipronged approach. At the local level, city- and county-wide policies to establish tobacco-free settings promote new cultural norms regarding smoking and protect non-smokers from exposure to secondhand smoke. Marketing campaigns further increase residents’ knowledge of the harms of tobacco products and work to combat the long history of targeted advertisements in rural areas sponsored by tobacco companies. Finally, increasing the availability of smoking cessation programs through a variety of free Quit Your Way modalities (in-person, online, or telephone counseling plus nicotine replace products) aims to overcome the historically inadequate accessibility of such programs.\nAll healthcare providers should check in with patients about their smoking habits and provide an overview of the array of resources available to those who are open to quitting. Professionals at every level of the healthcare system have the ability to quickly assess patients’ smoking status, provide factual information on the harms of tobacco use, and help inspire patients to quit by employing a strategy called Motivational Interviewing.\nMotivational Interviewing is a proven counseling style that helps ambivalent patients move toward quitting tobacco. Many healthcare professionals are accustomed to educating patients on what steps they need to take to improve their health, but research has shown that merely telling patients to quit smoking does not often result in behavior change. Motivational Interviewing, in contrast, aims to highlight discrepancies between the patient’s goals and their current behavior. Providers are encouraged to ask patients about their personal reasons for quitting, their understanding of the risks of tobacco use, the expected rewards of quitting, and any potential roadblocks to quitting.", "score": 0.87273705, "source": "dense"}]}

We gauge productivity by measuring\nthe amount of algae suspended in lake water. Algae are small plants\nthat provide food and oxygen for fish and other aquatic life.\nWhile some algae are essential for a healthy lake, too much can\nhave a negative impact on recreational uses and aquatic life.\nThe LMVP also measures the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus in\nthe lake. These two nutrients act as fertilizers, promoting algal\ngrowth. In some of our lakes, inorganic solids such as soil particles\ngive the water a brownish color. The LMVP measures the amount\nof inorganic suspended solids in lakes where it might influence\nwater clarity. All volunteers also take Secchi\ntransparency readings. This is done with a Secchi disk, an\neight-inch diameter black and white disk that is lowered into\nthe lake until it disappears, thus providing a measure of water\nclarity.

Operating since 1997, community members volunteering through ALAP collect water samples and other data on 90 lakes in the Adirondacks. The results help uncover the impacts of road salt, understand recovery from acidification, and address other challenges to Adirondack lakes. The recent grant funding expands opportunities for additional community members to contribute toward this effort.\nDespite the wide reach and success of ALAP, many of the Adirondacks’ 3,000+ lakes and ponds have not been surveyed for water quality in more than two decades, and some have never been assessed. The lack of long-term data and regular assessments present many challenges to the protection of these important resources. On the New York side of the Lake Champlain Basin, just 32 lakes are monitored regularly.\n“We’ve done an excellent job of monitoring Adirondack lakes at a regional scale but often lack the data necessary to make informed decisions about individual waterbodies,” says Dr. Brendan Wiltse, senior research scientist at AWI. “Adirondack lakes are facing stress from climate change, road salt, harmful algal blooms, failing septic systems, and invasive species.

Nutsedges are among the most noxious weeds of agriculture in temperate to tropical zones worldwide. They are difficult to control, often form dense colonies, and can greatly reduce crop yields. In California, nutsedges are particularly problematic in summer-irrigated annual and perennial crops. Purple nutsedge is not as widespread in California as yellow nutsedge, Cyperus esculentus, and grows in the Central Valley, South Coast, and low desert to an altitude of about 820 feet (250 m). It also resembles another sedge, green kyllinga, Kyllinga brevifolia. Purple nutsedge tubers are bitter and are used medicinally in India and China.\nSeedlings are rare. When found, seedling leaves are similar to that of the mature plants, but smaller. The stem base is slightly triangular and the midvein area is usually pale. The first two to three leaves emerge together, folded lengthwise.\nPurple nutsedge propagates by tubers formed on underground, horizontal creeping stems called rhizomes, mostly in the upper foot of soil. Sprouts from tubers are similar in appearance to the mature plant.\nThe purple nutsedge stem is erect, glossy, and hairless. Although its leaves superficially resemble grass leaves, they lack collars, ligules, and auricles. The leaves of purple nutsedge are thicker and stiffer than most grasses, are V-shaped in cross-section, and arranged in sets of three from the base rather than sets of two as in grass leaves. Purple nutsedge flowering stems are triangular in cross-section; grass stems are hollow and round. Purple nutsedge can be distinguished from yellow nutsedge because it has shorter stems and grows only up to 1-1/3 feet (0.4 m) tall, whereas yellow nutsedge stems can grow to 3 feet (0.9 m) tall. Purple nutsedge leaves are dark green, 1/8 to 4/17 of an inch (3–6 mm) wide, and have rounded tips; yellow nutsedge has light green leaves, a pointed tip, and a leaf width of 1/6 to 2/5 of an inch (4–9 mm).", "score": 0.862637579, "source": "dense"}]}

The first thing your body does is to limit the blood loss by decreasing the amount of blood flowing to the area of the wound. The proteins in the blood together with blood platelets and plasma work together to form a protective layer which is called a scab. The scab protects the wound from outside infections while your skin is being regenerated underneath the scab.\nAs a new skin is being generated the wound gradually starts to heal. The wound starts healing from the outside and works its way towards the centre until the lesion has been totally covered. The scab will fall off once the wound has been totally covered in a new skin layer.\nIf only the outer epidermis layer has been cut, the chances of a scar appearing are less to nothing. If the cut penetrated deeper into the dermis of your skin, then the cicatrisation (closing of the would through scar formation) begins as your body starts to create fibrous scar tissue from the granular tissue. In short, the deeper the cut the more likely it is that a scar will develop.\nThe time period for your body to bridge a deep cut is anywhere between three to six weeks. The body does this by producing a protein called collagen at the area of the wound to repair it. It can take up to two years for the scar to settle into its permanent appearance. It should be noted that the appearance of scars of 2 years old or older can also be very effectively treated with silcone gel to reduce the appearance of the scar.\nScar tissue is very different from normal skin tissue in that it does not have sweat glands and it does not have hair growing from it. Scar tissue is also more sensitive to ultraviolet rays. The appearance of most scars are white and the scar lies flat against the surface of your skin. There are other scars called Hypertrophic or Keloid scars that take on an odd appearance. Hypertrophic scars are raised at the wound area and they are reddish in colour and could be itchy. These types of scars are very effectively treated wil silicone gel strips. Keloid scars appearance are also red in colour and are also raised but well over the area of the wound, onto healthy skin tissue.", "score": 0.844010472, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:14ee381b-b5a9-4f35-a2f6-f25eaadde11b>", "text": "I am wondering, why do big, deep wounds leave scars and small ones do not?\nMost wounds leave some kind of scar. It's just that we sometimes can't really tell because it's so small.\nHere's how wound healing generally works:\n- Blood clots and forms a scab (this may not happen, for example in burns and puncture wounds that didn't draw blood\n- White blood cells (macrophages) \"clean\" the wound - the wound may appear to be oozing some fluid. Blood flow increases, the macrophages produce growth factors.\n- Blood flow increases more, red blood cells deliver more oxygen. Cells at the edge of the wound secrete collagen. The wound fills with tissue called granulation tissue.\n- New skin grows over that tissue.\nThese stages are called hemostasis, inflammation, proliferation, and remodeling. This process can take weeks to years depending on size and location of the wound.\nNow, what's a scar? Scars look different from \"normal\" skin because of collagen. Collagen is a protein on the outside of the skin cells holding them together and making skin strong (it's also a major part of tendons). In normal skin the collagen sort of forms a \"criss-cross\" pattern, while in scar tissue it's more parallel. That probably comes from the wound healing process.\nIn small wounds, you won't notice that the skin looks different because of that.

This process consists of two parts - regeneration and repair. During the regeneration component, specialized tissue is replaced by the proliferation of surrounding undamaged specialized cells. In the repair component, lost tissue is replaced b granulation tissue which matures into scar tissue.\nPhases of healing\nThe different healing phases is not mutually exclusive and tend to overlap quite a lot.\nShort phase immediately after injury, lasting about 6-8 hours, and up to 24 hours after a crush injury. The time of the bleeding will depend on the extend of the soft tissue injury and the management thereof. The more vascular the injured structures, the more bleeding will occur.\nThe goal of the inflammation phase is to stop the bleeding phase. This is achieved by vasoconstriction, retraction of injured blood vessels, fibrin deposition and clotting. The blood supply to the area increases in this time, causing oedema and redness. This phase starts rapidly within a 6-8 hours after the soft tissue injury, reaches the maximal reaction between 1-3 days and gradually resolves in a few weeks. Phagocytosis also happens during this phase.\nThe acute inflammatory involves activities that generate exudates - plasma-like fluid that exudes out of tissue or its capillaries and is composed of protein and granular leukocytes (white blood cells). Chronic inflammatory response is of prolonged duration and involves the presence of nongranular leukocytes and the production of scar tissue.\nThe acute phase involves three mechanisms that act to stop blood loss from the wound:\n- Local vasoconstriction occurs, lasting a few seconds to as long as 10 min. Larger vessels constrict due to neurotransmitters and capillaries and smaller arterioles and venules constrict due to the influence of serotonin and catecholamines released from platelets. The resulting reduction in the volume of blood flow in the region promotes increased blood viscosity or resistance to the flow, which further reduces blood loss at the injury site.", "score": 0.8372069, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:9056828d-96c1-4352-a06e-f2679b68f0a6>", "text": "How do you know when a wound is infected?\nThis can be very difficult.\nA continuum exists between when pathogens colonize the wound and then start to cause damage.\nThere is no absolutely foolproof laboratory test that will aid in this diagnosis.\nBack to first slide\nView graphic version", "score": 0.836255908, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:7741101a-f848-4901-acec-1408e2fc9a88>", "text": "How do you get blood vessels to feed the tissues that you're putting into the body?\nWhen we got started in this area, our team began to look at the body's natural healing response and tried to replicate that outside the body. So by looking at the growth-factor biology of cell-to-cell interactions, we were able to come up with a strategy that had to do with finding the cells in the body that actually do the regeneration. Not just to take a piece of tissue, but truly to target these cells. Of course, now we call them committed-progenitor cells, but back then we didn't know what they were. But, in fact, they're the stem cells of the organ.\nNow we can harvest those cells and grow them in large quantities, so much so that we can take a centimeter-square piece of tissue, and by day sixty you'll have enough cells to cover a football field. But how do we then put these cells into the body? The largest group of cells that you can put into a body without blood vessels is three millimeters cubed. That's about the size of a pencil eraser. So you can see that if we're going to try to repair a heart that's damaged, it's going to be a lot larger than that.\nNature solves that problem by branching. From the lowest forms of life, like algae, to an individual organ system to trees in the field and their leaves, branching is the solution. Therefore, we designed scaffolds that have a pattern that allows the cells to grow in branches. Using these techniques, we've been able to engineer several tissues and several organs. We've learned how to make cartilage, heart and other muscle, and endothelial cells, which might lead to blood vessels learning how to make bone.\nAnd we can do this with many different kinds of tissues. We've had urethras in patients for five years. We've been able to engineer an entire bladder. We've been able to engineer other organs as well that we haven't yet published on.\nOne of the challenges, however, is what you do with a patient for whom you don't have tissue available.

Their job is to ward off invading bacteria, clean up cells that have been damaged beyond repair, and create a wall between the injured area and the rest of the body. These responses involve the release of various enzymes to \"dissolve\" dead tissue, and bursts of peroxide-like substances to kill organisms.\nAs you might imagine, this is the most uncomfortable phase for the horse, but it is absolutely essential to set up the proper conditions for healing. As the inflammation begins to subside, chemical messengers that trigger the growth of new blood vessels and the proliferation of connective tissue cells and skin cells take over.\nThe best way to minimize the severity of the inflammatory phase, and keep it as short as possible, is to clean the wound thoroughly, remove all dead tissue, and keep it clean. Infection prolongs the inflammatory phase and prevents healing. Uninfected wounds, with no dead tissue, resolve the inflammatory phase within three days. Heavy use of anti-inflammatory drugs during this period is counterproductive. It's better to ease any excessive discomfort by applying ice for recommended periods. Otherwise, leave the body alone to do its work. The wound is at its weakest during the inflammatory phase and can easily break open or become more extensive with excess movement or any trauma.\nAlso called the \"proliferative\" stage, this is when the production of new blood vessels, skin cells and deeper connective tissues occurs. Blood vessels will supply the needed nutrients. Connective and scar tissue will be laid down in the depths of the wound and gradually rise to skin surface. Skin edges all around the wound will start growing toward the center until they meet. As this phase progresses, the strength of the wound increases.\nOnce the area of the original wound has become covered with scar and skin tissue regrowth, it will be able to resist breaking open. However, scar repair may not have as much elasticity and freedom of movement as normal tissues. Over the following weeks, months or even years, as the horse moves about he will be continually putting minor stresses on the scar tissue that cause it to go through cycles of microscopic breakdown and repeated repair.

This allows your body to carry more oxygen to your organs and tissues, supporting the healing process.\n\"Oxygen, in and of itself, is a drug,\" explains Dr. D'Angelo. \"When it meets certain parts of the body, it can have a healing effect.\"\nNormally, oxygen gets delivered to wounds through your blood system. During hyperbaric therapy, your entire body receives the treatment. As a result, oxygen can actually go beyond the reach of your arteries — extending the healing benefits of oxygen.\nWhen you add in the air pressure of the chamber, it concentrates the delivery of oxygen to specific areas, such as a wound that needs healing.

Chronic wounds are one of the most debilitating symptoms of Recessive Dystrophic EB.\nThe research project, funded by DEBRA Ireland and DEBRA UK, particularly focuses in on the role of macrophages in the wound healing process.\nIn normal circumstances, macrophages are vital for wounds to heal effectively. This is because macrophages are white blood cells which signal to the body that wound healing needs to take place. The macrophages remove dead cells from the wound and promote inflammation to take place, which is the body’s natural healing process.\nMacrophages also support the development of new cells and tissues so the wound can heal effectively. They then assist to resolve inflammation, so it does not become problematic. Taking all of this into account, it is clear to see just how important it is that macrophages are functioning properly in the human body. So why do they not function this way in EB?\nThat is exactly what Prof Eming hopes to discover through observing the behaviour of cells from the wounds of patients with Recessive Dystrophic EB in the laboratory. With the knowledge the researchers gain, they hope to develop new methods to restore the function of macrophages in those who have EB.

These surgical procedures require taking part of the patient’s own skin (or donor, synthetic, or animal skin) and placing it over the burn wound.

Specifically, the essential amino acids (those amino acids not produced by the body) have been shown to stimulate collagen production and speed wound repair.\nHow do essential amino acids help jump-start collagen production in wounds?\nBecause collagen is composed of less than 10% essential amino acids, there are most likely enough available to stimulate collagen protein building (that’s why collagen synthesis in normal skin isn’t responsive to increased intake of dietary amino acids).\nSo, it’s not an availability issue. Rather, essential amino acids help regulate the inflammatory process—and not just during stage 2 of wound healing, but throughout all phases.\nEssential amino acids decrease the number of inflammatory cells that are activated during the entire process of wound healing. By decreasing these pro-inflammatory cells, the body can make more fibroblasts—the cells that produce collagen during the proliferative stage of wound healing.

Therapy was continued for one more day to avoid complications and the patient was sent home the following day.\n“Dogs and cats can have underlying diseases like allergies or autoimmune diseases that can lead to secondary skin infections,” Dr. Heinrich says. “Because the skin is compromised by the underlying disease, these lesions can take a long time to heal, sometimes months.”\nWound healing involves three stages. First, the body lays down a clot, which acts as scaffolding on which the new tissue can build. The second phase is repair and proliferation, during which the wound contracts and granulation tissue forms. During the third stage, the granulation tissue is remodeled, and a scar forms.\n“Problems can occur in any one of the three phases and delay wound healing,” Heinrich says.", "score": 0.032423999848350184, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:06dceac1-2589-4e81-a050-07558f6e75a6>", "text": "It also does not have any known side effects or risks that other laser treatments do have.\nRepair Wounds and Damaged Tissue\nAnother of red light therapy benefits is the ability to speed up the healing of wounds. The wavelengths that red light therapy emits promotes wound healing, tissue repair, and skin rejuvenation. This is different from other laser treatments that are used for skin rejuvenation. Other laser treatments used by dermatologists to rejuvenate skin do so by first damaging the skin. This therapy skips the damage and directly stimulates the regenerative process.\nRed light therapy benefits damaged tissue and healing of wounds. NASA even uses red light in space for this purpose. Healing occurs through regeneration of fibroblasts in immune cells that are contained in skin tissue.\nThe production of ATP, a source of energy in body tissues also known as adenosine triphosphate, is stimulated by red light therapy. ATP helps to increase blood circulation which reduces inflammation. ATP also encourages white blood cells to repair any damaged tissue which supports the speed of the healing of wounds.\nReverse Hair Loss\nThe studies about how red light treatments reverse hair loss are slightly mixed, but a moderate number of both men and women have been very successful with using the therapy to fix this common problem. Many studies have been done, like a 24 week study of both men and women, that showed improved hair density and thickness. These patients used a helmet that emitted red light for their treatments.\nRed light therapy benefits blood flow in the scalp and stimulates the hair follicles during the growth cycle. This causes hair to grow faster and thicker than before. Red light therapy can treat balding due to aging, androgenetic alopecia, and genetics.\nHelp Improve Your Mood\nRed light therapy benefits the mind as well having multiple mental and emotional perks. It can increase self-confidence, positivity, social awareness, and improve conversational skills. Its main use is for seasonal depression due to variations of daylight. But even just seeing the color red can improve your mood. Countless studies have been done on this phenomenon.\nRed light therapy can be used in a similar manner to acupuncture, which has been known to improve patient’s moods. The wavelengths can stimulate certain areas as the small acupuncture needles would. This can result in a happier mood and could even help treat more serious mood disorders, such as depression.", "score": 0.029937141035893327, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:a43609cb-94f4-443b-96fd-f1000fafe041>", "text": "Tissue regeneration is a revolutionary medical approach based on the idea that living tissue can be used to stimulate the natural healing process of the body. On its own, the body can repair and regenerate itself, as seen in the natural healing of wounds, burns and broken bones. Other vertebrates also have this ability, notably certain reptiles that can even regrow amputated limbs. In tissue regeneration, the natural ability of the body to repair and heal is encouraged, mainly by introducing engineered living cells into a diseased or damaged part of the body.\nThis form of medical healing is also called regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. It is an approach that applies the principles of medicine, biology and engineering. Tissue regeneration is used chiefly to accelerate the healing process, and to promote the healing of diseased tissues and organs that will not heal or mend on their own. Regenerative medicine is especially helpful in healing broken bones, chronic wounds and deep burns, but it also has been shown to help repair damaged nerves and structures of the heart.\nTissue regeneration consists of three main components, which include living cells, the matrix that supports them, and cell communicators. The matrix is the medium within which the living cells thrive, and the cell communicators are the communication or signalling mechanism that stimulates the cells. All three work together to promote regeneration of the living cells and their immediate environment. This results in the growth of new tissues to replace the old, damaged ones.\nThe living cells used in tissue regeneration are usually the same type of cells found in the diseased tissue or injured organs. The cells can come from the person himself, in which case they are called autologous cells. They can also come from another person, which are called allogeneic cells. It is generally better to use autologous living cells because they are not rejected by the patient’s body. Allogeneic cells don’t always work because the patient’s immune system rejects the foreign cells.\nThe living cells are artificially multiplied in cell banks, many millions of times over. When they are ready, they are pieced together to form a medicinal construct that is then integrated into the diseased tissues in the patient’s body. Then the construct is left alone to stimulate the natural healing process and hopefully restore the patient to good health. Continuing research and experimentation in tissue regeneration is underway. Doctors and scientists are confident that they will discover even more medical applications for tissue engineering.", "score": 0.023447476675563208, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:5a30f6b5-2834-4638-9ce7-7659cba6630e>", "text": "Vitamin C, or ascorbic acid, is a water-soluble vitamin—meaning that our bodies do not store it so we need to obtain it from food or supplements.

Several control methods such as V/F control method, Vector control and VVC+ have been used to achieve the desired speed of AC motors such that it meets industrial process requirements. AC motors have been extensively used for pumps, fans and air compressor applications. According to the International Energy Agency, electric motors consume 46% of the electricity generated in the world. They account for nearly 70% of the total industrial electricity consumption in industries. As per European Commission’s report the pumping system accounts for nearly 22% of the energy supplied. VFDs have a tremendous potential to save energy, especially in pump applications.\nVFD: Saving Energy through Motor Speed Regulation\nIn many water pumps and flow applications, a mechanical throttling device such as a mechanical valve or electro mechanical valve is used extensively to control flow of water where a fixed AC supply is used to run the motor. Although this method is an effective means of control, it leads to wastage of energy. Figure 1 below represents a pumping system connected to mechanical throttling valve which has a manual or automatic control. In this case, the AC motor is run with fixed AC supply and therefore it runs the motor at full speed and flow control via throttling device leading to energy wastage. To overcome the energy loss, VFD based water flow control is shown below in Figure 2 where AC motor is powered via VFD to control the speed of the motor which gives an opportunity to save energy depending on the speed at which the motor is operated.\nFig: 1 Constant Speed Pumps controlled Via Throttling Devices\nFig: 2 Variable Speed Pumps controlled Via VFD\nA VFD operating at 70% speed can result in 65.7% cost saving\nSignificant energy savings and hence cost savings opportunities are available if we use VFDs for pump applications.

In a recently installed application, Energy Drive identified two water feed pumps which provide water to the storage dam suppling a wash plant. The pumps are belt driven by two 132 kW motors at 415 V.\nDue to the varying plant water requirements, the pumps are sized to deliver adequate water to meet the highest demand. As a result, the storage dam overflows during periods where less water is required; therefore, the site expends energy for no process gain.\nThe site team recognised this energy saving opportunity, and elected to partner with Energy Drive to deliver a solution. Energy Drive’s unique zero-capex “energy as a service” approach allowed the client to focus on production with the confidence that the project would be delivered effectively. Going forward Energy Drive will monitor and fully maintain the installation providing guaranteed uptime and response.\nDuring the assessment phase Energy Drive collaborated with the site engineering team to analyse the operation of the water feed pumps. A proposal that detailed a capex-free energy saving solution was developed and approved\nby both parties.\nIn June of 2021, Energy Drive installed a tailored variable speed drive solution on the existing water feed pumps. This allowed the site to make use of an ultrasonic level detector to control the storage dam level to a setpoint that suited them. This solution allowed the site to run the pumps at much lower frequencies, only providing the water necessary to keep the dam level at the stipulated setpoint.\nThe system has been operating under Energy Drive control since 01 June 2021 and is forecast to produce 1 598 166 kWh in savings over the contract period. The Energy Drive team will continue to maintain contact with engineers and operators on site to further understand and optimise the system on an ongoing basis.

It’s a device that pumps mud for solids control equipment. Figure 1 shows a generic, single stage centrifugal pump and Figure 2 illustrates a multistage centrifugal pump.\nThese pumps can utilize either open or closed impellers and may have single or multiple stage designs. Centrifugal pumps utilize Bernoulli’s principle to develop pressure (see Bernoulli’s Principle Explained below) by first increasing the fluid velocity inside an impeller and then decreasing the fluid velocity in the discharge nozzle. These pumps consist of a shaft with bearings for support and an impeller as well as a pump casing. To prevent leakage from the pump casing to the atmosphere, most pumps employ packing, single or dual mechanical shaft seals.\nCentrifugal pump performance is typically presented graphically with a series of curves similar to the group shown in Figure 3. The manufacturer usually provides curves that describe how flow, differential head, net positive head required, and efficiency change with pump flow.\nUseful centrifugal pump facts:A. The suction or inlet nozzle to the pump is always bigger than the discharge nozzle.\nB. If a centrifugal pump has more than one impeller inside of it is called a multistage pump. If it has, for example five impellers in it, then it is a five stage pump\nSeries and Parallel Operation\nCentrifugal pumps may be operated in a series or parallel (see Figure 1.4) configuration. When operating pumps in series, the pressure is increased across each pump, but the flow through each pump is identical (minus any minor flow losses due to leakage). When operating in parallel, the pressure rise on each pump is identical, but the total flow is increased. However, the overall flow is not doubled with two pumps operating in parallel because of “system head” or pressure.\nThe easiest way to understand system head is to remember that the discharge pipe size stays the same diameter and therefore tends to restrict the higher flow generated by two pumps operating in parallel. This bottleneck effect means that two pumps operating in parallel will always deliver less than twice the flow that one pump can deliver.\nThere are three physical forms of a fluid energy: Elevation energy, pressure energy, and velocity energy. The higher a liquid is stored, like water in a water tower, the greater its potential energy. The greater a fluid stream’s pressure, the greater it’s potential to do work.", "score": 1.3444967593549712e-06, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:369374e1-0a4e-4297-b778-df502964a17a>", "text": "Overland Park, Kan. – SPX Cooling Technologies Inc. has released details of its expanded MH Fluid Cooler line, designed to meet an even more diverse range of applications. The MH Fluid Cooler is now available with three coil materials, each delivering its own advantages.\nThe most recent innovation, the MH Element™ Fluid Cooler, is equipped with copper coils. Copper offers superior corrosion resistance and improved heat transfer. Compared with traditional hot-dip galvanized (HDG) coil fluid coolers, the copper coil requires 35 percent less fluid volume, and cooler operating weight is reduced by 20 percent. Copper is also sustainable, with a high recycle value at the end of its operational life.\nOther MH Fluid Coolers are available with coils of either HDG steel or stainless steel. HDG steel offers good thermal performance in a closed and pressurized system. Models with stainless steel coils require more surface area and are often utilized in coastal regions and applications prone to corrosion.\nOne of the most efficient closed-circuit cooling towers in its class, the MH Fluid Cooler is a hybrid system that combines the functionality of a cooling tower and a heat exchanger. Utilizing a combination of evaporative fill media and prime surface coils, the MH Fluid Cooler offers significantly improved performance over conventional non-hybrid systems. Compared to forced-draft products with comparable footprint, its proprietary CoolBoost™ technology uses up to 75 percent less fan energy, requires up to 35% less process fluid, and reduces operating weight by 15 percent or more.\nHVAC applications include water source heat pumps, water-cooled VRF (variable refrigerant flow), geothermal heat pumps, and chillers. Industrial process cooling uses include water-cooled air compressors, injection molding machines, induction furnaces, and other machine or jacket cooling.\nThermal capacities of all standard MH Fluid Coolers are independently certified by the Cooling Technology Institute (CTI) for performance with water, ethylene glycol solutions, and propylene glycol solutions. The MH Fluid Cooler is backed by SPX Cooling Technologies’ five-year mechanical warranty and energy efficiencies that exceed ASHRAE Standard 90.1 requirements.\nFor more information, visit https://dev-spx-cooling.pantheonsite.io/library/marley-mh-fluid-cooler/.", "score": 3.852899105801375e-07, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:8797e5c4-09a6-40e0-be87-67cd9987b20e>", "text": "Waterco - Hydrostorm 1HP Pump (with Marine Grade Seal)\nCouldn't load pickup availability\nHydrostorm Pool Pumps\nWaterco Hydrostorm Pool Pumps are from Waterco's High-Performance range of pool pumps.

As a result, gains in energy efficiency also generate improvements in water efficiency – and vice versa – helping reduce a building’s lifecycle costs and boost its performance.\nControlled success Automated building management systems (BMS) common in larger structures also multiply the positive impacts of a systems approach to improving energy and water efficiency in commercial buildings.\nThese complex BMS systems enable facilities managers to operate buildings to maintain a comfortable environment, while closely monitoring the performance of the individual mechanical, electrical, plumbing and other components that must work together to achieve that goal.

This is more suited for an intermediate surfer, because the bottom can also have rocks and the waves are point break, and mainly from the right – this is the perfect option for you if you are looking for a challenge. However, because it is so close to a big city, sometimes pollution can be an issue.\nThe two main surf schools and shops are Aloha – that has a webcam feature in their website that allows you to see the seashore in real time! – and Hart Beach, powered by Quicksilver. Both provide surfcamps as well, and serve some delicious food at their huts!\nBergen aan Zee\nOur last location is the northernmost of all three.

Divers can plunge down further into the sea to explore the number of well-preserved ship wrecks that are found at varying depths of the ocean.\nFor those who prefer not to get wet but don’t want to miss the experience of this great underwater encounter, then a glass-bottom boat ride to view the gorgeous reefs is a good option.

The beach and village are stretched along the coast; don't expect a cozy bay or small-beach feel, although the brown sand is clean. Hikkaduwa couldn't really be considered \"charming,\" but it is accommodating. You'll have plenty of room on the spacious beach and decent choices for restaurants.\nWith medium-sized waves and fewer underwater hazards to avoid, Hikkaduwa is a popular place for beginners to take surfing lessons from one of the many schools on the beach. The small turtle hatchery is a good place to learn about the plight of sea turtles and see adorable baby turtles try out their fins for the first time.\nGet There: Reach Hikkaduwa by flagging any bus heading southbound along A2 to Galle or Matara.

Golfers who attack the ball steeply will tend to benefit from higher bounce as it will prevent too much digging. Those with a shallow swing may prefer a ‘sliding’, lower bounce Wedge as it will prevent the club from popping up of the surface and help them get under the ball.\n- Wedges designed with bunker play in mind will normally feature more bounce. With sand being softer the turf, the additional bounce helps lift the club and consequently the ball out of the trap. Unless the sand is very hard, very low bounce Wedges can be a little trick to use out of bunkers.\nThe general Bounce angle is not the only feature that affects how a Wedge interacts with the ground. The shape or ‘grind’ of the sole will help determine the kind of impact with the ground on full shots and will also dramatically influence how well you can play ‘finesse’ and creative shots like chips and Flop Shots. As options will vary between manufacturers, it is important to come in and let us show you these, but for some further guidelines click the button on the right.\n- Certain Sole shapes will help you lay the club face open, essentially adding loft to the club which can help you to play high flying, soft landing shots.

They strain tiny singled celled plants and bacteria out of the water for food. There is actually plenty of food in the water for them, its just so small you and I cant see it without a microscope. We call the tiny animals that mussels eat for food plankton, and we call the way mussels eat filter-feeding. Another intertidal animal, whelk (a kind of snail), eats mussels. It drills a tiny hole in the mussel shell with tiny sharp teeth. After it makes the hole it can eat the mussels insides by slurping it up like a straw. There a wide number of ways that intertidal animals eat, and plenty of things in the water for food. As for temperature, the intertidal animals here around UCSB live in water that ranges from about 50-66 F. They are very tolerant of a wide range of temperatures, especially since they can get very hot and cold at low tide, when they are out of the water. If the water gets too hot or cold, the animals and plants in the intertidal can die or stop growing and breeding. You might notice that in El Nino years, the large kelp stands off the coast die off. This is from the very warm waters that occur during El Ninos. I study how intertidal animals respond to heat. When they get too hot, some of the important chemicals in their body start to break down. The animals then start to make repair chemicals, called heat shock proteins to fix the damage. This helps them to withstand hot conditions.

Each side of the shell is a valve; hence gastropods, such as snails, are sometimes called univalves. Some common bivalve species include clams, oysters, and mussels. There are both freshwater and marine bivalve species.\nThough bivalves are superficially similar to another group of aquatic animals, brachiopods, they have distinct anatomical differences. In a brachiopod, the two halves of the shell indicate the top and bottom of the animal's body, while in a bivalve, the two sides of the shell are the left and right halves. In addition, bivalves have much more morphological sophistication and diversity than brachiopods. For example, many have evolved to be mobile, whereas all brachiopods are sessile, or attached to the substrate.\nThe bivalve first appears in the fossil record around 520 million years ago, near the end of a period known as the Cambrian Explosion. Brachiopods appear earlier in the Cambrian period and are much more numerous than bivalve mollusks throughout the Paleozoic era. However, after 96% of brachiopod genera went extinct during the end-Permian extinction event marking the close of the Paleozoic era, bivalves began to dominate the scene. Bivalve species survived the extinction event better than most groups, with only 59% of bivalve genera dying out.\nThe impressive survival rate of bivalves during the end-Permian extinction event, as well as their later proliferation and current success, are probably related to their many sophisticated adaptations to marine life. Instead of using muscles to open and close their shells, as brachiopods do, bivalves use a muscle to close their shell, but open naturally when the muscle is relaxed due to the help of a ligament. This adaptation allows the bivalve to conserve energy. Bivalves lack a radula, the toothed tongue-like structure that other mollusks use to eat, and instead are filter-feeders.\nMany bivalve species are mobile, though they move in a variety of ways. Some propel themselves by opening and closing, sucking in and expelling water.", "score": 0.026311482960730152, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:d3137f3d-26db-41a2-b87e-83903ce27821>", "text": "Thursday, September 23, 2010\nThere is an interesting blog over on discovermagazine.com about the way sea walnuts (or ctenophores, or Mnemiopsis leidyi) feed (in addition to a cool video, which is posted below). Apparently, these organisms use their cilia to create almost undetectable currents, and they are then capable of catching unsuspecting prey with great efficiency. Due to their incredible ability to feed stealthily and efficiently, they have been particularly devastating invaders in European water bodies. When these comb jellies showed up in the Black Sea, they contributed to a food web collapse by consuming many of the fish larvae that would typically serve as the base of the food chain. In fact, gelatinous zooplankton are often considered productivity dead-ends; they consume productivity in the forms of other plankton, however, they offer little food value to other species. So the productivity is not transferred to other trophic levels, and food webs collapse. This is also becoming a problem in human impacted systems.\nThis blog made me remember some research some colleagues at the School of Marine and Atmospheric Science conducted. PhD student Marianne McNamara, under the tutelage of Darcy Lonsdale, investigated the impact of high abundances of ctenophores on larval bivalve mortality.\nIn their article \"Shifting abundance of the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi and the implications for larval bivalve mortality,\" published earlier this year in Marine Biology, McNamara et al investigated how ctenophore abundance has changed, their digestion rates, and finally, their ability to control bivalve larvae. The data from this article is of particular importance for the hard clam restoration and management effort in Great South Bay, NY (their field sites), since the comb jellies may exert a strong predation pressure on hard clam larvae.\nThey conducted field surveys to investigate the abundance of ctenophores and other zooplankton. They enumerated and took volumetric measurements of the comb jellies, then looked at their gut contents. Finally, they conducted lab feeding experiments, and then used equations to calculate their ability to control bivalve larvae.\nMcNamara et al found high densities of ctenophores in the early summer, and larger ctenophores in the late summer, and when compared to the literature, densities were considerably higher than in previous decades.", "score": 0.0002228468440120353, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:51e69120-2f7c-4a2b-bc88-01e9ad8317cd>", "text": "All mollusks have three germ layers and display bilateral symmetry in their body structure. A key feature of the group is a large muscular foot that helps them to move about on land or on the ocean floor.\nAn important characteristic of mollusks is the presence of a coelom, a central cavity in the body that contains the digestive tract and vital organs such as the heart and liver. The cavity is lined with mesodermal tissue. The presence of a coelom enables those seemingly simple animals to have well-developed digestive, excretory, respiratory, circulatory, and nervous systems. In evolutionary terms, the presence of a coelom is considered an advanced feature; as such it is characteristic of other “higher” invertebrate groups, such as annelids, echinoderms, arthropods, and chordates, as well as vertebrates.\nThe largest group of mollusks are the gastropods; gastropods include the many forms of terrestrial and aquatic snails, which have shells, and the slugs, which do not. Aquatic gastropods have gills, whereas land snails have a lunglike structure. That structure lies within the mantle, a fleshy layer that lines the shell (in shell-bearing species) and forms a mantle cavity between itself and the animal’s body. Gastropods feed using a rasp-covered tongue, called a radula, that is used to scrape algae and plant matter off rocks and other surfaces.\nBivalve mollusks make up the second largest molluscan group, which includes oysters, scallops, mussels, and clams. Bivalves have a pair of hinged shells that can be closed for protection but opened for feeding. Most bivalves are marine organisms, though there are some freshwater species. Bivalves generally do not move about much, if at all, during their adult lives. They obtain food by filtering water through their gills and extracting suspended particles. Their eggs are released in prodigious numbers. The tiny larvae drift with the currents, often settling to mature on sites many miles from the parents.\nAlthough numbering just a few hundred species, the group of mollusks known as the cephalopods includes many members that are impressive in size and habits.

I started from supernaturalism. I studied modern science, and that's what turned me into a naturalist. It's not as if I didn't fully consider the problem of supernaturalism. I clung to supernaturalism because I wanted it to be true. But in studying evolutionary biology, I found I simply couldn't hold to my belief because the evidences for naturalism were too great.\nSo, for me, the size of the leap of faith that is required to believe in naturalism is small. Phil tells you it's very large indeed. I guess for him it's only a small leap of faith to believe in a benevolent God who answers prayers, and who gives us all these other things. And that's just a little leap of faith! To me that's a giant leap of faith compared with believing in naturalism.\nI would like to hear from this audience, on the count of three, how many of you believe all animals and plants were created by God within the last ten thousand years. All right, now from those who believe evolution occurred over very long time periods, but God guided this process. It seems, from the show of hands, that evolutionary theists are few and far between. Lastly, who in this audience believes that evolution occurred over three and one- half billion years ago by totally natural processes? The young earth creationists win that poll.\nI thought I would discuss Phil's views on mechanisms of evolution, but unfortunately he said not one word about it, and if you ask him questions about it, that's exactly what you'll get in response: blank, blank, blank.\nI thought Phil's critique of the California Science Museum exhibit was terrific. Only he just didn't go far enough, because many of those exhibits are much worse than he knows. I went through the one at the Royal Ontario Museum and that showed the mollusks evolving only once, and the exhibit showed a bunch of modern mollusks. Well, the mollusk expert I know the best, Arthur J.

If you aren't actually aiming where you think you are then the chances of the ball going in the hole are slim, even before you factor in break, speed and stroke.\nThis is a problem exacerbated by the different putting styles adopted by golfers, placing their eyes behind, directly over or in front of the ball.\nCleveland's TFi 2135 putters address this problem with what it's calling a revolutionary new alignment technology that allows golfers to correctly align their putt regardless of how they set-up.\nTraditionally on blade style putters the alignment aid has been located on the bottom flange of the club, that is by design close to the ground, and has been accepted as proper for alignment in this type of putter.\nHowever in this position you are only truly aligned square to the target if your eyes are located directly over the ball. Any divergence from this, Cleveland says, actually leads to your perception of correct alignment being off.\nThis has been addressed in the TFi putters by raising the height of the sightline by 21.35 mm which equates to the exact height of the centre of the golf ball from the ground.\nBy placing the alignment line directly behind the centre radius of the ball it allows golfers eyes to send correct alignment signals to the brain regardless of their set-up position.\nThis unique alignment is backed up with Cleveland's True Feel Innovation, or TFi for short, that we first encountered in the TFi Smart Square Putter.\nTFi combines two elements in the face of the club to produce a putter that has a consistent feel and performance across the hitting area.\nFirstly, and most strikingly, is the milled copper infused face cap. This distinctive layer gives the player immediate feedback for both sound and feel when they hit the ball.\nThis is backed up by a co-polymer insert that is stationed directly behind the metal face and which Cleveland says provides feel and consistency across the face.\nThe TFi 2135 putters come in three models, the 1.0, the 6.5 and the 8.0.\nThe TFi 2135 1.0 is a classic blade putter with a Plumer's Neck hosel as is the TFi 8.0 which stands out as it is a counterbalanced model with a longer shaft and grip.

Water is no longer water and salt is not salt anymore. This combination produces a ocean of pure energy for your body.\nHow to Make Sole Water\nEveryone knows that salt dissolves in water, right? But did you know that if you keep adding salt to a glass of water you’ll get to a point where the water becomes super-salty or saturated with salt? Did you also know that when the water becomes super-salty or saturated with salt that the salt will just sit on the bottom of the glass without dissolving? This is exactly what the Original Himalayan Crystal Salt® Sole is, super-saturated, salty water.\nPlace 1 inch of Original Himalayan Crystal Salt® stones in a glass jar, preferably one with a lid. Add 2 to 3 inches of good quality artesian or spring water above the stones, completely covering the crystals with water. Let sit overnight. If all the salt crystals have dissolved, add a few more salt crystals to the water. Your Original Himalayan Crystal Salt® Sole is ready when the water becomes fully saturated with salt and cannot hold any more.\nThe salt will no longer dissolve at this stage. Your finished Sole should resemble the photo above. There should always be salt crystals in the jar. As you use up the Original Himalayan Crystal Salt® Sole, after some time, add more water and more salt until the water is again saturated. Remember, there should always be undissolved salt crystals on the bottom of the jar. This is your visual proof that the water is totally saturated with salt.\nEach morning, before eating or drinking anything, add one teaspoon of the Original Himalayan Crystal Salt® Sole to a glass of artesian or spring water and drink. Your body will receive the energetic vibration pattern of the Original Himalayan Crystal Salt® and hold it for 24 hours. Keep the container covered to prevent the water from evaporating. Otherwise, no special storage is needed.\nThe fully saturated Original Himalayan Crystal Salt® Sole will keep forever! Salt is a natural anti-bacterial and natural fungicide.

This is how sea salt, especially the very flaky fleur de sel, is grown. You get some extra salty sea water and slowly allow the salt to evaporate. As the water disappears, the salt has nowhere to go, so much of it starts to form big crystalline flakes. Because the process is so slow and chaotic, the flakes are not as regular of a shape as you would get with something more controlled.\nIf you want to ensure a certain type of crystal is formed, then you can add a seed crystal. If you have a crystal with the right pattern already, adding it to the supersaturated solution will encourage crystals of that structure to form instead of other potential crystalline structures. Because, as I mentioned earlier, if the atoms join with the winning molecule, they are more likely to win. We like rooting for the underdog, but the chances of the underdog beating the favorite are slim. It's the same with crystals. If there's someone really strong and stable out there, adding together with that is much more likely than some other random crystalline structure just popping up randomly.\nIt's this joining mentality, incidentally, that makes some steps of candy-making kind of tricky. If you are trying to make a caramel, for example, you are boiling down water that contains sugar. This makes a supersaturated solution, which will want to make crystals if it either loses enough water or if it encounters another crystal. If you let sugar crystals form on the sides of the pan above where the bulk of your sugar water is, you could be in trouble. All it would take is one of those crystals to fall in the solution, and crystals would form everywhere. Then you would not have tasty caramel. You want the sugar water to stay fluid until you add extra liquid and fat in, then you can have nice, chewy caramel.\nSo, we know that the salt is in different sized crystals, and that is the biggest difference between the table salt and kosher salt. The reason why it's a difference is because of the stability of those crystals.

You may think this is a bit weird to have enjoyment in such thing, but it simply fascinates me from all sorts of angles.\nDeliquescence – What Is It?\nTo begin with, deliquescence is a perfectly natural process in some materials that adsorb moisture. There is a natural tendency for materials to adsorb and release moisture depending on the surrounding relative humidity (%RH). Some materials that have a high solubility in water adsorb moisture from the air and the molecules at the surface dissolve in this moisture. As more moisture is adsorbed, more of the material dissolves and this can continue until all the material turns into a liquid solution of the substance.\nIn Nature this phenomenon is exploited by some organisms for their survival. House mites will only thrive above a certain level of humidity and that is determined by deliquescence of a Na and K salt combination and the liquid draining into the mouth of the mite. The Atacama Desert, located in northern Chile, is accepted as being the driest and oldest part of our planet. Microbiologists have studied the bacteria and fungi from this region since the 1960’s. One area of scientific research has been studies on microorganisms in halite crustal deposits in evaporated lakes and salts within rocks where moisture can penetrate. Deliquescence of these salts is transient occurring when moist air from the Pacific Ocean is carried in land, but sufficient to provide a source of water for microorganisms.\nRock Salt – An Unexpected Discovery\nSo how can we use this phenomenon of deliquescence in practical ways? Let us take a look at what happens to rock salt. In this example a candle holder made from rock salt, but this is also applies to rock salt lamps. Compositional analysis of the well-known Pink Himalaya Rock Salt shows it to be about 38.6% sodium. A quick chemical calculation tells us that NaCl is made up of 39.3% sodium. The difference in rock salt from pure NaCl is less than 1% of other minerals.\nA Christmas present of two rock candle holders were left sitting on a glass table.

Thank you.\nBorek is wrong, to the point of ridiculousosity. (yeah, I made that word up) Of course there are particles of ionic, as well as covalent compounds. One term for it is \"dust\". Anyone living by the ocean is aware that salt spray can deposit fine particles (crystals) of salt. (Which is another, more common, term for them).(Not saying they're pure or anything.)\nThe crystals or particles themselves will be almost electrically neutral...I say \"almost\" because friction and particle impacts can dislodge electrons (temporarily) and create charge (so can ionizing radiation, if you want a stretch). But lets ignore that effect.\nSo, what we have is a material composed of positive charge centers and negative charge centers (anions and cations). Any charge separation creates what we call an electric dipole, which is an electric field. Cut to the chase and the charge separation will on average create an attractive force between particles, BUT the strength of this force is miniscule for any particle that you can see. That is, its only important for distances on the order of the size of small molecules. So, yeah you can have attractive forces, but unless the two surfaces are very close together, the + and - charges interior to them 'average out' and result in virtually no net force. IOW yes but only if the two particles are very very close to one another. Look up Intermolecular Forces, London Forces, or Dispersion Forces on wikipedia.

Folklore stories from almost every culture have their own version of how the ocean became salty. Although they are fun to read, the truth is in fact best explained by simple science. The very short answer to your question is, salt found in ocean water comes from land. Strange, but true! Let us see how that happens.\nThe first thing we should ask ourselves is \"what is salt?\" Salt, found as Sodium Chloride (NaCl) is composed of Sodium (Na) and Chloride (Cl) and accounts for up to 85% of the solids in ocean water. It is essential for all life to survive and in fact, 97% of all water found on Earth is salt water! An estimate made by the US Geological Survey says that if we took out all of this salt and laid it evenly on all the land on Earth, it would be around 500 feet high! So where did all this salt come from and how did it get into the water?\nWe know that the atmosphere consists of Oxygen and Carbon Dioxide (CO2) besides many other gases. Similar to how CO2 is dissolved in soda to create a fizz, atmospheric CO2 dissolves with rain (very little, so we do not see a fizz) and results in the formation of carbonic acid. This leads to rainwater being slightly acidic so when it falls on land, it physically and chemically erodes rocks by carrying salts and other constituents like calcium, magnesium and bicarbonate with it into water bodies such as streams and rivers. The water from these bodies eventually ends up in the ocean where all the salts and minerals dissolve into ocean water. Processes like evaporation and consumption by microorganisms leads to many of the other constituents being taken out of the water, but the salt remains. As the processes of evaporation and condensation take over, the amount of salt in the ocean keeps getting higher and higher.", "score": 0.840618312, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:f36eed8d-bc6f-403c-80be-d4f622ddd1fe>", "text": "How do you know when to use Dear Sir or Madam or something else?

The terms of the armistice called for handing over the ships of the French Navy to Germany. But Darlan ordered all ships then in the Atlantic ports (which Germany would soon occupy) to steam to French overseas possessions, out of the Germans' reach.\nIn the final days before the French surrender Darlan had met the British prime minister Winston Churchill and had promised him: \"No French ship will ever come into the hands of the Germans.\"\nDarlan expected Germany to win the war and saw it as to France's advantage to collaborate with Germany. He distrusted the British, and after the armistice of June 1940 he seriously considered waging a naval war against Britain. As a top official in the Vichy government, Darlan repeatedly offered Hitler active military cooperation against Britain. Hitler, however, distrusted France and wanted it to remain neutral during his planned attack on the Soviet Union in 1941. After the British victory in the Syria–Lebanon Campaign of June-July 1941 and Hitler's failure to defeat the Soviets quickly, Darlan moved away from his policy of collaboration.\nThe British worried that Germany would obtain the French fleet. Darlan repeatedly refused British requests to place the whole fleet in British custody (or in the French West Indies). This led to Operation Catapult, when British forces attacked and destroyed part of the French fleet at Mers-el-Kébir in North Africa (3 July 1940). Thereafter, French forces loyal to Vichy (most of them under Darlan's command) fiercely resisted British moves into French territory, and sometimes cooperated with German forces. However, as Darlan had promised, no capital ships fell into German hands, and only three destroyers and a few dozen submarines and smaller vessels passed into German control.\nBy 1941 Darlan had become Pétain's most trusted associate. In February 1941 Darlan replaced Pierre-Étienne Flandin as \"Vice President of the Council\" (prime minister). He also became Minister of Foreign Affairs, Minister of the Interior, and Minister of National Defence, making him the de facto head of the Vichy government. On 11 February he was named Pétain's eventual successor, in accordance with Act Number Four of the constitution.", "score": 0.811017692, "source": "dense"}]}

Britain and France held staff talks in 1936, the first such since 1918, and British leaders made vague statements about their security being tied to that of France. Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain finally declared in February 1939 that an attack on France would be regarded as an attack on Britain. But only after the Germans ignored the Munich agreement and occupied the remainder of Czechoslovakia in March 1939 did the British government come around to view appeasement as a failure – though not before the Bank of England handed over £5.6 million in gold that the Czechs had sent to London to keep it safe from the Nazis.\nBritain and France did not have a formal alliance until they both declared war on Nazi Germany on 3 September 1939. How sure could the French leadership be, that Britain would follow them into a war with Germany over Poland?\nAmong the various steps in Britain’s appeasement strategy, under the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 1935 Great Britain accepted German naval construction up to a total of 35 percent of Britain’s total tonnage in most warship categories. Not coincidentally, that 35 percent exactly matched France’s allotment under the Washington naval limitations treaty; the British made the pact without consulting the French, and signed it on the 120th anniversary of the Battle of Waterloo.\nBy 1939, that agreement had resulted in the French and German fleets neatly matching one another, at least in terms of heavier ships. The French still had an edge in the lighter categories, and the Germans had nothing to match the huge French destroyers of the contre-torpilleurs type.\nFrench destroyer Le Malin.\nForce de Raid leaves the French to face the Germans alone in September 1939, with the French ships found in the Bismarck game (the remainder are presumably deployed in the Mediterranean to face the Italians). They have two battlecruisers, smaller than full-sized battleships with lighter main armament but good speed. The Germans likewise have two such ships. They have two old battleships not suitable for many duties other than convoy escort; the Germans have two armored cruisers not suitable for many duties other than convoy raiding. Both fleets have two light cruisers; the Germans have eight destroyers and the French have twelve.", "score": 0.798644483, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:e42b3504-c16a-4be3-996c-1557fd16f6c3>", "text": "This page uses content from Wikipedia and is licensed under CC BY-SA.\n|Builder:||At.&Ch de St. Nazaire-Penhoet (St. Nazaire, France)|\n|Laid down:||21 September 1933|\n|Launched:||24 March 1936|\n|Commissioned:||15 November 1937|\n|Decommissioned:||1 May 1957|\n|Nickname(s):||(in English) \"George's Legs\"|\n|Fate:||Sold for scrap in November 1959|\n|Class and type:||La Galissonnière-class cruiser|\n|Length:||179 m (587 ft)|\n|Beam:||17.5 m (57 ft)|\n|Draught:||5.35 m (17.6 ft)|\n|Speed:||31 knots (57 km/h)|\n|Aircraft carried:||up to 4 GL-832, later 2 Loire 130 flying boats|\n|Aviation facilities:||1 catapult|\nGeorges Leygues was a French light cruiser of the La Galissonnière class. During World War II, she served with both Vichy France and Allies. She was named for the prominent 19th and 20th century French politician Georges Leygues.\nAt the start of World War II, she was assigned to the Force de Raid, patrolling the Atlantic in response to German commerce raids. The only incident, however, was when the French submarine Casabianca was shelled in error. To pre-empt the potential Italian threat, Georges Leygues and other French warships were moved to Mers-el-Kebir (now Oran) on 24 April 1940.\nThe 3rd and 4th Cruiser Divisions, including Georges Leygues avoided the destruction of the French Fleet at Mers-el-Kebir and eventually put into Toulon. On 9 September 1940, she left Toulon with her sister ships Gloire and Montcalm, and passed Gibraltar without being challenged (for which the local British commander, Admiral North, was relieved of his command). The flotilla refuelled at Casablanca and continued to Dakar, arriving on 14 September.", "score": 0.79824692, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:ea44696f-a7b2-4f95-9cce-10b0b340cad9>", "text": "Although it was not part of the Washington Treaty in any way, the American delegates had made it clear that they would not agree to the treaty unless the British ended their alliance with the Japanese. \nIn 1935, the French Navy laid down the battleship Richelieu; combined with the two Dunkerque-class battleships also under construction, which placed the total tonnage over the 70,000-ton limit on new French battleships until the expiration of the treaty. The keel laying of Jean Bart in December 1936, albeit less than three weeks before the treaty expired, increased the magnitude of France's violation by another 35,000 tons. The French government dismissed British objections to the violations by pointing out that Britain had signed the Anglo-German Naval Agreement in 1935, which unilaterally dismantled the naval disarmament clauses of the Treaty of Versailles. German naval rearmament threatened France, and according to the French perspective, if Britain freely violated treaty obligations, France would similarly not be constrained.\nItaly repeatedly violated the displacement limits on individual ships and attempted to remain within the 10,000-ton limit for the Trento-class cruisers built in the mid-1920s. However, by the Zara-class cruisers in the late 1920s and early 1930s, it had abandoned all pretense and built ships that topped 11,000 long tons (11,000 t) by a wide margin. The violations continued with the Littorio-class battleships of the mid-1930s, which had a standard displacement in excess of 40,000 long tons (41,000 t). The Italian Navy nevertheless misrepresented the displacement of the vessels as being within the limits imposed by the treaty.\nThe naval treaty had a profound effect on the Japanese. With superior American and British industrial power, a long war would very likely end in a Japanese defeat. Thus, gaining strategic parity was not economically possible.\nMany Japanese considered the 5:5:3 ratio of ships as another snub by the West, but it can be argued that the Japanese had a greater force concentration than the US Navy or the Royal Navy. The terms also contributed to controversy in high ranks of the Imperial Japanese Navy between the Treaty Faction officers and their Fleet Faction opponents, who were also allied with the ultranationalists of the Japanese army and other parts of the Japanese government.", "score": 0.798199534, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:d046a95b-0596-4f8c-a487-7904ccaa3474>", "text": "- Category : 1876-births\n- Type : PE\n- Profile : 3/5 - Martyr / Heretic\n- Definition : Split - Large\n- Incarnation Cross : RAX Unexpected 1\nGerman military, an Admiral, Commander in Chief 1928-1943.

Thus in 1930 the Reinforcement Plan was evolved.\" (C-135) The extract further shows that Hitler had made a clear political request to build up for him in five years, that is, by April 1938, [Page 851] armed forces which he could place in the balance as an instrument of political power. (C-135) The Nazi seizure of power in 1933 was a signal to Raeder to go full speed ahead on rearmament. In June 1934 Raeder told Hitler that the German fleet must be developed to oppose England, and that therefore from 1936 on, the big ships must be armed with big guns to match the British \"King George\" class of battleship. Raeder also went along with Hitler's demand that the construction of U-Boats should be kept completely secret, especially in view of the Saar plebiscite (C-189). In November 1934 Raeder had a further talk with Hitler on the financing naval rearmament, and on that occasion Hitler told him that in case of need he would get Doctor Ley to put 120,000,000 to 160,000,000 RM. from the Labor Front at the disposal of the Navy. (C-190) Another example of the deceit used by Raeder in building up the German Navy is the fact that the true displacement of certain German battleships exceeded by twenty percent the displacement which the Nazis had reported to the British (C- 23). In similar vein, it was ordered that auxiliary cruisers, which were being secretly constructed, should be referred to as \"transport ships O.\" (C-166) The support given by the German Navy to the German Armament Industry illustrates Raeder's concern with the broader aspects of Nazi policy and of the close link between Nazi politicians, German Service Chiefs, and German armament manufacturers.

Robert Gilbert Vansittart, First Baron Vansittart (1881-1957), a right-wing conservative, was Permanent Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs during 1930-38, and was virulently anti-German, rather than just anti-Nazi.\n7. Hitler gave a major speech on foreign policy to the Reichstag on 21 May 1935. This was in response to a meeting of British, French and Italian leaders in Stresa on 11 April 1935 which upheld the Locarno agreement on West European borders, to the recently-signed Franco-Soviet pact of mutual assistance, and to the League of Nations’ condemnation of Germany for its reintroduction of military conscription.\n8. The Royal British Legion sent a delegation to Germany in July 1935, which was manipulated by the Nazi government into a propaganda show of friendship for the Third Reich. Edward Albert Christian George Andrew Patrick David (1894-1972), great-grandson of Queen Victoria, became Prince of Wales in 1911, and King Edward VIII in January 1936.

Its intentions were to govern without – indeed against – the Social Democrats and the unions, to scrap the remaining social gains of 1918, especially the eight-hour day, to cut real wages further, and to force the French government and its allies to accept a drastic reduction of reparations payments.\nBy the Treaty of Versailles the German state was obliged to pay, in annual instalments, ‘reparations’ for war damage, mainly to France and Belgium. The total to be paid, 132 billion gold marks – in other words, marks at their 1914 value, vastly higher than the already heavily depreciated currency of 1919 – indicates less the massive size of this burden than does the fact that the ‘reparations’ included the handing over of one quarter of Germany’s total coal output.\nIt was on the coal deliveries that Cuno defaulted, hoping to force a negotiated reduction. The equally right-wing French government, headed by Poincare, retaliated by sending its army into the Ruhr in January 1923, supported by Belgian forces, to take the coal themselves. Two days later the German government called for ‘passive resistance and non-cooperation’ with the occupying forces. It hoped not only to embarrass the French but also to whip up nationalist hysteria and thus weaken the German workers’ resistance to the right. At first it had some success in this.\nThe KPD responded well. When Cuno demanded a vote of confidence in the Reichstag for his policy and for ‘national unity’, the handful of KPD deputies voted alone against it. The party line was summed up in the slogan ‘Hit Poincaré on the Ruhr and Cuno on the Spree’, meaning in Berlin.\nThe Comintern organised a campaign of international solidarity. The French Communist Party (PCF), from which Frossard and his friends had just split, organised a vigorous campaign.\n‘On January 18, 19 and 20, thirty meetings were organised in different quarters of Paris protesting [against] the occupation of the Ruhr.

Scanned, prepared and annotated for the Marxist Internet Archive by Paul Flewers.\nThe Hoare – Ribbentrop Naval Agreement  has brought the British-German alliance into the open. The March German Military Law was still in form a unilateral action of Germany alone declaring its independence of the military clauses of Versailles; although the complicity of Britain was in fact demonstrated by the immediately following Simon’s  visit to Berlin, Britain had in form to unite with France and Italy at Stresa and Geneva in condemning any such unilateral violation and pledging common action to prevent any future similar action. But with the Naval Agreement Britain and Germany for the first time openly join hands, in defiance of the opposition of France, Italy and the United States, to smash Stresa and the plans of a collective European settlement, and to force up German armaments by British support in an exclusive agreement directly censured and disapproved by every other power. This is a big step towards an open alliance, and the subsequent Eden visits to Paris and Rome have only emphasised, rather than succeeded in masking, the significance of this alignment, which is enormously increasing the war menace of the present international situation.\nAt the outset it is important to note the peculiar character of this Naval Agreement, which was concluded with extreme speed from the opening of the negotiations on 3 June to its conclusion on 18 June, and was actually concluded immediately after the reception of the very sharp French Note of protest on 17 June.\nIn order to understand its significance it is necessary to recall two facts. First, when Simon reported to the House of Commons Hitler’s demand at the Berlin conversations for 35 per cent of the British naval strength, he stated as an obvious commonplace that such a demand was ‘inadmissible’. This was the universal tone in the British press; even the pro-Hitler Times explained in its issue of 18 April that ‘the one-third claim would eventually bring German naval strength close to the strength which Great Britain maintains in home waters’. Second, the announcement of German submarine building, made at the end of April, aroused a universal outcry of alarm and panic in the House of Commons and the press; it was declared ‘the gravest moment since 1909’, etc.", "score": 0.792932034, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:ef6b774d-0e0a-492b-8951-10673d458b23>", "text": "The collaboration of British imperialism with the Hitler offensive has now come into the open in a more marked form than at any time previously, and it must be evident to the most sceptical that the main point of this collaboration is directed against the Soviet Union.

This was the Anglo-German Naval Agreement of 18 June 1935, a bilateral agreement between the United Kingdom and German Reich regulating the size of the German Navy (Kriegsmarine) in relation to the Royal Navy, with the former’s total tonnage to be on a permanent basis 35 per cent of the total tonnage of the latter. The agreement allowed Germany to go beyond the naval restrictions decreed in the Versailles Treaty, and it was reached without any consulting with France and Italy.\n2. John Allsebrook Simon, First Viscount Simon (1873-1954) was a National Liberal member of the various National Governments during the 1930s, serving as Foreign Secretary during 1931-35. He held a minor post in Churchill’s wartime government.\n3. Winston Churchill (1874-1965) was at this point a Conservative MP, but not a member of the National Government. His attitude towards fascism was ambiguous; he openly admired Mussolini, but his wariness about the revival of German imperialism under Hitler led him to accuse the National Government of downplaying the threat that it presented to British imperial interests. Sir Joseph Austen Chamberlain (1863-1937), half-brother of Neville Chamberlain (British Prime Minister during 1937-40), was a Conservative MP but not a member of the National Government. Like Churchill, he was concerned about the threat posed by Nazi Germany to British imperial interests.\n4. Robert Anthony Eden (1897-1977) was a Conservative MP during 1923-57, and Foreign Secretary during 1935-38, resigning in protest at the National Government’s attitude towards Nazi Germany. He was Foreign Secretary during 1940-45 and 1951-55, and Prime Minister during 1955-57, resigning in the aftermath of the Suez débâcle.\n5.", "score": 0.20573567807231286, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:f26fcfe1-c6e4-4081-8ea2-38212ad86463>", "text": "The American involvement in North Africa helped expelling German and Italian forces from the region, and from there the invasion of Sicily toppled Benito Mussolini's regime.

The campaign in France marked the beginning of the end of Germany.\nIn the east, after losing Malaya and Singapore, the United Kingdom also lost Burma to the Japanese. The Japanese Navy posed a threat, too, after its successful excursion into the Indian Ocean. But the Commonwealth of India supported by the United Kingdom held fast, preventing Japan from entering India.\nWhen WW2 ended, the United Kingdom emerged victorious but she was financially damaged.

First, it means at once an increase in the French naval programme. It will be remembered that the original Washington Naval Treaty fixed the French proportion at 35 per cent of British, in respect of capital ships. The new German navy will not be equal to the French, but in the North Sea it will be superior, owing to the division of the French ships in other seas. The virtual parity to the British fleet in home waters becomes superiority to the French. This will inevitably mean an increase in the French building programme. But this in turn will disturb the Washington proportions of the French fleet to the British and American, and will be replied to by corresponding increases in Britain and the United States. Thus the new Agreement opens a new naval armament race.\nOn the diplomatic side, the rupture of Stresa will have inevitable effects on French and Italian policy. ‘M Laval  considers that henceforth he will be free to break with the usual practice of acquainting in advance the British government with every important movement of French diplomacy.’ (Daily Telegraph, 20 June 1935) In particular, French policy moves to support of Italy against Britain on the question of Abyssinia. The smashing by Britain of the 3 February line of an integral settlement for Europe as a whole means at once the hastening of every separate move of war-preparation in accordance with the Anglo-German principle of ‘localised wars’.\nThus the situation is rendered increasingly serious by the most recent events. Japan goes forward with its war of conquest on North China, with a considerable degree of British complaisance, as indicated by Hoare’s answers in parliament and his highly congratulatory speech at a dinner to the Japanese ambassador immediately after the new aggression. The German armament and aggression plans in Europe go forward with open British support. The British government now feels sufficiently strong, in unison with the rapidly growing German military power, to take a more and more openly defiant line, and counts on forcing the acquiescence of France, utilising also the threat of Locarno  in order to paralyse the Franco-Soviet Pact, and thus to isolate the Soviet Union.", "score": 0.019798540616315963, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:1a315ec4-a88d-459a-b500-92eb5040273f>", "text": "Germany Table of Contents\nForeign policy in the Wilhelmine Era (1890-1914) turned away from Bismarck's cautious diplomacy of the 1871-90 period. It was also marked by a shrill aggressiveness. Brusque, clumsy diplomacy was backed by increased armaments production, most notably the creation of a large fleet of battleships capable of challenging the British navy. This new bellicosity alarmed the rest of Europe, and by about 1907 German policy makers had succeeded in creating Bismarck's nightmare: a Germany \"encircled\" by an alliance of hostile neighbors--in this case Russia, France, and Britain--in an alliance called the Triple Entente.\nThe first brick to fall out of Bismarck's carefully crafted edifice was Germany's Reinsurance Treaty with Russia. Harmed by Prussian trade policies, Russia did not renew the treaty and instead turned to France for economic assistance and military security. The two countries formally allied in early 1893. Britain joined them in 1907, even though France and Britain had nearly gone to war over a colonial dispute in 1898. Britain's main reason for abandoning its usual posture as an aloof observer of developments on the continent was Germany's plan to build a fleet of sixty battleships of the formidable Dreadnought class.\nThe German naval expansion program had many domestic supporters. The kaiser deeply admired the navy of his grandmother, Queen Victoria of Britain, and wanted one as large for himself. Powerful lobbying groups in Germany desired a large navy to give Germany a worldwide role and to protect a growing German colonial empire in Africa and the Pacific. Industry wanted large government contracts. Some political parties promoted naval expansion and an aggressive foreign policy to win votes from a nervous electorate they kept worked up with jingoistic rhetoric.\nThe chief figure in promoting the naval buildup was Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, who is considered the founder of the modern German navy. Tirpitz was an effective spokesman for the program and had the ear of the kaiser and his advisers. In 1898, after the Reichstag passed the first Naval Bill, Anglo-German relations deteriorated. The Supplementary Naval Act of 1900 further strained relations with Britain, as did a proposed Berlin-Baghdad railroad through the Ottoman Empire, a project that threatened British as well as Russian interests in the Balkans.", "score": 0.018641331306646122, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:405a2cb2-0fb2-4530-a45e-bb4a0175b788>", "text": "The depressed state of the British economy continued until 1937, when it underwent a new crisis. State capitalist tendencies and the concentration of capital were intensified in Britain’s economy; industry was supported more and more by military procurement orders. During the 1930’s there was widespread acceptance of the idea of state regulation of the economy in order to rescue it from crises.\nBritain’s foreign policy after World War I in its relation to the other imperialist powers was characterized by a sharpening of Anglo-American, Anglo-Japanese, and Anglo-French contradictions. The struggle with France for the leading role in Europe, along with considerations of an anti-Soviet policy, determined the actions of the British government in European affairs during the 1920’s (Anglo-German contradictions were weakened for some time by Germany’s military defeat). Together with the USA, Britain facilitated the recovery of German military-industrial potential, taking an active part in working out the Dawes Plan (1924) and in financing the German economy. However, insofar as the strengthening of Germany’s military might increased the threat to Britain’s international position, it led to the growth of Anglo-German contradictions. The reactionary ruling circles of Britain conceived the idea of “channeling” Hitler’s aggression to the East; this was linked not only with plans to annihilate the USSR but also to weaken Germany. The policy with regard to Nazi Germany that was conducted during the 1930’s by British Conservative cabinets (S. Baldwin’s, 1935-37, and N. Chamberlain’s, 1937-40) and that was termed the policy of “non-interference” and “appeasement,” did in fact constitute a policy of encouraging fascist aggression. By signing the Anglo-German Maritime Agreement of 1935, Britain was actually assisting the rebirth of the German naval fleet. The policy of “non-interference” also facilitated aggression by other imperialist states (Japan in the Far East and Italy in Africa). At the same time, with the acquiescence of British ruling circles fascist and profascist elements became active within the country (led by O. Mosley), advocating collaboration with Nazi Germany.

Chamberlain proceeded to conclude the Munich Agreement of 1938, which dismembered Czechoslovakia in Germany’s favor; also signed in 1938 was an Anglo-German declaration that was equivalent to a nonaggression pact between Britain and Germany.", "score": 0.0020509933335371225, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:34b15fed-d151-48e0-ae4a-309a06e4ee11>", "text": "The capture of German Samoa\nBefore the outbreak of war, Prime Minister William Massey had made it clear that New Zealand’s main contribution would be supplying troops to the major theatre of conflict. After 5 August 1914, preparations to do this began rapidly. But before New Zealand could commit its troops to Europe, any direct threat in the Pacific region had to be removed. The first objective was to capture German Samoa.\nThe Germans had established a wireless station at Apia in Samoa. On 6 August, the British informed the New Zealand government that the capture of German Samoa would be a ‘great and urgent Imperial service’. Australian intelligence advised that a German-officered constabulary of around 80 men and a gunboat protected the station. This was no match for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) of about 1400 men, led by Colonel Robert Logan, which achieved its objective without resistance on 29 August. This was the second German territory, after Togoland in Africa, to fall to the Allies in the First World War.\nOn 23 August, Japan declared war on Germany, assuring the Allies of naval dominance in the Pacific. The Japanese quickly set about capturing German territories north of the Equator.\nAfter a delay while a stronger naval escort could be arranged, the main body of the NZEF left New Zealand on 16 October 1914. Most thought they were headed to fight in France but this changed when the Ottoman Empire (Turkey) entered the war on the side of the Central Powers on 5 November.\nNew Zealand and Australian troops disembarked in Egypt to complete their training. From here, they headed to the Gallipoli Peninsula, Turkey, in April 1915. Some 2779 New Zealanders died during this unsuccessful campaign.\nAfter their evacuation from Gallipoli, New Zealand troops were sent to the Western Front (France and Belgium). The Gallipoli campaign and the birth of the Anzac legend have captured the imagination of generations of New Zealanders. But it is on the killing fields of the Western Front that most New Zealanders saw action and where most of them died – almost 12,500 in total.\nIn addition, a mounted rifles brigade participated in the Sinai–Palestine campaign.

Britain had a long tradition of being the master of the seas. Germany knew it was unlikely to win a naval war against Britain’s mighty naval fleet and tended to avoid open naval conflict with Britain on the surface of the ocean.\nThe 1916 Battle of Jutland was the largest naval battle of the First World War and involved 250 British and German combat ships.

The former is an artificial gem, whereas the latter is a natural gemstone formed by geological processes. These processes differ significantly, but most people can’t tell the difference between the two. Read on to learn more about these two diamonds. They are both made by the same manufacturing process, but they have very different characteristics.\nWhile many consumers consider lab-grown diamonds to be “cheap,” more people, particularly millennials and those aged between 21 and 40, are willing to pay up to 30% less for one. The price is crucial in their popularity; they are up to three times cheaper than comparable natural diamonds. This price difference is due in part to the sticker shock that comes with buying natural diamonds. Additionally, lab-grown diamonds are much more similar in appearance than natural ones, making them a good option if you can’t afford the wild variety.\nIf you’re considering purchasing a lab-grown diamond, the first thing to do is make sure that it has been graded by a reputable laboratory. It is easy to become a victim of diamond ripoffs. If you are looking to purchase a lab-created diamond, make sure you choose a trustworthy seller. James Allen is one such company. It guarantees a fair price for its products.\nThe process for making a lab-grown diamond is similar to that of growing a natural diamond. The tiny seed is exposed to an environment rich in carbon and heat. This results in the formation of a perfect carbon crystal. While the latter is not entirely natural, the process used to grow a lab-grown diamond is incredibly accurate. In fact, the two are nearly identical. Despite the fact that they are grown in a laboratory, they are still considered a diamond.\nWhile the beauty of lab-grown diamonds is unmatched, their lack of transparency is not as appealing to consumers. The 4Cs, or carats, are not the only factors to look at when buying a diamond. The 4Cs are the most important criteria for a diamond and should be a primary consideration when buying a diamond. These are the characteristics that separate natural diamonds from lab-grown ones.\nAnother difference between natural and lab-grown diamonds is the process of creating them. Both types of diamonds are created with the same seed crystal, but they may not have the same characteristics of the natural ones.", "score": 0.887369692, "source": "dense"}]}

The vocal cords become inflamed and the swelling distorts the sounds produced by passing air. The quality of the voice becomes hoarse or gravelly-sounding and sometimes too quiet and soft to hear. Laryngitis can either be short-lived (Acute Laryngitis) or it can last over a long period of time (Chronic Laryngitis). Causes of laryngitis include: Upper respiratory infection/cold, overuse of the voice box by excess talking, singing, or shouting, gastroesophageal reflux disease(GERD), chronic irritation of the vocal cords, smoking, and exposure to second-hand smoke/polluted air.\nLaryngitis is a condition where the voice box is inflamed. This condition can be obtained by infection, irritation or overuse of the voice box. The vocal chords usually open and close while forming sound with their movements and vibrations. Laryngitis is when the vocal chords swell up and this causes it to change the sound that is created. There are two types of laryngitis; Acute and Chronic. Acute is a short-lived case of laryngitis and Chronic is a case that lasts over 3 weeks. This condition is not life threatening and is not very serious.\nLaryngitis is an inflammation of your larynx or voice box, caused by a large amount of use of the voice box, or can result from an infection. When affected by laryngitis, the vocal cords become very inflamed and irritated. This inflammation makes the infected person’s voice sound odd and different.\nHow does Laryngitis Affect the Respiratory System?\nLaryngitis affects the respiratory system because the infection from the vocal chords can easily affect and spread to the other parts of the respiratory system.\nLaryngitis is connected to the respiratory system as laryngitis directly changes the respiratory system’s ability to work properly, as it makes the victim’s voice distorted and gives them a hacking cough.\nSigns and Symptoms\nThe most common symptoms of laryngitis are: hoarseness, loss of voice, and a tickling sensation and rawness in the throat.

It plays a crucial role in supplying oxygen to our cells while eliminating carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular respiration. Let’s explore the key components of the respiratory system and their functions:\n- Nasal Cavity:\n- Definition: The nasal cavity is a hollow space behind the nose, lined with mucus-secreting mucosa and tiny hair-like structures called cilia.\n- Function: It filters, warms, and moistens incoming air, removing dust, allergens, and pathogens, thus protecting the respiratory tract.\n- Definition: The pharynx, commonly known as the throat, is a muscular tube located at the back of the nasal cavity and mouth.\n- Function: It serves as a common pathway for both air and food. It plays a role in swallowing as the epiglottis prevents food from entering the trachea.\n- Definition: The larynx, or voice box, is a short passage located below the pharynx, composed of cartilage and vocal cords.\n- Function: It houses the vocal cords responsible for voice production. It also acts as a protective mechanism, closing during swallowing to prevent choking.\n- Definition: The trachea, also called the windpipe, is a rigid tube connecting the larynx to the bronchi.\n- Function: It allows air to pass between the upper respiratory tract and the lungs. Its walls are reinforced with C-shaped cartilage rings, maintaining its structure.\n- Definition: The bronchi are two large branches that arise from the lower end of the trachea, each leading to one lung.\n- Function: They conduct air to and from the lungs, progressively branching into smaller tubes known as bronchioles.\n- Definition: The lungs are the main organs of the respiratory system, consisting of soft, spongy tissue.\n- Function: They are the primary sites of gas exchange. Oxygen from the air is absorbed into the bloodstream, while carbon dioxide is expelled from the bloodstream and exhaled.\n- Definition: Alveoli are tiny, air-filled sacs located at the end of bronchioles within the lungs.\n- Function: They facilitate the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the air in the lungs and the blood capillaries.", "score": 0.835077, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:0cbafc93-8d94-453f-9fed-876fefd691cf>", "text": "Swallowing Mechanism | How it works\nChristina, Speech Therapist with Adaptive Equipment & Caregiving Corner explains the basic structures of the swallowing mechanism and how the swallow works.\nSwallow Mechanism Structures:\n01:26 Vocal cords\n01:58 How the epiglottis protects you\n02:30 How do I clear food or drink from my vallecula?\n02:44 How do I clear food or drink sitting on my vocal cords?\nAdaptive Equipment & Caregiving Corner wants to help improve safety and function for individuals and caregivers during daily care and activities.

In recent studies being conducted at the Marineland aquarium in France, an orca named Wikie was able to mimic certain words like “hello” and “bye-bye”.\nHow were researchers able to tell that Wikie was learning new words? In order to make sure the orca was learning new words, the research was conducted by choosing words the orca had not heard in the past. As heard in the audio clip, the orca “speaks” at a higher frequency, but the words are still understandable.\nHow can orcas mimic human speech? Humans are capable of speaking due to forcing air out of their larynx, a part of the throat that contains vocal cords which vibrate to produce sound, but orcas do not have vocal cords in their larynx. Orcas make sound by moving air in their nasal sacs by their blowhole. Even though humans and orcas both have a larynx, they are used in a different way to make sound.\nWhy did researchers want to see if orcas can mimic human speech? The researchers were interested in this idea since orcas appear to travel in pods in the wild and communicate with one another, but there is no evidence on how this originally started. Due to the orcas being able to mimic human speech, researchers believe there may be ways to learn the ways orcas communicate with one another and eventually understand an orcas’ nature.\nDoes this research mean we can talk to orcas one day? Researcher were quick to point out that orcas may be able to mimic human speech, but there are no results indicating they fully understand the meaning of the words they are saying.\nThe scientists believe that further research may open more possibilities, but this particular study was not enough to understand if humans and orcas can one day communicate through language.

If your son’s voice is suddenly all over the map — oscillating between soprano and bass — it means that some major physical and anatomical changes are on the way. His larynx is growing, and his pitch will eventually drop and your son’s voice will start to change. Say goodbye to that sweet little boy and his sweet little voice, and say hello to your emerging mini man.\nWant to understand how, why, and when this will all happen and need some tips on how to handle this somewhat awkward but oh-so-relatable situation? Here is what you need to know about boys’ voice changes.\nWhy does a boy’s voice change?\nThe gist of it is that surging testosterone causes the larynx and vocal folds to thicken and grow, which deepens the pitch and timbre of a boy’s voice. While a girl’s vocal cords will also grow during puberty, they will generally max out around 10 millimeters, while a boy’s, on the other hand, can get to 16 millimeters. The longer the vocal cords, the deeper the voice.\nWhen does a boy’s voice change?\nThis larynx growth generally starts around the active “Tanner stages” of puberty. This period also aligns with other hormonally driven physical and anatomical changes, too. His Adam’s apple will emerge (this is related to the larynx growth,) and, yes, his genitals are likely changing at this point, too.\nBe aware that while this phase may kick off with a sudden growth spurt (like, you blinked and your kid grew a foot!), the overall change can be gradual. It may start around 11 or 12, and may end between 15 and 18 years of age. No two kids are alike, though, and some boys may go through this earlier or later than others. The whole puberty process can take up to three years. Some boys’ voices may take a while to adjust, while others may shift more quickly.

There are lots of other causes of hoarseness however...one of the more common causes of hoarseness in the morning is something called laryngopharyngeal reflux. When you lie flat at night, gravity is no longer working for you helping to keep your stomach acid in your stomach. This can allow acid to reflux through your esophagus (swallowing tube) up to the level of your larynx. The acid is very irritating to the larynx and can cause edema and erythema within the larynx resulting in hoarseness.

If you've already given it a try, I'm sure you'll agree with me this is an amazing song to sing, but also a tough one. Well, I'm going to share with you some tips and vocal exercises that hopefully will make your life easier and help you to master this emotional ballad.\nIn my opinion \"All Of Me\" presents two main challenges: there are lots of embellishments spread throughout the song, some of which extend to as much as 5 notes, like in the bridge for example when he goes like: \"Give me all of you\". [click on the player below to hear the demonstration]\nSome of the top notes are pretty challenging too and the exercises I'm going to cover will help you to hit those high notes without straining your voice and to increase your vocal agility so that you can nail all the licks John Legend sings so gracefully.\nThere are some pretty high notes in the chorus and bridge of this song, the top one being Ab4. Now, there are a few things that need to happen simultaneously in order to be able to sing those high notes in a comfortable way: first of all we need to make sure that our breathing is under control, using our diaphragm, making sure that the sound is kept away from our throat. The easiest way to control that we're breathing properly is to place our fingers under our last rib and to expand out when we breathe in, and come back to the start position when you breathe out, keeping chest and shoulders relaxed. Also, we need to make sure that the muscles around our larynx are as relaxed as possible and that we lift the soft palate when we're hitting the high notes, so that we can create more room for our voice to resonate and also stabilize our larynx, which shouldn't move too much when we're singing. Now, if you're wondering: \"how do I move my soft palate\"? That's exactly what happens when you're yawning: the roof of your mouth goes up, your larynx moves down. You can also think about swallowing a whole apple, the effect that you get is pretty much the same: your larynx is going to drop slightly.", "score": 0.011568236451149572, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:fec2256f-795b-49dd-805d-2bb5613aa576>", "text": "On one occasion the communicator told me that the medium’s larynx was being used, and that his voice was being carried by a psychic tube to the trumpet, which magnified it so that we could hear it. In other words, he was making use of the medium’s lungs and larynx and mouth to save the necessity of materialising these organs, but even then I did not hear the medium speaking.\nThis information was made clearer by replies to further questions. When a voice speaks through the trumpet it is not always independent of the medium, and does not always proceed from a materialised entity in the centre of the circle. The power is not always strong enough to maintain this form of communication throughout the entire sitting. What happens is this. The communicator who wishes to speak controls the medium and speaks through him. The communicator has not, however, the same control over the medium as his regular controllers, and the voice produced is sometimes not above a whisper. The voice is conveyed from the medium’s mouth by means of a materialised ectoplasmic or psychic tube to the trumpet, which amplifies the voice so that it can be heard. Speaking under these circumstances the speaker stands behind the medium, whose etheric body for the time being is detached from his physical body; in other words the medium is in trance. The communicator is thus able to control the medium’s vocal organs.\nThere is an etheric connecting link, which has the same effect on the medium’s muscles as the atmospheric waves have on two tuning forks tuned to the same pitch. As the vibrations of one act on the other, so the two sets of vocal organs, those of the etheric speaker and those of the medium, act in unison.

It was a fine sunny day and the enemy was unusually quiet until around 7.15 p.m. when they opened a severe bombardment. And then, before the sentries could give the alarm, thick clouds of gas were shot out of cylinder nozzles from the German trenches.

Men were caught by the fumes and in dreadful agony, coughing and vomiting and rolling on the ground.”\nShortly after the attack, the situation was saved by 19 year old Second Lieutenant Robin Kestell-Cornish, who together with the only four men left of his platoon of 40, fired into the gas cloud and stopped the advancing Germans.

He integrated the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League, along with Frank Austin, in 1949. Two years later, he became only the third Puerto Rican to play in the major leagues when he joined the Boston Braves. Although he never found the success in the majors that he had in other leagues, Márquez had a 20-year career in professional baseball.\nHe is the only Puerto Rican with batting titles in Negro League baseball (1947 Homestead Grays, .417), Puerto Rican baseball (1953-54 Mayaguez, .333), and Organized Baseball (1959 Dallas, Triple-A American Association, .345).\nThe nickname “Canena” was bestowed on Márquez him by his mother, Adela, a name by which she had been known. After a truly hot start in a series in the 1944 Amateur World Series in Venezuela, he picked up the nickname “El Fogón Boricua.”4\nAfter he finished high school, an 18-year-old Márquez signed a professional baseball contract with Mayaguez. During his career, Márquez, who was quick and had a strong arm, played in both in the infield and outfield. The 5-foot-10, 174-pound player threw and batted right-handed. Márquez began his professional career with the Mayagüez Indios during the 1944-1945 season. In his first game, Márquez experienced both high and low points – he raced from second to home on an infield out, but he also made two fielding errors.5 Márquez’s career in Puerto Rican winter ball included time with the Mayagüez Indios (1944-1946, 1953-1956, 1957-1964), the Aguadilla Sharks (1946-1951), the San Juan Senators (1952-1953), and the Ponce Lions (1957-1958, and 1959-60, both stints as manager).", "score": 0.824585, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:064777e4-515b-4f43-80f9-ad16537b1ff4>", "text": "During his first professional season in Puerto Rico, Márquez batted .361 and tied with Alfonso Gerard for 1944-45 Rookie of the Year honors.

He hit two home runs in the 1957 Caribbean Championship Series.\nOver the course of 20 seasons in Puerto Rico, Márquez played in 4,018 games; scored 768 runs; registered 1,206 hits which included 235 doubles, 66 triples, and 97 home runs; and batted .300.

He returned to Portland in 1950, played 194 games, hit over .300, and again led the club in stolen bases.

In 1957, when the three-time manager of the Portland Beavers, Bill Sweeney, died, Márquez served as an honorary pallbearer.14\nIn 1951 Márquez finally moved up to the major leagues when he was claimed by the Boston Braves in the Rule 5 draft prior to the season.15 Márquez had joined the Braves one year after Sam Jethroe integrated it, but historian Adrian Burgos has noted that Márquez was the first Afro-Latino player signed by the Braves, and the second one overall (after Minnie Miñoso)16 His major-league debut came on April 18, 1951, when he entered the game against the New York Giants as a pinch-runner for Jim Wilson.17 Márquez’s first hit, a triple, came on April 19 in the second game of a doubleheader against the New York Giants.18 His first RBI followed the next day in a 2-for-4 performance against the Philadelphia Phillies; Márquez drove in the first run and scored the second in a 2-1 Braves victory.

Playing to packed houses, the \"20\"-year-old Valenzuela allowed just four runs while twirling five shutouts in his first eight starts before descending to a mortal level.

Softball players playing the sport professionally are paid about 2,000-5,000 dollars every season. This disparity in the salaries of these sports is mainly accounted for by the fact that baseball has a lot more fans than softball.

Douglas explains in The Secret Horsepower Race:\nToday’s engines are now bearing the fruit of the work done during the Second World War, sometimes through a ‘second discovery’, sometimes through an old idea being rekindled. All Formula One motor-racing engines have the axial swirl throttle which started as a radial design in France and was designed by Daimler and then Mikulin in axial form. It is now normal practice for Grand Prix engines to run at over 130OC coolant temperature, for exactly the same reasons as Professor Messerschmitt complained so bitterly to Milch in 1942, and the water-cooled exhaust valve-guides of the Jumo 213 are to be found in the design of many Formula One Teams.\nCalum E. Douglas, The Secret Horsepower Race, p. 458\nIn The Secret Horsepower Race there is an image on page 425 that shows a German Jumo 213 J connecting rod in a 1945 sketch just above a sketch of a “modern” racing engine connecting rod. Just how similar the two look is very striking and brings home the lesson of just how “advanced” the fighter engines of World War II actually are.\nThe Secret Horsepower Race is certainly a more technical read than I normally undertake. After all, I’m a History major, not an engineer! That said, Mr. Douglas spins a fascinating tale that, though full of technical detail, also has enough history and espionage that it really entertains. I found myself drawn in and slowing to carefully read the account.\nBook to Wargame\nAs I read The Secret Horsepower Race I found myself thinking of several air combat wargames I’ve played.

In addition to automobiles designed for the civilian market, the company also produced racing cars, aircraft engines, armoured cars and other armoured fighting vehicles, the latter continuing long after civilian car production ceased.\nHistory of the companyEdit\nThe original company, T.G. John and Company Ltd., was founded in 1919 by Thomas George John (1880 – 1946). Its first products were stationary engines, carburetors and motorscooters. Following complaints from the Avro aircraft company whose logo bore similarities to the original winged green triangle, the more familiar inverted red triangle incorporating the word \"Alvis\" evolved. On December 14, 1921, the company officially changed its name to The Alvis Car and Engineering Company Ltd. Geoffrey de Freville (1883 – 1965) designed the first Alvis engine and is also responsible for the company name.\nThe origin of the name Alvis has been the subject of a great deal of speculation over the years. Some have suggested that de Freville proposed the name Alvis as a compound of the words \"aluminium\" and \"vis\" (meaning \"strength\" in Latin), or perhaps it may have been derived from the Norse mythological weaponsmith, Alvíss. De Freville however vigorously rejected all of these theories. In 1921, he specifically stated that the name had no meaning whatsoever, and was chosen simply because it could be easily pronounced in any language. He reaffirmed this position in the early 1960s, stating that any other explanations for the source of the name were purely coincidental.\nProduction was relocated to Holyhead Road in Coventry, where from 1922 to 1923 they also made the Buckingham car. In 1922 George Thomas Smith-Clarke (1884 – 1960) left his job as assistant works manager at Daimler and joined Alvis as Chief Engineer and Works Manager.", "score": 0.802869201, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:a71ee7ed-b65f-47b8-80ff-736d909336ef>", "text": "A point that seems to jump out from between the lines in Zemlin's blog entry is that it reflects the growing sentiment within the commercial Linux industry that Apple, and not Microsoft, is the real competitor in the consumer space.

Overhead valve engines are used by most car manufacturers but now only GM and Chrysler produce the \"push-rod\" variant with any great regularity. Since overhead cam engines are design variants of OHV engines, it is fair to classify virtually all modern engines as derivatives of Buick's invention.\nThe money ran out again and in 1903 Buick was forced to raise more money via a $5,000 loan (equal to $131,241 today) from a friend and fellow car enthusiast, Benjamin Briscoe. With this financial help from Briscoe, Buick formed the Buick Motor Company which would eventually become the cornerstone of the General Motors empire.\nLater life and business failure\nIn 1906, Buick accepted a severance package and left the company that he had founded, with only one share of the company in his possession.

Analyzing the chemistry of tiny slivers of fossilized bone can reveal whether a Tyrannosaurus rex was about to lay eggs.\nA female bird that is producing eggs is called “in lay.” And when a bird is in lay, some of her bones temporarily develop a tissue known as medullary (MED-ju-laar-ee) bone. It’s loosely woven with lots of holes, kind of like a sponge. It will fill the regular bones’ inner cavities.\nScientists had hypothesized that dinosaurs might have this tissue, too. In 2005, a team spotted what looked like medullary bone. The team was led by paleontologist Mary Schweitzer of North Carolina State University in Raleigh .A colleague had sent Schweitzer a box filled with 70-million-year-old fossil bones of a T. rex. They had been unearthed in Montana.\nThis dino had been about 18 years old when it died.\n“I pulled the first fragment out and said, ‘Oh my gosh! It’s a girl and it’s pregnant,'” Schweitzer recalls. She had recognized the porous appearance of medullary bone. Of course, she didn’t know then, for sure, that this was what she had found.\nOther bone tissue, such as broken bones that are healing, can mimic the sponge-like look of medullary bone. So Schweitzer’s team tested the T. rex tissue for keratan sulfate. It’s a chemical found in medullary bones but not other types. As suspected, this chemical was present.\nSchweitzer and her colleagues published their results in the March 15 issue of Scientific Reports.\nDetecting medullary bone means that scientists now can identify dinosaurs that were in lay. But to do these analyses takes destroying a little bit of fossil. Plus, there’s still no way to tell males from “non-pregnant” females. But that is the goal, Schweitzer says. Now that she knows this T. rex was a girl, she wants to examine her for other features that might prove to be tell-tale signs of her gender. These might then be used to identify other female T. rexes.\n(for more about Power Words, click here)\nchemistry The field of science that deals with the composition, structure and properties of substances and how they interact with one another.", "score": 0.842650235, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:179c71b9-4884-4402-a87c-bb97218e769e>", "text": "Were dinosaurs warm blooded?

In fact, they may have been warm-blooded, new research suggests.\nThe researchers studied the \"growth lines\" on animal bones, which are similar to the growth rings in tree trunks. During slow-growing times like during the winter, they are darker and narrower, while in fast-growing times the bones have lighter, wider bands.\nFiguring out if dinosaurs were warm-blooded endotherms (made their own body heat) or were \"cold-blooded\" ectotherms that relied on outside sources of warmth could illuminate a lot about how they lived, grew and evolved. How warm an animal is has an impact on their metabolism, and therefore how quickly they can grow and have babies.\nOf bones and blood\nPreviously, scientists had thought that growth lines showed up only on the bones of cold-blooded animals, since these animals grow in fits and starts. Warm-blooded animals, like mammals and birds, are assumed to grow continuously, because they keep their temperatures up and have high metabolic rates, continually making energy to grow.\nAs such, researchers took the growth lines on dinosaur bones as evidence of their cold-bloodedness. Until now.\nIn this study, the researchers compared the bone lines from the leg bones of more than 100 wild ruminants (warm-blooded mammals like sheep and cows that have multiple stomachs) with seasonal rainfall and temperature cycles and with the animal's core body temperature and resting metabolic rate. The researchers showed that these warm-blooded animals also have bone growth lines indicating fast, yet interrupted yearly growth that depended on how long the \"unfavorable\" season lasted. [Image Gallery: Dinosaur Fossils]\nThe growth lines they found on the ruminants were similar to those seen in previous studies of dinosaur bones — indicating that both ruminants and dinosaurs have periods of high growth punctuated by \"unfavorable\" seasons with limited resources and little growth. This means that dinosaurs were likely warm-blooded like the ruminants.", "score": 0.841752589, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:9e14f2b5-c5a2-4c1e-b1fa-8b709f89dd5c>", "text": "Insights into the Evolution of Triceratops\nIt might sound like a Rudyard Kipling “Just So” story but scientists from Montana State University have been working out how Triceratops got its beak and horns. The team of researchers had spent the past fifteen summers mapping and excavating Triceratops skull material from the Badlands of eastern Montana, from the world famous Hell Creek Formation. University PhD candidate John Scannella and his three co-authors have published a paper in the “Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences”, that reports on the study of more than fifty Triceratops specimens and plots how this dinosaur gradually changed over two million years.\nThe team recorded the precise stratigraphic location for each Triceratops fossil. The shape and characteristics of any skull material was then carefully analysed and this permitted the researchers to see evolutionary trends in the Triceratops genus through the Late Maastrichtian faunal stage.\nThe team noted that over one to two million years, the Triceratops skull specimens slowly changed. They went from having a small nose horn and a long beak to having a longer nose horn and a shorter beak. The two recognised species of Triceratops can be distinguished from each other by the shape and size of the beak and the shape and size of the nose horn. Triceratops horridus has a small nose horn and a long beak, whereas, the second species in the genus Triceratops prorsus has a longer nose horn and a shorter beak. Triceratops horridus fossils were confined to the older strata, the lower portions of the Hell Creek Formation, whilst fossils of T. prorsus were found in younger rocks at the top of the Hell Creek Formation. Skulls found in the middle portions of the Formation displayed characteristics of both Triceratops species.\nNew Study Plots the Evolution of the Triceratops Genus\nPicture Credit: Montana State University\nThe picture above shows that at rock layers dated to around 67.5 million years ago, fossils of Triceratops horridus with its large beak and short nose horn can be found.

The analysis of the X-ray diffraction patterns is aided by the computer modeling of the defects inside the crystals using an elastic model. The research is to provide more detailed understanding of the precipitate structures in the process of aging and the age hardening mechanism of the alloy. The diffraction profiles from samples aged for different times at 315°C are collected using a position sensitive proportional counter with eu 1(0:1 radiation. The hardness values of the samples are also measured. An elastic model for the coherent precipitates in anisotrpic matrix is developed according to Eshelby's treatment of transformed regions in an elastic continuum. The displacement fields generated by the precipitates in the surrounding matrix, obtained through the elastic model, are used to explain the (110) streaks near the Bragg reflection, and to calculate the powder diffraction patterns from the aged alloys. For the latter purpose, a general X-ray diffraction theory is developed, combining the work of Krivoglaz and Dederichs. The X-ray diffraction patterns are compared with existing TEM observations in the literature. The analysis of the diffraction patterns suggests that the precipitates in the early stage of aging (GP zones) can be the matrix constrained version of 7, the equilibrium phase, similar to an observation by Khatchaturyan and Laughlin on 7 and 7'. The quantitative calculation based on this model shows excellent agreement with experimental data for samples aged at 315°C.

According to these reports, the T-Rex was the strongest dinosaur encountered.

Scientists concur that the creature was one of the largest terrestrial carnivores that ever lived, though many believe that the creature was a scavenger rather than a predator. The Rex's jaws were extremely large and filled with teeth over half a foot in length, and it's head and neck muscles had to have been very strong to support it. The creature's legs were similarly muscular and massive. Interestingly, the Rex's forelimbs were very small, almost comically undersized compared to the massive body.\nT-Rex's occasionally appeared in scattered and likely fraudulent front line reports by both GDI and Nod forces. According to reports, the Rex proved to be a grave threat against most tanks, even a Mammoth tank would not survive for long. It could crush soldiers under its gigantic feet, making it difficult to swarm one.\nIf protected by tanks, Rocket infantry could deal significant damage to a Tyrannosaurus Rex, however one must guard the Rocket infantry well, lest the other Dinosaurs rip him apart.

The main responsible PL for this are:\n- Phosphatidylinositol (PI) that promotes survival;\n- Phosphatidylcholine (PC) that promotes growth\nThese PL are important for the transport of TG from the intestinal mucosal cells into the lymph and thence into the serum as Chylomicra and Very Low Density Lipoproteins (VLDL).\nDietary PL (eg lecithin) also has an effect on lipid absorption.

These fishes are quite sensitive to poisoning by such treatments, and frequently are killed by the \"cure\".\nSome writers state good success using salt(s) (sodium chloride, artificial sea salt) prophylactically and for medicating; others, myself included, do not specifically advise salt use.\nAncient?

Simply buying a pair of rays and putting them together will not guarantee a successful pairing. The ideal way to obtain a pair is to buy a group of juveniles, housing them in a huge tank and allowing them to select their own partners.\nThe spawning act itself is quite brief, lasting only a few seconds. Fertilisation occurs internally, the male inserting one of his claspers into the cloaca of the female before releasing his milt. Following a successful mating event the male should stop harassing his partner.\nIn captive rays generally takes between 9-12 weeks. During the latter stages the developing young can sometimes be seen as a visible lump rising from the posterior end of the female’s back, although in well-fed specimens this can be tricky to spot. It’s essential to feed the female in sufficient quantities during this period as she will expend a lot of energy providing for her pups, and her appetite will increase significantly.\nThe pups usually have a small yolk sac attached at birth, and they will feed from this for anything up to a week. After the sac has been absorbed they should be offered high quality live and frozen foods several times a day.\nAdditional Information: Leopoldi Stingray is arguably one of the most stunning freshwater species in the hobby and comes with a price tag to match.\nAlong with sawfish and sharks all rays they have no bones in their body, with the skeletal structures being composed primarily of cartilage.\nThese fish are dangerous. Most natives of the countries in which they’re found are far more fearful of rays than other supposedly life-threatening species, such as piranha.\nThe actual stinging apparatus or spine is formed from dentin and possesses associated venom glands.", "score": 0.837693632, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:30cba350-5736-4223-b4fd-00fee545dcaf>", "text": "The flattened bodies of stingrays allow them to effectively conceal themselves in their environment. Stingrays do this by agitating the sand and hiding beneath it. Because their eyes are on top of their bodies and their mouths on the undersides, stingrays cannot see their prey; instead, they use smell and electro-receptors similar to those of sharks.\nFeeding Habits-Stingrays feed primarily on mollusks, crustaceans, and occasionally on small fish. Some stingrays’ mouths contain two powerful, shell-crushing plates, while other species only have sucking mouthparts. Stingrays settle on the bottom while feeding, often leaving only their eyes and tail visible.\nReproduction- When a male is courting a female, he will follow her closely, biting at her pectoral disc. He then places one of his two claspers into her valve. Stingrays are ovoviviparous, bearing live young in \"litters\" of five to 13. The female holds the embryos in the womb without a placenta. Instead, the embryos absorb nutrients from a yolk sac, and after the sac is depleted, the mother provides uterine \"milk\".\nAt the Sea Life Aquarium, two female stingrays delivered seven baby stingrays, although the mothers have not been near a male for two years. \"Rays have been known to store sperm and not give birth until they decide the timing is right\".\nStingray injuries- Stingrays do not aggressively attack humans, though stings do normally occur if a ray is accidentally stepped on. To avoid stepping on a stingray in shallow water, the water should be waded through with a shuffle. Contact with the stinger causes local trauma (from the cut itself), pain, swelling, muscle cramps from the venom, and later may result in infection from bacteria. The injury is very painful, but seldom life-threatening unless the stinger pierces a vital area. The barb usually breaks off in the wound, and surgery may be required to remove the barb and fragments.\nThe best treatment for a MINOR stingray sting is to immerse the effected area in HOT water (as hot as you can stand it) and it will ease the pain almost immediately.

Since so few young are produced, it is important that they survive. Thus, extended nurturing inside the mother’s body produces large young able to feed and fend for themselves, with no reported evidence of post-birth parental investment. Some stingaree species have a gestation period of around three months, which usually occurs at some point across spring, summer and autumn.

After mating, the female cherry shrimp attaches the eggs to her swimmerets until they hatch.\nThis process usually takes around three to four weeks. Once the eggs hatch, the newborn shrimp are tiny replicas of their parents and are fully capable of fending for themselves.\nHowever, they stay close to their mother for some time, benefiting from her presence and protection. As they grow, the baby shrimp molt several times to accommodate their increasing size.\nTo ensure proper cherry shrimp care, the aquarium shrimp needs to have plenty of hiding spots, plants, and moss for the newborn shrimp to take refuge in.\nAdditionally, it is essential to provide a well-balanced diet for the small shrimp, including specialized shrimp food or algae. With proper care and a suitable environment, cherry shrimp can successfully breed red cherry shrimp and care for their babies in an aquarium.\nPregnant Cherry Shrimp Stages\nCherry shrimp, scientifically known as Neocaridina heteropoda var. red, are a popular freshwater shrimp species in the aquarium hobby. If you’re interested in cherry shrimp breeding, it’s important to understand the various stages involved in the pregnancy of female cherry shrimp. Here’s a breakdown of the key stages:\n- Saddle Formation: Female cherry shrimp exhibit a saddle-shaped structure called a “saddle” on their backs, resulting from eggs developing within their ovaries. This is a visible sign that the female shrimp is preparing for reproduction.\n- Mating: In the next stage, the female shrimp will be receptive to mating. Male shrimp will approach the female and transfer sperm to fertilize the eggs inside her. Successful mating will lead to the fertilization of the eggs.\n- Egg Development: After successful fertilization, the female cherry shrimp will carry the fertilized eggs with her until they hatch. The eggs will be visible beneath her abdomen, appearing as small clusters or berries.\n- Hiding and Protection: The female shrimp will become more protective and cautious as the eggs develop. She may retreat to hiding spots within the aquarium, such as plants, decorations, or crevices, to safeguard the developing eggs from potential predators.", "score": 0.833660245, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:c1040c05-518c-45e0-bd11-fd52c8306de5>", "text": "Are Snails Born With Shells?\nSnails can be objects of fascination for kids playing outside. Lucky for the snails, they have their hard shells to protect them from children and predators alike. But are they born with that natural armor, or do they have to find it or grow it for themselves?\nSnails are, in fact, born with shells, but they don’t initially look like how you might imagine them. Snails are hatched from eggs that are buried beneath the surface layer of the soil or, in the case of marine snails, placed in a protected area, like near a rock. It usually takes two to four weeks for the eggs to hatch and for the baby snails to emerge, shells and all.\nThe shell of a baby snail, often referred to as a protoconch or “earliest shell,” is colorless and very soft. Due to the fragile state of its shell, a newly-hatched snail needs to consume a lot of calcium, which will help its shell to harden. A baby snail usually begins its calcium-rich diet by eating the shell of the egg it hatched from, a convenient source of nutrients.\nAs the snail continues to grow, its shell grows with it. The snail produces new shell material, like the soft material of its protoconch, that expands its shell and then hardens. The part of the shell it was born with ends up in the center of the spiral when the snail and its shell are fully grown. As a snail matures, the number of whorls or spirals which its shell has increases, as do the rings that grow inside the shell. Much like the way we think about tree rings, these rings inside a snail’s shell can be used to approximate the age of the snail.", "score": 0.833615839, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:a0d04e8a-84ab-4c04-968a-6e3cec175f78>", "text": "Solitary and nocturnal, the ocellated electric ray conceals itself during the day by lying partially buried in the sand, usually near a rocky reef (1).

By not developing an individual study, we analysed the oxidation that is generated as a measurable value in the medium in which the embryos are cultured. The more active and the better quality the embryos are, the more oxidation they cause within the culture medium. This indicates that they will be better prepared for being transferred and ensuring a higher success rate in the cycle for the patient. On the contrary, in the classification criteria, the level of oxidative stress decreased in line with a reduction in embryo quality.”\nThe study presented, which was also carried out at IVI Valencia, analysed a sample of 683 embryos from a total of 174 cycles that were performed by means of In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF), between May 2017 and December 2018.\n49 communications accepted: 14 oral, 31 posters and 4 invited sessions\nESHRE is the top European conference on Assisted Reproduction.

These became the Mashantucket Pequots who now own the casino in Ledyard.\nAs a result of the Pequot war of 1637 the remains of the tribe were split up. Their numbers were so diminished and scattered that they could hardly be called a tribe. They were not allowed to call themselves Pequots and their choice was to be sold as slaves or join the winners. Mohegans, whose blood is from the same stock as Pequots, were the natural recipient of captured Pequots. They were friends of the English and helped the settlers in every way. Mohegans were the settlers' closest allies. Therefore we did nothing to stop their growing power.\nUncas and the Mohegans suddenly became the most dominant tribe in southern New England, displacing the Narragansetts. Because the Mohegans allied themselves with the White settlers in Connecticut and Massachusetts, there was nothing to stop them, and they began seizing territory and exacting tribute from the smaller Mattabesic and Nipmuc tribes in the area. Rather than stop this, the English looked the other way. However, the Narragansetts grew increasingly alarmed at the growing power of Uncas and in 1640 formed an alliance with the Pocumtuc and Tunxis (Mattabesic) tribes against Mohegans. Sensing that the Narragansetts were on the verge of starting a war, the Boston Puritans forced them to sign a treaty promising not to go to war with the Mohegans without consulting them beforehand.\nDespite this agreement, Miontonimo continued his efforts to recruit more allies to fight the Mohegans.

As a result the Mohawks sent relentless raids down the river against the Susquehannocks and eventually reduced their numbers to about 550 by 1648. Eventually they were centered in the town of Conestoga and became known as the Conestogas.\nFinally in 1675 the Iroquois overwhelmed the Conestogas and took over occupation of their village. The remaining Conestogas were enslaved and taken to live with the Oneidas (another member of the Iroquois Confederacy) until they lost their language. Some years later the few remaining Conestogas were allowed to return to their ancient village of Conestoga where they lived a peaceful life among the white settlers of the area.\nThe final massacre of the Conestogas\nTo get a sense of how and why the peaceful Conestogas were eventually brutally slaughtered by white settlers it is important to picture what was happening up and down the American Colonies in the 1700s. In the largely lawless lands just a few hundred miles to the west of the Atlantic seaboard hoards of European settlers were grabbing land wherever they could find it.\nIn many cases local Indians had signed treaties with the white governments in exchange for relocating from the seaboard areas to territory further inland. But towards the end of the 1600s and in the first decades of the 1700s a new breed of immigrant started arriving from Europe – mostly Scots and Irish who were dispossessed of their land through brutal suppression by absentee English landlords.\nThis was a belligerent and independent minded group who had little respect for English law. When they came to America they often had no taste for life in the new English towns near the coast. Instead they headed for the uncharted lands that had only a decade or two earlier been given by treaty to native tribes.\nThe result was an inevitable clash between the new settlers and the natives.

The forces of liberalism and democracy emerged slowly, encouraged by the entrepreneurship of the business community, and the new religious freedom stimulated by the First Great Awakening.\nWith the establishment of Yale College in 1701, Connecticut had an important institution to educate clergy and civil leaders. Just as Yale dominated Connecticut''s intellectual life, the Congregational church dominated religious life in the colony, and by extension, town affairs in many parts.\nThe western boundaries of Connecticut have been subject to change over time.

To experience the colonial face of Connecticut, you need to venture inland to its tiny historic towns or cruise along the coast to see how little things have changed since the 18th century.\nConnecticut was one of the 13 original American colonies and established self-governance in 1637. The first English settlers moved inland from the Bay Colony and Plymouth Colony in Massachusetts, founding the towns of Windsor (1633), Wethersfield (1634), and Hartford (1636).\nThe Pequot War was the first major conflict between the Native American tribes and the Europeans. Bouts of smallpox brought on by the Europeans and pressures of regional trading led the Pequot tribe to attack Wethersfield. In retaliation, the English colonists slaughtered the entire tribe and began to expand their settlements further along the fertile river valley.\nIn 1662, the Connecticut Colony gained a royal charter from England.

FALL 2013\nThe arrival of Dutch traders in Connecticut in the early 17th century is the beginning of Connecticut’s immigrant story. The impact of Europeans on the well established Native American society was complex and within 25 years led to the devastating Pequot War.\nDuring the early 17th century, approximately 8,000 Pequot lived within a 250-square-mile territory in southeastern Connecticut defined by the present towns of Groton, Ledyard, Stonington, and North Stonington and the southern portions of Preston and Griswold. In the early 1630s an epidemic of smallpox, introduced by Europeans, swept through northeastern North America, decimating Native populations. It reduced the Pequot population to 4,000 by the eve of the Pequot War in 1635.\nBy the 1630s, the Pequot exerted control across southern New England by subjugating dozens of Native tribes and communities through warfare, coercion, diplomacy, and marriage, forming a regional confederacy of allied and subjugated tribes. Pequot influence extended along coastal Long Island Sound from Fairfield, Connecticut to Charlestown, Rhode Island and eastern Long Island, and up the Connecticut River Valley to the present border with Massachusetts, and included all of eastern Connecticut. Subjugation of these areas was critical to establishing and maintaining control of the fur and wampum trade and the flow of European goods to Native allies.\nThe Pequot’s efforts to control territory outside their homeland reflects a high degree of socio-political and military organization. These developments correlate with the arrival of Europeans and are a clear departure from earlier patterns of intertribal warfare. The change does not reflect the European introduction of firearms or European concepts of warfare but rather the shifting cultural objectives for which Native peoples waged war.\nDuring the period of Dutch dominance of the fur and wampum trade between 1611 and 1633, there was a time of relative calm in the Connecticut Valley as both the Dutch and Pequot benefited from their exclusive trading relationship and control of their respective economic and political spheres. The arrival of English traders in the Connecticut River Valley in the fall of 1633 sowed the seeds of the Pequot War.", "score": 0.820064783, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:0798082c-4636-464f-9b0c-acae467cb0de>", "text": "Saber Tooth Tigers roamed the land with the mega Lions, Mastodons, Mammoths, Buffalo, Eagles, Bears, Whales, Seal Lions, and many more animals that were very incredibly large.

For over 20,000 years the Chumash and other California Native Americans lived in peace and gave ceremony to the Great Mystery.\nCulture and History | Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe\nThe Mohawk are traditionally the keepers of the Eastern Door of the Iroquois Confederacy, also known as the Six Nations Confederacy or the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. Our original homeland is the north eastern region of New York State extending into southern Canada and Vermont. Prior to contact with Europeans the Mohawk settlements populated the Mohawk Valley of New York State. Through the centuries Mohawk influence extended far beyond their territory and was felt by the Dutch who settled on the Hudson River and in Manhattan. The Mohawks’ location as the Iroquois nation closest to Albany and Montreal, and the fur traders there, gave them considerable influence among the other Tribes. This location has also contributed directly to a long and beautifully complicated history.\nIn the 1750s, to relieve crowding at Kahnawake and to move closer to the Iroquois homeland, the French Jesuits established a mission at the present site on the St. Regis River. The Mohawk people had continually used this site at the confluence of the St. Lawrence River Valley as part of our fishing and hunting grounds prior to the building of the first church. “Akwesasne” as it is known today, translates roughly to “Land where the partridge drums” has always been a prime location due to the confluence of several small rivers and the St. Lawrence River. The Catholic Church records date back to the late 1600’s. Oral history states the church was built on traditional ceremonial grounds.\nThe community became more populated as Mohawks left the Mohawk Valley under distressed conditions in the mid 1700’s.", "score": 0.819559276, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:519060a8-832f-4288-a2dc-a7b0499342ce>", "text": "When the Pilgrims invaded in 1620, they “settled” where Squanto’s tribe had lived. The Wampanoags were rivals of the neighboring Narragansett tribe. When the Pilgrims arrived, the regional balance of power had been drastically altered, since the Narragansetts had not suffered a European-introduced plague quite yet, were trading with the Dutch, and Massasoit (the Wampanoags’ chief) saw a potential beneficial alliance for the remnant of his tribe.\nFor ten years, the settlers (about 300 of them) and Wampanoags lived in peace. When word got out about the paradisiacal life of the settlers and their benefactors, Puritans began coming by the boatload. The original Pilgrims, to their credit, respected their benefactor, and in later years as the new settlers took more and more land that was the Wampanoags’, the original Pilgrims protested that violation of their relationship with Massasoit. Those protesting Pilgrims soon found themselves expelled from their church.\nAlthough the Pilgrims got along with the Wampanoags, by instigation of Massasoit, Miles Standish and friends murdered a number of chiefs of the neighboring Massachusetts tribe. Around New England, the natives were finding out about European benevolence. In 1641, the Dutch governor of Manhattan offered the first scalp bounty.\nEventually, Thanksgiving took on a more macabre meaning. White invaders would have a Thanksgiving celebration each time they wiped out a native tribe. Europeans introduced a new tactic to the annals of invasion. They would surround a village at night, burn it, and kill every man, woman, and child in it. At other times, the women and children of a working age (generally over 14) would be sold into slavery and the rest slaughtered. An early and notorious instance of that tactic was the burning of the fortified Pequot village on the Mystic River in 1637, by English soldiers and their Narragansett and Mohegan native allies. They surprised the sleeping village of several hundred, burned the village to the ground, and killed fleeing natives. Neither women nor children were spared in the massacre.

There were two clans in Derby: the one at Paugusset, about four miles below the mouth of the Naugatuck River, erected a strong fort. At Milford and Stratford the Indians were numerous. There were several tribes in Stamford, and two small clans in Norwalk. The neighborhood about Woodbury was a favorite resort of several tribes. The number of Indians in Connecticut at the time of its settlement, was probably about sixteen thousand.|\n|↑2||River Indians. They were small bands scattered at different points along the river. They suffered from the attacks of the Mohawks from the West, and the Pequots from the East. For this reason they were anxious to have the English come into the valley. They sent some of their number all of the way to Boston to ask for help against the Pequots, and promised to give the English land if they would come and live among them. This visit called the attention of the colonists for the first time to Connecticut.|\n|↑3||The Indians in the western part of the State were tributary to the Mohawks.

On May 1, 1637 the first Connecticut General Court convened to discuss the Pequots. An army was gathered which consisted of only 90 able men. Of these, 77 went to the battle. The rest were left to guard the three towns. The Indians gathered 70 more. Some of those were even Mohawk mercenaries who did not like the Pequots and would fight for Uncas, the Mohegan, But they were still hopelessly outnumbered by 800 Pequots. Captain John Mason and Uncas stopped at Fort Saybrook to add about 50 soldiers. Proceeding along the coast they found all the Pequots waiting for them at Mystic, so they prudently continued toward Narragansett (Rhode Island). There they gained 200 Narragansett Warriors which doubled their ranks to 400 men.\nWhile marching overland to the Pequot territory the Narragansetts couldn't believe the noisy way soldiers move through the woods. They almost gave up and left but Uncas compelled them to stay and help fight the Pequots. When they got to the Pequot fort they found the Pequot Warriors out on a raiding party. So they trapped about 700 inside and burned the fort, killing all who came out. It was a massacre of mostly women and children. When that was done they ran to their boats at a rendezvous on the Thames River just barely ahead of 300 of Sessacus's warriors. They made it to the boats and had only 2 casualties and 20 wounded. Then in June 1637, Sessacus took the remainder of his tribe (about 400) and went west to find sanctuary among another tribe. He was chased by Thomas Stoughton with 120 men, John Mason with 40 men, and Uncas and his 70 Warriors. The Pequots were caught at a Poquonock Fort in Fairfield, and all but 80 were killed or captured. Sessacus and his 80 people ended up at Mohawk village where Sessacus was beheaded by Mohawk.

Native Americans fought on both sides of the conflict over Western US Territories; the greater number of tribes, unwilling to be subjugated, fought with the French, while fewer tribes fought with the British to prove assimilation and loyalty in support of treaties, many of which were later dishonored.

The first objective is on assessing the multicyclic behavior of limestone under continuous dual fluidized bed (DFB) operation. Different carbonation conditions were employed to derive a mathematical expression that is valid to compare the results from DFB and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) with adequate accuracy. A preliminary screening of three morphologically distinct limestones was conducted by TGA including exposure to SO2 and H2O during carbonation. The second objective is to analyze the influence of multiple process variables (i.e., temperature, CO2 loading, and H2O concentration) on the performance of the 20 kWth CaL facility’s bubbling fluidized bed carbonator. Within the investigated range of operating conditions, the chosen carbonator design allowed for CO2 capture efficiencies as high as 0.99 mol/mol, yielding an apparent carbonation rate (kSφ) of 0.09 s–1. Paving the way to a more flexible usage of CaL systems, the proposed carbonator design could be integrated into the existing load-following power plants, in preference to a conventional circulating fluidized bed carbonator that is heavily penalized when forced to operate under low capacity factors.\nCitationMoreno, J., Homsy, S.

When used properly, this method provides a very precise means of maintaining calcium levels within a system. Other than some adjustments, calcium reactors offer very few problems.\nThese reactors, such as the\nCA+ Calcium Reactor, produce a calcium solution by dissolving a calcareous media (e.g.,\nAragonite Reactor Media) in low pH water. The low pH is achieved by introducing\ncarbon dioxide into the reaction chamber. The rate of calcium supplementation is determined by the flow rate through the reactor chamber and the amount of the carbon dioxide dissolving the calcareous media.\n- Automated calcium supplementation - When set up properly and used correctly, a calcium reactor can maintain or increase calcium levels with little maintenance.\n- Great for large reef setups with high calcium demands.\n- Low long-term maintenance cost - After purchasing and setting up a unit, the only items that need to be replenished are carbon dioxide and calcareous media.\n- Straightforward set up and maintenance.\nCaveat - Calcium reactors, however, are not without some drawbacks.\nAs long as certain precautions are taken and conditions are properly maintained, there is little problem in running a calcium reactor. Before turning on the reactor, the calcium and alkalinity levels should be tested and noted so that a baseline or reference point has been established. These levels will then be used to determine if the reactor is working at an optimum level.\n- High initial set up cost - These units are relatively expensive and in addition to the reactor itself, a proper setup will also require a\ncarbon dioxide tank, CO2 regulator, needle valve and a pH controller.\n- Flow rate and carbon dioxide levels need to be manually set and adjusted at appropriate levels to facilitate proper calcium supplementation.\nAs with any type of calcium supplementation, levels for calcium and alkalinity should be tested and monitored closely to make sure everything is working properly. To get the most out of your calcium reactor, the following aspects should be considered; proper\nmedia, size, flow rate, carbon dioxide level,\npH level, regular\ntesting, and long-term maintenance.\n- Media Selection - Some media may contain a lot of phosphate resulting in the release of phosphate as the media dissolves.

The top has to be secured down to avoid leaks once the reactor is filled with water and starts recirculating. The one pictured accomplishes this with a large orange O-ring and thumb screws around the entire circumference of the top plate.\nThe most commonly used media is aragonite, a great source for calcium carbonate. There is some debate about the ideal size of the media. Smaller media has more surface area; however it is more likely to clog as it begins to dissolve into sludge. Larger media has less surface area but retains spaces for water and CO2 to flow through long into operation, making it less likely to clog. I personally like to use media that is on the coarse side, because it allows for less-frequent maintenance and the loss of surface area can be made up using a larger reactor.\nTwo Pumps Required for Operation\nA calcium reactor requires two pumps: a feed pump and a recirculating pump. A feed pump sends water to the reactor and maintains positive pressure in the unit. It is important to get one strong enough to force water into the reactor while under a little bit of back pressure because as the media dissolves, it turns a little slushy, and also the output of the reactor is going to be stopped down to a controlled drip.\nThe pump that does all the heavy lifting is the recirculating pump. This particular reactor takes water from the top of the unit and sends it to the bottom of the reactor. The CO2 gets chopped up and diffuses back through the media in a constant loop.\nThe water leaves the reactor and heads back into the system through the effluent line. It is a little counter-intuitive to send low pH water back into the system, but this actually helps boost the pH in the aquarium and add buffering stability. When the reactors here are running well, our pH is a rock-solid 8.3, and the tanks have steady levels of both calcium and alkalinity.\nCarbon Dioxide System\nThe CO2 portion of the system requires a tank and regulator, as well as a needle valve to control the flow of gas to the calcium reactor. It is a hidden cost to the reactor. Often aquarists price out a calcium reactor but fail to account for the CO2 portion.", "score": 0.846536577, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:37f725df-3266-4aba-9d2e-8b4286759a8e>", "text": "This paper presents a calculation model of the carbonator , the key reactor of the Ca-looping process, where COis captured as a result of .

Foam Fractionation is the term used for Protein Skimming, the two are interchangeable terms, using a device that creates very fine bubbles that express as foam and the organic impurities get attached to it. Then the foam is removed from the device to a collection cup that is later thrown away. This device is of utmost importance and thorough study in how it operates is recommended.

If yo live in an area where the room is cool enough, you r lighting may be sufficient in keeping things at the right temperature, however, if not, you need to keep the temperature low enough to keep things from heating up in your tank. Some lighting can be too much and heat things up. The best target for temperature should be about 77 degrees Fahrenheit, or 25 Celsius.

This helps to maintain pH and alkalinity as well as add important inorganic calcium to the tank.

It was not commercially successful.\nThe first large scale commercial implementation, in the early 1940s, was the fluid catalytic cracking (FCC) process, which converted heavier petroleum cuts into gasoline. Carbon-rich \"coke\" deposits on the catalyst particles and deactivates the catalyst in less than 1 second. The fluidized catalyst particles are shuttled between the fluidized bed reactor and a fluidized bed burner where the coke deposits are burned off, generating heat for the endothermic cracking reaction.\nIn the 1960s, several fluidized bed processes dramatically reduced the cost of some important monomers. Examples are the Sohio process for acrylonitrile and the oxychlorination process for vinyl chloride. These chemical reactions are highly exothermic and fluidization ensures a uniform temperature, minimizing unwanted side reactions, and efficient heat transfer to cooling tubes, ensuring a high productivity.\nIn the late 1970s, a fluidized bed process for the synthesis of polyethylene dramatically reduced the cost of this important polymer, making its use economical in many new applications. The polymerization reaction generates heat and the intense mixing associated with fluidization prevents hot spots where the polyethylene particles would melt. A similar process is used for the synthesis of polypropylene.\nCurrently, most of the processes that are being developed for the industrial production of carbon nanotubes use a fluidized bed. Arkema uses a fluidized bed to produce 400 tonnes/year of multiwall carbon nanotubes.\nA new potential application of fluidization technology is chemical looping combustion, which has not yet been commercialized.

I also looked at cheaper\nalternatives such as BKprecision, Instek, etc, but it looked like I\nwouldn't be able to get any reasonable dual channel supply for anywhere\nnear $200. I also browsed Ebay, but the heavy nature of power supplies\nmean that shipping would be a significant cost of any supply.\nEventually I looked on Amazon.com and I found a bunch of\nof supplies for reasonable prices and free shipping!\nTekpower TP3005D-3, Mastech HY3005F-3 and Dr. Meter HY3005F-3 Power\nSupplies (images from amazon.com).\nThey were all selling for between $180 to $190, and were\nthe three main 3-channel power supplies on Amazon. I knew I could get\nthe half sized single channel supplies for about $100, but I knew I\nwanted at least two channels, so these three look like they would fit\nthe bill. I also knew that I should revise my expectations given that\nthese are certainly very similar cheap-chinese PSUs, and therefore I\nwasn't expecting much from them in terms of performance and precision,\nbut that is ok for my purpose. If you are working with more sensitive\nlow-power circuits, the Rigols look like the way to go.", "score": 0.820036173, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:5552c37d-a3b0-4ca4-93ee-7069d588e77a>", "text": "Rigel Systems has introduced a new high-torque stepper motor kit for the William Optics Star 71 telescope, driven by a nFOCUS motor controller.\nRigel’s stepper motor has 0.1-degree step size and easily lifts 8.0 pounds (3.6 kilograms). The stepper can be quickly detached for manual focusing. The nFOCUS controller fits in the palm of your hand and provides two directions at two speeds – with only two buttons – using advanced logic control and voltage regulated output. nFOCUS provides an affordable way to achieve high-precision fine focusing without vibration, for visual and astro-imaging, and is easily switchable from motorized to manual focusing.\nLow speed is by adjustable pulse-width modulated (PWM) drive, providing full-voltage torque for reliable low speed operation. The length of the pulse of current to the motor can be adjusted shorter or longer, to produce from a 1-degree to 3-degree rotation of the focuser knob per step. nFOCUS also allows for the selection of the length of the pauses between pulses. With nFOCUS the focuser steps, then pauses, allowing the user to check the discrete changes in the focus before nFOCUS steps to the next focus position.\nSimply press the second button down while holding the first button down and the nFOCUS digital logic control switches to high speed drive, to get to focus quickly. The wide ranges of variability with the nFOCUS make it a snap to reach perfect focus.\nnFOCUS avoids the problems with some focus motor controllers which adjust voltage to adjust speed, and thereby don’t have the power needed to turn the motor over at low speed. The nFOCUS pushes the motor with a full 12-volt, short duration pulse to overcome stiction at low speed operation, providing plenty of power. The nFOCUS works to focus change step- by-step till it’s just right, eliminating coasting past then back past then past again. It uses three AA batteries (supplied) for long life.\nRigel Systems offers off-the-shelf stepper motor kits configured for Explore Scientific, GSO Classic, Tele Vue, Feather Touch, Celestron, UO Dual-Speed 2-inch/3-inch Focusers, and GSO LF 2-inch/3-inch Focusers.

The name Tautoru is applied to the same stars in the Cook Group.\nThe star Puanga is Rigel in Orion. A native authority has said: “The task of Puanga is to strive with Matariki (the Pleiades) that he may gain possession of the year.” This remark is illustrated by the fact that on the eastern coast of the North Island the commencement of the Maori year was marked by the heliacal rising of the Pleiades, but in other parts, notably the Ngapuhi district and the Chatham Islands, the year commenced with the cosmic rising of Rigel. The first new moon after such appearance of Rigel was the precise commencement of the year, according to another authority. Shand states that the three bright stars in Orion's Belt are called the whata, or food-store, of Puanga, by the Moriori. A Ngapuhi informant states page 39 that when Rigel appeared in the morning the village plaza was swept, referring to the function of welcoming its appearance. Rigel is said to be the parent of Aotahi (Canopus). When Rigel appears, we are told in Mr. White's notes (probably from a Ngapuhi source), offerings of tapu food are made to it, and certain charms or invocations are chanted to it.\nRigel is looked upon as one of the “food-bringers,” and also gives notice of approaching dawn: “The sun itself is pushing it from behind,” as an old native expressed it.\nAnother note reads: “The stars that are guides for the seasons are eternal, and are ever flashing in the heavens. Our forbears consulted those sign-giving stars in connection with the planting of the kumara crop. The principal stars so relied on were Rigel, the Pleiades, Orion's Belt (Tautoru), and Whakaahu.

To help with acquiring the necessary grip and traction, I have added two small handles to the tube spaced apart at about 120 degrees from the focusing mount.\nI have also added a small light-baffle to the top inside of the tube made from draft excluder self-adhesive foam tape.

If the temperature was any lower, then\nthe rate would decrease and if it were any higher, then the enzymes in the plant would denature so that the plant wouldn't be able to conduct photosynthesis any longer. This means that the hypothesis we made before the experiment was correct; if the temperature was low, then the rate of photosynthesis would be slower and if the temperature is at its optimum point, then the rate of photosynthesis will be at its fastest. Also if the temperature is at high, then the rate of photosynthesis can not be done again.\nWe later realized that the older spinach plant was more efficient than the fresher one which was bizarre.

Slide 14: At the temperature range below optimum, both photosynthesis and respiration decrease but rate of decrease is more for photosynthesis.\nSo, very little carbohydrate will be available for growth and development of the crop.\nFurther, the rate of protein synthesis in the development of new cells is also low. Hence, yield is reduced markedly.\nImmature foliage tissues of the vegetable crops are liable to freezing injury if they are grown persistently in very low night temperature condition. Slide 15: In the upper range of optimum night temperature, vigorous vegetative growth with high rate of photosynthesis and normal rate of respiration during daytime So, little carbohydrate is stored.\nOn the contrary, at lower range of night temperature, moderately vigorous vegetative growth is induced with consequent storing of more carbohydrate.\nThis situation is ideally conceived in potato, sweet potato and yam.\nSo, ideal crop growth and yield may be achieved if upper range of the optimum night temperature in the early vegetative phase and lower range of the optimum night temperature in the late vegetative phase (bulking phase) and reproductive phase of the crop are maintained.

It ranges from warm yellow lights at 2700K to cool white lights at 6500K and also includes green and purple in between. This can be seen on a blackbody graph for color temperature.\nThe color temperature of any light source can be measured with a chromometer. Incandescent grow lamps have a CRI of around 95 and emit reds and oranges in addition to yellow.\nHowever, it’s not nearly enough for plants to flourish when compared to fluorescent grow lamps that have CRIs from 70-90 and emit blue, green and purple as well as yellow.\nChlorophyll absorbs light from the blue part of the spectrum. So, it’s highly recommended to have a color temperature slightly higher than 2700K for your grow lamps to provide optimal growth.\nThis is much higher than CRI 95, even though that number seems relatively high. It has been shown that lights with a color temperature of 5000K and CRI 80 produce the highest growth rate in young Caesalpinia ferrea plants.\nDo not be fooled by the high lumen rating on incandescent grow lamps since this is only useful for measuring white light sources.

That is an understatement. Every practicing gardener knows that tomato plants love and depend on sunlight for their daily growth and ripening. What some gardeners never find out is that a lot of sunlight is actually dangerous to them, as is so little of it.\nThis brings us to the question. How much sun do tomato plants need? Does the amount vary during the day or do the plants require a certain standard temperature throughout for them to grow well and mature on time? Well, the answer is quite simple. For starters, we have to look at the whole growth process of a tomato plant and all its different phases.\nWhy Do Tomato Plants Need Sun In The First Place?\nTomatoes are a warm weather fruit with a soft outer coating that turns red when ripe and a juicy fleshing inside that is edible. A number of varieties such as the Early Girl, Matina, Stupice, Glacier etc are available today and can be divided into the quicker growing varieties and those that take longer to mature. Earl Girl and Glacier, for example, are quick growing varieties and take about 50 -75 days from pollination to ripening.\nAll plants need sunlight to meet certain requirements for different phases of their growth and tomatoes are no different. These requirements are always changing, mainly because of physical changes within and around the plant. Tomatoes need sunlight to manufacture food for growth.\nThe plant leaves absorb sunlight and use the green chlorophyll pigment in them to manufacture food for the plant in form of starch. This food is a source of energy for the whole plant, which in addition to the other nutrients from the roots, is a big requirement for everyday growth.\nEarly Growth/ Transplanting Phase\nDuring the early stages of growth, tomato plants are usually kept inside and grown in manageable places such as pots. After a few days, they are exposed to the sun for only a limited number of hours a day. When they finally grow up to 6 to 10 inches tall, they are then deemed fit for movement and transplanted to a garden.\nNewly planted tomatoes need all the sunlight they can get to develop. This is because its energy is required to support the plant’s huge growth needs such as growing roots and developing new leaves, which result from adapting to new soils.", "score": 0.84688437, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:dfede0e3-f798-46bd-bb1f-508396583cc3>", "text": "- Optimum temperature for photosynthesis in C3 is 15-25 ° C; 30-40 ° C in C4 plants and > 40°C in CAM\n- Carboxylating Enzyme is RuBP carboxylase in C3 plants, but in C4 plants it is PEP carboxylase (in mesophyll) and RuBP carboxylase (in bundle sheath) while in CAM it is PEP carboxylase (in the dark) and RuBP carboxylase (in light).\n- CO2: ATP: NADPH2 ratio 1:3:2 in C3, 1:5:2 in C4 and 1:6.5:2 in CAM.\n- The initial CO2 acceptor is Ribulose-1,5-biphophate(RuBP) in a C3 pathway and Phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) in C4 and CAM.\n- Kranz Anatomy is present in the C4 pathway only, and it is absent in C3 and CAM plants.\n- The CO2 compensation point (ppm) is 30-70 in C3 plant; 6-10 in C4 plants and 0-5 in the dark in CAM.\nWe all are aware of the fact that plants prepare their food, by the process of photosynthesis.

Despite a hagiographical tradition and historiography that has placed Catherine at a mystic remove from the politics of her day, Catherine's public authority was shaped by politics, both locally in Siena and broadly within late-fourteenth-century contests between the papacy and the Republic of Florence for hegemony in central Italy.\nIn The Saintly Politics of Catherine of Siena, F. Thomas Luongo combines literary-critical readings of Catherine's letters--she was the author of one of the largest collections of medieval letters--with political and social analysis. Drawing on a wide range of archival sources, Luongo investigates how Catherine's spiritual authority and sanctity were linked with contemporary political and cultural developments. He shows how the political situation of the church in Italy and a culture that privileged female spirituality and prophetic speech facilitated Catherine's emergence into a public role.\nThe Catherine who emerges from Luongo's well-written pages is a splendid example of what can result when a historian asks fresh questions about a familiar figure's life and brings new materials and methods to bear in formulating answers. The Saintly Politics of Catherine of Siena offers a woman more complex and interesting than the figure portrayed in most contemporary scholarship.\nAbout the Author\nF.

The key is to select a fluid that is not too light and also not too heavy.\nFluids thicken as their temperatures decrease and thin as their temperatures increase (like candle wax). The extent that they change is indicated by their viscosity index (VI). A viscosity index number indicates the degree of change in viscosity of an oil within a given temperature range, currently 40-100°C. Oil with a high viscosity index, say 160, would look and behave similarly at these two temperatures.

However, only plant derived compounds and their metabolites (terpenes, norisoprenoids and benzene compounds and their derivatives) must be employed to discriminate among floral origins of honey. Notwithstanding, many authors have reported different floral markers for honey of the same floral origin, consequently sensory analysis, in conjunction with analysis of VOCs could help to clear this ambiguity. Furthermore, VOCs influence honey’s aroma described as sweet, citrus, floral, almond, rancid, etc. Clearly, the contribution of a volatile compound to honey aroma is determined by its odor activity value. Elucidation of the aroma compounds along with floral origins of a particular honey can help to standardize its quality and avoid fraudulent labeling of the product.

However, for sugar, in the process of manufacturing, the organic acids, protein, nitrogen elements, enzymes and vitamins in the sugar cane are destroyed, whereas honey, a natural sweetener, subjects only to minimal heating. Also, honey has certain beneficial antioxidant and antimicrobial properties which are not present in table sugar.\nHere are three key points of comparing honey vs table sugar and they will make you feel good about eating honey:\n1. Lesser Amount is Required of Honey\nWhich has more calories? Honey or sugar?\nOne tablespoon of table sugar or sucrose contains 46 calories, while one tablespoon of natural sweetener honey has 64 calories. Though honey may have more calories, we actually need to use less of it since it is sweeter than table sugar. As a result, you may in fact consume even less amount of calories that you would with sugar. And in the long run even though honey is more expensive, it may be more economical than table sugar.

Honey is Slowly Absorbed into Bloodstream\nIs honey better than sugar in regulating blood sugar?\nTable sugar is sucrose, which is made up of two molecules bonded together. When we eat table sugar, our stomach has to use its own enzymes to separate the molecules apart before we can use the sugar’s energy. Honey is quite different. The bees have added a special enzyme to the nectar that divides the sucrose into glucose and fructose — two simple sugars for our bodies can absorb directly.\nHence, honey vs sugar, honey has a healthier Glycemic Index (GI) which measures the negative impact of a given food on the blood-glucose level. The lower the GI rating, the slower the absorption and infusion of sugars into the bloodstream and hence a more gradual and healthier digestion process (The Glycemic Index).", "score": 0.831631, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:469c7db3-6f68-468b-8db6-4a6b309d1838>", "text": "All honeys are sweet, due to the presence of the sugars fructose and glucose.

The waste left over once the gases and other products have been obtained is distilled once again at a higher temperature and in a vacuum.

Viscosity can be referred to as the measurement of a fluid’s resistance to flow. Viscosity can be viewed in two different ways. The first is a fluid’s tendency to flow as is visually indicated. One can think of this as the time it takes to watch a fluid pour out of a container. The term used to describe this is Kinematic Viscosity and it is expressed in units indicating flow volume over a period of time. The most commonly used unit of Kinematic Viscosity is the centistoke (cSt).\nThe Thick and Thin of Viscosity\nOf all the characteristics a lubricant may possess the most important is its viscosity. The viscosity of a fluid and how that fluid reacts to certain variables will determine how well the fluid can perform the basic functions of a lubricant.\nWhat is Viscosity?\nA fluid’s viscosity can also be indicated by measured resistance. You can think of this as the energy required to move an object through the fluid. It takes little energy to stir water with a spoon. However, significantly more energy is required to stir honey with that same spoon. The term used to describe this is Apparent Viscosity and it is expressed in units known as centipoise (cP). Other ways to refer to a fluid’s viscosity in more common generic terms are thin, light and low and suggest that the fluid flows readily such as water. Terms such as thick, heavy and high suggest the fluid demonstrates a strong resistance to flow in the example such as honey.\nViscosity is very important because it is directly related to a fluid’s load-carrying ability. The greater a fluid’s viscosity, the greater the loads that it can with stand. The viscosity of a fluid must be adequate enough to separate moving parts at operating temperatures of the equipment. Knowing that a fluid’s viscosity is directly related to its ability to carry a load, one would think that the more viscous a fluid is, the better it can lubricate and protect. The fact is, the use of a high viscosity fluid can be just as detrimental as using too light an oil.

Paleobathymetry determined from benthic foraminifera faunas from the subsurface of southeastern Lost Hills oil field shows water depth in the San Joaquin Basin >200 m in the latest Miocene, becoming progressively shallower to ~125 m by middle Pliocene, then (by middle Late Pliocene) to ~25 m, where it remained until the Pacific Ocean connection was tectonically closed at 2.2 Ma. I constructed a relative sea level curve for the late Neogene northwest San Joaquin Basin by assigning appropriate water depths to the succession of latest Miocene through latest Pliocene molluscan communities based on their similarity to published modern communities in San Francisco Bay, then smoothed it to remove most tectonic “noise.” When compared to the 3rd order Gulf of Mexico eustatic curve, this relative sealevel curve shows very close correlation. Using the relative sea level curve to refine stratigraphic timing, I developed a time-thickness diagram indicative of relative basin-margin subsidence. Latest Miocene basin-margin subsidence averaged ~25 cm/kyr, then accelerated to a peak of 140 cm/kyr in the middle Early Pliocene coincident with Coast Range uplift. By Late Pliocene subsidence slowed to 11 cm/kyr, then again peaked in latest Pliocene at 86 cm/kyr immediately preceding closure of the connection to the Pacific Ocean.", "score": 0.851815641, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:72ba8560-260a-45d7-a83e-8852b1f7f186>", "text": "The maps above show the San Joaquin basin during the middle Miocene (left) and the late Miocene (right) when the principle source rocks were deposited.

The story begins here with the Geologic History. Links to the other chapters of this story are on the menu to the left.\nThe San Joaquin Valley is a sediment-filled depression, called a basin, that is bound to the west by the California Coast Ranges, and to the east by the Sierra Nevadas. It is classified as a forearc basin, which basically means that it is a basin that formed in front of a mountain range.\nThe Valley dates back more than 65 million years ago to the Mesozoic, when subduction was taking place off the coast of California. However, the plate tectonic configuration of western North America changed during the Tertiary, and the ancient trench that once characterized offshore California was transformed into a zone of right-lateral strike-slip motion that we know today as the San Andreas fault. Nonetheless, the Valley still retains many features that characterized it prior to formation of the San Andreas transform.\nBecause the San Joaquin Valley is bound to the west by the California Coast Ranges, which represent a zone of folding and thrusting (i.e., an accretionary prism) associated with the ancient subduction zone, and bound to the east by the Sierra Nevadas, which represent the eroded roots of an ancient volcanic arc that was also associated with the subduction zone, some call the valley a remnant arc-trench gap.\nThe tectonic processes by which this arc-trench gap formed are complicated, as are the events by which the ancient trench became the San Andreas fault. These events are covered in more detail in the plate tectonics section of this website, and the four panels below show a snapshot of the key events.\nWhen the San Joaquin Valley first formed it was an inland sea between two mountain ranges. This configuration remained even after formation of the San Andreas fault (below). However, as the volcanic cover of the Sierras was eroded off, the resulting sediment was dumped into the Valley below. At the same time, The Coast Ranges were also being worn down and dumped into the valley. Thus, the inland sea was filled to create the continental basin we know today.", "score": 0.835194647, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:85f2ada6-7436-402e-b743-ce72400e8b46>", "text": "The south half of the Great Valley is called the\nSan Joaquin Valley and drains to the north, except the south end,\nparts of which have closed drainage; the north half is the Sacra-\nmento Valley and drains southward.\nThe Great Valley is a very large asymmetric syncline with 5\nto 10 km of uppermost Jurassic to Quaternary sedimentary\ndeposits along the structural axis defined by the configuration of\nolder basement rocks (Kilkenny, 1951; Ingersoll, 1978).

Underneath the San Mateo Creek valley's several hundred feet of alluvial deposits, there are layers of sandstone, limestone, siltstone, mudstone, shale and conglomerate. These formations are present along most of the streams draining off the west slope of the Santa Ana Mountains and are practically identical as far north as Santiago Creek, which is in north-central Orange County nearly 50 miles (80 km) away.\nThe alluvial deposits originate from the Wisconsinian glaciation, in which massive glaciers and ice sheets advanced over much of North America and shifted the global climate. During this roughly 60,000-year-long period that ended in approximately 8000 B.C., Southern California received up to 80 inches (2,000 mm) of rainfall per year, and this radical climate change coincided with a 300-to-400-foot (91 to 122 m) drop in sea level. As the sea levels fell, streams flowing into the Pacific from Southern California began to erode massive canyons in their floodplains.\nThe rivers eventually eroded to 400 feet (120 m) or so below their previous elevation. When the Wisconsinian period ended, sea level rose, filled these canyons and turned them into long, narrow inlets. Because the heavy rains ceased with the departure of the Wisconsinian, the rivers and streams once again became slow-flowing. Over the course of thousands of years, these calm inlets gradually filled with alluvial sediments, giving them the flat valley floors they have today. Over time, sea level dropped slightly again, allowing the rivers to once again entrench channels into their floodplains, resulting in the broad river terraces that line much of lower San Mateo Creek, Arroyo San Onofre and San Juan Creek.\nMost of the soils in the San Mateo Creek drainage area are loamy, well-drained and also fertile in the lowlands. In the mountains the soil cover is very shallow and there are many exposed cliffs, large boulders and outcroppings of sedimentary rock.

This increased pumping has caused additional land subsidence, as well as a shift in the part of the San Joaquin Valley most affected by the subsidence.\nThe subsidence rate doubled in 2008 in some areas around the Delta-Mendota Canal, the study found. Though much of the northern portion of the canal area was fairly stable, the southern portion experienced about 1.8 inches of subsidence from 2003 to 2008.

Both agricultural and municipal users are dependent on the Basin’s water supply. The Basin includes portions of Fresno, Kings and Tulare counties and large population centers such as Fresno and Clovis. Much of the region is developed for agriculture and a large variety of crops. Irrigated land covers close to 500,000 acres, and most crops need irrigation water during the dry season. Several water districts serve much of the land in the basin.\nThe Kings River is the Basin’s major source of surface water. The River, its tributaries, and sloughs are the lifeline of riverine-riparian habitat that links the Sierra Nevada Mountains to the foothills to the Valley floor. Pine Flat Reservoir, located in the nearby Sierra foothills, regulates the flow of the Kings River and provides storage, flood control, hydropower and recreational opportunities. The San Joaquin River also is an important source of surface water to the Basin. Entities with water entitlements from the Central Valley Project (CVP) Friant Division use the Friant-Kern Canal to send that water into the Basin.\nThe Basin features an extensive canal network measuring more than 1,000 miles. That system delivers water to farmland, groundwater recharge facilities and several surface water treatment facilities. The weirs, diversion structures, canals and recharge facilities are part of an interconnected physical and hydrologic system managed by a variety of local and regional water agencies.\nThese water agencies manage the available water supply through conjunctive use, which is the combined use of surface water and groundwater. Water demand exceeds the surface water supply, necessitating conjunctive use of surface and groundwater as a supply source.\nMany surveys and studies show that groundwater supplies are declining within the Kings Basin. This condition, considered generally as overdraft, is created when more water is pumped out of the ground than is replenished by rainfall, runoff or recharge.\nFactors that influence available groundwater supplies include wet or dry hydrology, the degree of groundwater pumping, and the availability of structures to hold excess water for recharge.

(An acre foot equals 325,900 gallons, or enough water to cover a football field to a depth of one foot.) The three general characteristics which contribute to the overdraft condition are considered to be: 1) groundwater pumping to meet agricultural water demand when surface water diversions are inadequate to fully meet the crop water requirements; 2) high reliance on groundwater for all demands in much of the western parts of the Kings Basin; and 3) urban development and reliance on groundwater once lands are converted to urban use from agricultural uses.\nMany communities and water agencies prepare groundwater management plans or cooperate in similar regional planning efforts. Those plans aim to maintain or improve the groundwater supply in a specific area, and may also be used to coordinate planning efforts within hydrologic regions.\nThe Kings Basin groundwater aquifer system is composed of well-defined layers that include sand, silt, clay, rock and gravel. Underground banks of water, or aquifers, are created when water collects in formations of porous material.\nThe Basin’s underground landscape has been shaped by centuries of glacial movement, periodic flooding, mountain erosion and more. The characteristics of an area dictate whether an aquifer is formed.\nSome deposits, or alluvium, are highly permeable and allow rainfall, runoff or other water to soak into the ground. More dense deposits of silt and clay limit the downward flow of water and create confined spaces for it to settle.\nOne of the most dominant features in the Kings Basin is Corcoran Clay, also called E-clay, which ranges to a depth of 550 feet. This thick clay layer acts as a barrier between underground aquifers, and occupies much of the western portion of the basin.\nAquifers exist in varying layers and depths throughout the basin. Throughout the region, groundwater generally flows to the southwest.\nA critical solution to groundwater overdraft is finding both land and available water to replenish the groundwater supply. Both the Kings and San Joaquin rivers connect to the Basin and serve as sources of recharge. However, additional replenishment through recharge projects is needed. Fortunately, it is possible to expand recharge programs within the Basin.\nSeveral factors help determine whether land is suitable for recharge.", "score": 5.402740387945352e-15, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:3fe84e2a-9888-46b2-9d8d-123709c7b6f6>", "text": "Whether you have been using a contract for years or if it is brand new for you, it won’t kill you to examine and perk up your music contracts.

There was a moment in time when it seemed like record labels would become obsolete but that day never arrived. They still have tremendous potential upside for an artist’s career provided that the deal that is struck is an equitable one. That said, these questions are often asked by aspiring artists who have yet to lay the groundwork to increase their odds of such a partnership. There are absolutely artists who get signed seemingly with very little work put in and without apparent reason but keep in mind that music is subjective. It’s also good to keep in mind that while it may seem that there was very little work put in there is often a great deal going on behind the scenes. Lightning does strike for certain people but it’s the exception to the rule. Here are some things to work on to increase your odds of getting a deal.\nBe Great at Your Craft and Be Patient\nIt’s such a stock answer and I feel lame mentioning it but it’s true. Practice (not only your voice and instrument but your writing) and don’t rush releasing or shopping product. Get feedback and wait until one of your most critical (and brutally honest) friends gives you the thumbs up. There is a general feeling out there that music is just an innate talent. While there is some truth to this, talent is also putting in a ton of work. Remember the world isn’t waiting on your first batch of songs. Take your time, get better at what you do and get your first release right.\nMake Sure Your Presentation is Professional\nIf you have to apologize for anything in your presentation don’t promote yourself or shop to labels just yet. You can’t say “I haven’t gotten around to it yet” or “I didn’t have the money to hire a professional to do x.” If you don’t present yourself as a professional who is committed to making a living at this neither industry nor consumers will take you seriously. Keep in mind that the production, mix and master of your songs should be of competitive quality. The same is true with your photos, artwork, social media presence and fan interaction of all kinds.\nCollaborate and Make Connections With Other Artists\nMusicians often overlook one of the most important connections within our industry- other musicians!", "score": 0.859225392, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:d2da6a37-ab63-49c7-aa51-042357cbaed9>", "text": "This may seem obvious, but artists often choose to enter into a contract purely because the other party has assured them it is “standard” and “very fair.” More often than not there are terms that are more favourable to the other party and may not protect the artist appropriately. You’re entitled to fully understand what you’re agreeing to so you can make an informed decision.\nIf you seek expert advice, make sure you use an appropriate source. Don’t get legal advice from your neighbour, an accountant or even a lawyer that doesn’t practice in entertainment. Music law is a very specialised field, it’s in your best interests to make sure your advisor knows the area well and appreciates the big and small fishhooks to look out for.\n3. Contracts 101: Start with the basics\nContracts are usually long and complicated. If you’re trying to get your head around a deal, a good starting point is to look at the basics. Obviously, you will also need to work through the finer details as well, but concentrating on a checklist of core questions as a first step can help kickstart discussions.\nAsking the questions below can be a good place to start:\n– What is the term of the contract? (i.e. how long are you locked into it for)\n– Are there any options to extend the contract? Who has the power to do this?\n– What territory does the contract cover? Just New Zealand and Australia? Europe? Worldwide?\n– Are there any warranties (i.e., promises to do certain things)? What are they? Are they realistic? What else does the contract obligate you to do?\n– Who can terminate the contract? For what reasons?\n– How is each party remunerated?\n4. Get something in return\nFinally – a good agreement should involve a fair exchange of obligations to the benefit of both parties. Be warned – you need to make sure the other party is clearly outlining what they are going to deliver by signing you on. If the other party doesn’t meet their obligations, the agreement should include an option for the artist to get out of the contract.\nA classic example of this going badly is a record deal where the artist has assigned the copyright on their masters over to a record company in exchange for the financing of an album, EP or single.\nIn this scenario, the muso no longer owns the music.

When that happens, it’s important to know what to ask for, how to structure the job so you’re not overworked, and how to deal with the logistics of payment.\nDue to the Internet and digital technology, the process of music production has become much more decentralized over the last couple of decades. Nowadays, most freelance studio-musician and engineering situations are freely negotiated by the parties involved. There are no longer pricing structures or work-rule standards to govern them. If you want it to work out favorably for you, it’s good to have some idea of what you want to charge (either on an hourly or per job basis), what the market will bear, and how to structure in some protections for yourself in the deal.\nI’ve had many situations where someone approached me about playing on a session, and asked me the question: What do you get? In those situations you have to make a calculation based on the circumstances of the offer. The first part of the equation is, what do you think is fair pay for your time and expertise? Next you have to look at who is making the offer, and factor that in when you state your rate. If it’s a struggling singer songwriter, you may want to quote a lower figure than if it’s, say, a well-off doctor who’s decided to record a vanity album.\nAnother factor to take into account is how badly do you want the gig? If you’re trying to get your feet wet with playing sessions or mixing, you may be willing to take a low figure just to get the experience under your belt. Hopefully, your client will like what you do and hire you for more work in the future, or recommend you to others. The bottom line: If the gig will help advance your career, take what you can get. If it’s simply a financial thing for you, don’t take less than you feel you're worth.\nTypically in these situations, the client will expect to pay you on a per-song or per-job basis, not by the hour.

If managed correctly, contracts can be a great mechanism to detail the work to be undertaken, the role of each party and the agreed price.\nHowever, when there is a variation to a contract, which is often oral in nature rather than written, disputes can arise. This can result is significant legal fees being incurred by both parties as they attempt to resolve the issue.\nBelow are our some helpful tips regarding what to include in a contract to prevent a dispute occurring and some of the legal considerations regarding the enforceability of contracts.\nTerms and conditions – what should I be including?\n- The terms and conditions of your business should essentially be a manual for how you do business. It should provide a course of action regarding what will happen in different situations, such as one party wanting to exit the agreement, or the scope of work being varied by either party. The specific components to include depends on the nature of your business.\n- Your business should have some key terms and conditions that can be expanded upon, and in the circumstances, have the ability to be varied on the spot.\nWhen is an agreement legally enforceable?\n- Irrespective of whether your contract is verbal or written, if you have agreed to provide a service or supply a good for consideration, you have entered into a contract.\n- Sometimes an oral contract takes place in order to get started as quickly as possible on the agreed work, however, it is much safer to have a written contract, rather than relying on your recollection of the oral conversation with the other party.\n- If you do form an oral contract, and either party suggests a variation to the contract, make sure you record the conversation, what was said and the outcome in a diary.\n- It is important to note that an agreement is not always legally enforceable. This is called an “Absence of consideration” and usually occurs when there is no provision for money being exchanged in the agreement.\nWhat happens if I don’t have a written contract?\nIf you do not have your agreement or contract in writing, you are exposing yourself and your business to a range of avoidable risks. These include:\n- the risk that you, or the party to whom you made the agreement or contract with, do not understand the scope of work to be undertaken and specific tasks to be completed.", "score": 0.856153369, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:4cbc041f-2ae5-4e55-8e6f-5c9a2ee8d803>", "text": "You want to make sure you get paid in case the relationship deteriorates.\nHow should one make changes to existing contracts?\nIf you made provisions for regular reviews, update your Terms and Conditions on paper or on your website and direct your client to those changes.

You learn six new songs requested by the person that hired you and are counting on the gig and the fee you will earn. Two days before the show, you get a text message saying that the gig is off because of a mix-up between the person throwing the party and the owner of the hall. What do you do?\nIf you had a written performance agreement signed and in place, you likely would be in a position to negotiate all or part of your band’s payment. Without any type of written music contract, the chance of your getting any money is minimal.\nTo learn more about performance contracts, we’ll check in with an expert on the subject, Michael A. Aczon, a veteran entertainment attorney and author of The Musician’s Legal Companion, a no-nonsense guide to navigating the business of music. In his more than 25 years as an entertainment attorney, he has advised a wide range of clients, helping them protect their interests.\nFirst, what are performance contracts? According to Michael, “These typically refer to any agreement that spells out the details of a live performance. They can range from oral agreements or simple one-page documents or email for one-time performances (often referred to as ‘casuals’), to elaborate touring agreements that are dozens of pages long.”\nAlthough many bands and musicians perform without them, usually without a problem, a gig agreement “serves as a roadmap and anticipates various issues that may arise between parties. It will address those issues before the performance, so everyone has a reference point if there are any problems along the way.”\nThere are four main components in a simple band contract. We’ll go over each of these four main areas.\n1) Scope of performance. Exactly what are the musicians being contracted to do? The agreement should clearly explain the pertinent details. For instance, how long will the performance last (time, number of sets, breaks allowed, etc.)? What group is contracted to perform (including how many musicians)? Are there additional performance requirements (play at the wedding ceremony and the reception; appear at a press conference and at the local radio station the week before the concert)?

You should always consult with a lawyer, but here are some things to be aware of…\n4 THOUGHTS FROM ME\n1. Most importantly, always feel free to ask the label for changes and clarifications. Each label has its own standard and changes in it hardly ever happen, but sometimes they do. If you don’t understand something, ask fellow producer friends or feel free to just email me, but it’s important to feel comfortable with what you’re signing.\n2. Read carefully if there is any exclusivity requirement in the contract. Some labels might ask you for ‘full exclusivity’ or a ‘first-option exclusivity’, which is really common. The first is when a label only wants you to sign with them and no one else, but it’s not a common requirement. The second is when a label wants to hear your demos first, and if rejected by them, you can send it elsewhere, which happens a lot. If you receive something like this, be careful since even though you can send your tracks to labels ‘after you get rejected’, getting constant rejections from a label can suck the fun out of it and your motivation as well. Also, it can affect your collab plans if the other collab partner has a similar contract with another label.\n3. Label promises can come true, but try to get them on paper as well. When a label offers you a contract and a lot of perks for the signing, make sure to get it all on paper or at least via email. Hardly ever a label will be able to promise you a ‘confirmed placing’ on a podcast, but if they say they can, it’s always better to have it on paper, so if it doesn’t happen, you can recall what is written. Remember that if it’s not written, they legally don’t have to do it and verbal promises can go down the drain.\n4. Try to get the biggest percentage you can for your song. Big labels will take a big chunk of your song (70-90%) and medium/smaller labels can take a bit less, but usually between 50-70% of your song. That’s because the maximum you can take as an artist is 50% of the royalties of that track.", "score": 0.852657855, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:e8a59db9-8c77-40cd-8f48-155a53aa5f11>", "text": "The management contract: Discussing the details of an artist-manager contract is beyond the scope of this article; so when it comes to signing, it is important that you have the contract drafted and/or negotiated by an experienced entertainment attorney who is well-versed in similar entertainment / management contracts.

It should also spell out how, if at all, you can get out of the deal if the manager is not performing as promised, and what the penalties for non-performance should be. You should also understand how and for what duration commissions are to be paid after the management contract has been terminated.

This is a crucial period, and a smooth exit strategy is essential in order for a songwriter to be able to retake control of his or her catalog, or to move on to a new deal with another company. If you’ve reached the end of the line with your current publisher, or if you’re in the midst of entering into a new relationship, here are four things to ask:\n1. How long can we go on like this?\nIn the world of publishing contracts, one “contract period” does not necessarily equal a year. A publishing deal with two option periods does not necessarily end at the end of the second option period. In this land of legalese, things are not always what they seem.\nSome contracts are actually built on periods that will last a calendar year. But most agreements today are built on a “contract period” that will last a minimum of one year, but could stretch into multiple years depending on whether or not a certain number of songs have been delivered, a certain number of exploitations have been obtained, or a certain level of recoupment has been reached (that is, the earning back of whatever was paid as an advance to the writer).\nI have seen instances where songwriters have spent five or six years in the first “contract period” of their deal, trying to hit a Minimum Delivery Requirement or Minimum Release Requirement that was completely beyond their reach. This can literally be a career-ending situation, as writers are forced to live year after year off that first period advance, with no hope of receiving another payment until they obtain a certain amount of placements.\n2. Whaddya want from me?\nSo let’s talk about that Minimum Delivery and Minimum Release requirement. These two clauses are at the heart of most “break-up” problems between writer & publisher. A Minimum Delivery Requirement is usually not a big threat– it’s a fairly standard clause that requires a songwriter to hand in certain amount of new songs (usually 8-12) per “contract period”.

It’s exciting, and no doubt the label or manager or producer on the other side are in a rush to get it done. You feel pressured to sign without properly checking it out – they seem trustworthy, it’s easier to assume everything will be ok and hope for the best, right?\nIt’s surprisingly common to see musos seriously damage their careers by entering relatively blindly into agreements. If you’re serious about your music, here’s four simple legal tips to help you toward safeguarding your creative capital and future earnings.\n1. Get it all down in writing\nHere’s the thing – contracts don’t have to be written down to be legally binding, but there’s a very good reason why they usually are. While it’s tempting to do a handshake deal and assume the other party has your back, both parties need to know where they stand to prevent ugly disputes down the track. You’d be surprised how many artists and music businesses do a bad job of this – with expensive and devastating consequences for the artist.\nDuring the negotiation phase, verbal promises not to enforce certain clauses may be made to you. This includes comments such as “don’t worry, we’d never implement this clause” and “just ignore that part.” If you hear this, alarm bells should ring.\nLegally, the contract you sign will take precedence over any other agreement. So don’t be afraid to stand your ground and get it in writing – any verbal or informal discussion to vary or add terms needs to be reflected in the final contract. This also means deleting any clauses that the parties agree are “non-applicable.”\n2. Don’t get ‘legal advice’ from the person you are signing with\nBeing a muso can be hard graft. “Safer” careers can mean a comparatively comfortable and more predictable lifestyle.

Some of the key provisions that should be included within a vendor agreement for services include: A Description of Services: First and foremost, a vendor services agreement should provide a clear overview of the nature and scope of the services that are to be offered under the contract. In some cases, a statement of work will be included with the agreement. The more detailed description of the services is, the better — as it is crucial that all parties understand their duties. The Terms for Payment: Certainly, an effective vendor services agreement should have a clear explanation of the terms for payment. Among other things, the contract should address how much will be paid, when it will be paid, and how it will be paid. Often, the vendor is paid partially upfront and partially upon completion of the agreement. Term of the Agreement: How long will the vendor services agreement last? Make sure that you clearly define the term of the relationship. Whether your company is hiring a vendor for a single event or to provide ongoing services, it is essential that the term of the contract is understood by all parties. Limitation of Liability: Many vendor services agreements contain a limited liability clause or an indemnification clause. If you are entering into a vendor services agreement in Central Florida, be sure to carefully review the liability provisions. A lawyer can help you understand if the limitations on liability are fair, reasonable, and in your best interests. Restrictive Covenants: Depending on the nature of your relationship with the vendor, you may be interested in seeking a restrictive covenant. A common example of this is a non-compete agreement. For a number of different reasons, you may not want to work with a vendor that provides similar services to direct competitors. Notably, under Florida law (Florida Statutes § 542.335), there are very strict regulations regarding restrictive covenants. In order to be legally enforceable, non-compete agreements must be carefully drafted. Confidentiality Clause: A confidentiality clause is a contract provision that requires parties to refrain from disclosing certain information. Often, vendors receive access to some sensitive internal information. With a non-disclosure provision, parties may be able to make sure that key information is kept strictly confidential. Renewal/Termination Clause: Finally, it is generally recommended that parties address issues of renewal and termination when negotiating a vendor services agreement.", "score": 0.19664563958879214, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:168978b0-fb79-45fa-a2ac-e89e100d6346>", "text": "How contractors should handle ongoing contracts\nYou can enter into ongoing contracts without fear of being caught.

However, there are no set rights available to employees or employers in the UK when negotiating contracts and indeed it is well known the verbal agreement can be contractually binding.\nIn 2008 in the case of Tullett Prebon Group Ltd v Ghaleb El-Hajjali15, an employer successfully enforced a clause in a contract which required the prospective employee to pay a specified amount if he did not start work – what is sometimes referred to as a \"no show\" clause. Such clauses are unusual, however, and in reality the risks of a no-show are relatively low. To the extent that a contract is agreed, and then one party does not then abide by the terms of that contract, then the \"damaged\" party may have cause to pursue claims for breach of contract.\nIn the UK, it should be noted that once an employment contract has been finalised, there are implied terms that apply to all employment contracts. Those implied terms include the mutual obligation of trust and confidence. The employer must not, without reasonable and proper cause, conduct itself in a manner which is likely to destroy or seriously damage the relationship of trust and confidence between that of the employer and employee. Should a promise be made by the employer to the executive, such as that of a bonus or promotion, failure to fulfil that offer may constitute a breach of the implied term, trust and confidence, and may also give rise to implications such as constructive dismissal and destroy the relationship between the parties altogether. This is obviously a significant factor to consider during all stages of negotiation – making promises which are not then kept can lead to legal battles, although there are often difficulties that arise regarding evidencing the terms of oral agreements.\nWhat can employers in the sports industry do to best manage scenarios such as this?\nEmployment contracts are personal and negotiations can be influenced by subtle nuances. From the outset, employers need to remember that when negotiating with senior executives and other employees, to avoid hidden restrictions or preconditions and consider whether the company is willing to share any risk (for example, will they agree to indemnify an individual to the extent they are subjected to legal proceedings as a result of their departure from their former place of work?).", "score": 0.013850139782344497, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:162b0704-55ff-4433-af31-0f8409277616>", "text": "Setting specific, realistic, and clear objectives and priorities will allow you to have a deeper understanding of what you actually want and help you explain it in such a way that the other party listens.\nAim for a Win-Win Outcome from The Start\nActing selfishly and manipulative only ends up harming both the parties involved. Striving for a win-win situation from the start creates an atmosphere of give-and-take and maximizes the chances of productive negotiation agreements for both parties.\nFocus on Long-term Relationships\nFocusing on temporary victories alone can harm you in the long run. The key to developing lasting relationships is negotiating a contract based on long-term relationships. It will ensure that both parties leave the table in a positive and satisfied mood.\nThese contract negotiation strategies are in no way exhaustive, but they are some of the time-tested methods that ensure a smooth and productive contract negotiation.\nNow, let’s take a look at why negotiation agreements are important.\nWhat Makes Contract Negotiation Important?\nA well-rounded contract negotiation process is vital for the following reasons.\n- Certainty: To achieve certainty regarding the terms and conditions across the board.\n- Clarity: To achieve clarity concerning the parties' points of view, goals, and priorities.\n- Mutual Benefit: To reach a deal that is a perfect balance of low risk and high benefit for both parties.\n- Achievement of Objectives: To reach a position where the objectives and goals of both the organizations/parties are met in an amicable and agreed-upon way.\n- Long-term Relationship: To achieve a long-term relationship with other parties that is helpful for increased growth and collaboration.\n- Avoiding Conflict: To avoid future conflict arising from undiscussed agendas, conditions, or objectives.\nWho Negotiates a Contract?\nGenerally, it is the legal counsel's job to review and negotiate contracts. However, HR managers, operations executives, sales managers, procurement managers, and financial leaders often negotiate contracts.\nContract negotiation is a prerequisite for reaching agreements that are useful, beneficial, and free of conflict.

Unceasing, limitless – a constant circle.\nWhat was the most difficult aspect of launching the label?\nTo be honest, the whole thing was much harder work than I ever realised, especially for one person.

But because of the wider concept of the brand and the visual elements, an artist has to bring more than just music.

Prior to 2001, Napster was a free download application where music MP3’s could be downloaded, uploaded, and traded free of charge. The idea behind it was that people had a right to share their music with others and Napster was simply providing a means of doing so.\nWhile Napster may have had good intentions, the website ended up costing the music industry millions in lost royalties because the recording studios and artists were not giving permission for their music to be distributed in this way. In response to the Napster developers’ actions, A&M Records, the nation’s largest recording company, filed a lawsuit to stop Napster from facilitating any further free music transmissions.\nNapster and Copyright Law\nThe federal copyright code details specific exclusive rights given to musicians for their works. Under Title 17 Section 106, these exclusive rights include the right to reproduce the copyrighted work in copies or phonorecords. It also includes the right to prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work and to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership, or by rental, lease, or lending.\nIn the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and motion pictures and other audiovisual works, the musician has the right to perform the copyrighted work publicly and in the case of literary, musical, dramatic, and choreographic works, pantomimes, and pictorial, graphic, or sculptural works, including the individual images of a motion picture or other audiovisual work, the artist has the right to display the copyrighted work publicly. In the case of sound recordings, the artist has the right to perform the copyrighted work publicly by means of a digital audio transmission.\nWhat Did Napster Do Wrong?\nThe problem was that Napster took advantage of right number three under copyright law.

Andy did almost everything by the book: Licensing the right to cover the songs from Miles Davis's publisher. He even gave the profits (including all the money generated by his ground-breaking Kickstarter campaign) to the five electronic musicians that participated.\nBut there was one thing that Andy overlooked - or never thought would be a problem - that has ended up costing him a lot of money and heartache: The artwork for Andy's \"Kind of Bloop\" was a digitized transformation of the original photo of Miles from the 1959 album (the digital image Andy created is on the Youtube video above) - and the copyright holder of the original photo (see below) claimed copyright infringement.\nA June 23, 2011 article in Gizmodo by Matt Honan recounts how the eccentric photographer of that original iconic photo, Jay Maisel, used the copyright law to get a significant amount of money out of Andy Baio. Andy eventually settled (claiming he was in the right, but couldn't afford the legal fees to prove it) - paying Maisel $32,000. This payment, plus another $10,000+ in costs to Andy's own lawyers put the price tag at close to $50K. This even though a great many lawyers think Andy had done nothing wrong.\nTo be fair, there are legal experts on Mr. Maisel's side too. For example Terry Hart has argued that the outrage over this case amounts to \"inexcusable... mobbing of a celebrated photographer.\" Hart's argument boils down to this: because \"Baio used Maisel’s photo from the cover of a Miles Davis album for the same purpose as the original — copying cover art to use as cover art\" the use is not entitled to the \"fair use' exception under copyright law.\nThis case highlights a big problem with our copyright law: Rich content owners can assert that they have rights - and bleed poor artists to death in legal costs - even when the poor artist is operating within (or very close to) the established law.", "score": 0.847626507, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:dcfb590e-6d90-4d01-9dae-bd7935e944ca>", "text": "There’s no easy answer, I know, which is why copyright law is so confoundedly tiresome (as is pretty much any legal undertaking), but I would love to know what you make of this and, since they doubtless exist, any other cases of classic crime fiction where these sorts of controversies rage.

If you write a song, you own the copyright to both the melody and the lyrics to that song. In the days before you could fix a song as a recording, there were two ways that composers generally made their money: 1) from selling sheet music and 2) from royalties earned from public performances of their songs. There wasn't a question of covers; there were simply different performances of musical pieces. Today, permissions and royalties for public performances of songs in the US are largely handled by the performing rights societies ASCAP, BMI, and SESAC. The societies collect public performance fees from broadcasters and venues and then compensate the rights holders.\nThen, a revolutionary piece of technology came along: the phonograph. Suddenly, a single performance of a song could be fixed in a (more) permanent state and distributed to thousands of people. This caused a bit of concern for music publishers. After all, it was the accepted nature of music that someone would hear a song and then want to perform that song themselves.", "score": 0.833242893, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:9e3e0c56-a6e8-4506-bfc7-a8108987cda2>", "text": "25 may. 2006\nI need your help.

I would also explain why the solutions, for the most part, do not require legislative reform.\nWhat is the problem with the Copyright Board?\nThe Copyright Board is possibly larger and better funded than any other tribunal of its kind in the world. It lacks resourcefulness not resources. Most of the problems with its procedures stem from the absence of a substantive theory of regulation. Let me explain.\nThe Board describes itself “as an economic regulatory body” or “an independent, quasi-judicial tribunal”, and it explains that its mandate is to set “fair and equitable royalties”. The Board can describe what it does, but it is not very capable of telling why it exists and what problems it is supposed to solve.\nMore specifically, the Board’s decisions do not convey a coherent view of why the royalties that it sets are indeed “fair” and “equitable” and how to distinguish them from royalties that would be “unfair” or “inequitable”.\nSimilarly, while it views itself as a regulator, the Board is sometimes confused about the identify of the regulatees: does the Board exist to regulate copyright collectives (because otherwise they would charge too much); or is its job to regulate users (because otherwise they would pay too little)?\nThese are fundamental questions.", "score": 0.008261546050652536, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:6541cccf-dad2-4616-9f87-d8404cd02ee9>", "text": "Project Description: *\nBriefly describe the project objectives.\nBriefly describe the need or problem driving the proposed project and the customers and anticipated consumers of the project’s product.\nBriefly describe the product of the project that would resolve the business need or problem.\nBriefly describe the anticipated benefits resulting directly from the project.

The first is Show # 98, October 14, my interview with Prof. Jacqui Lipton of Case Western Reserve University School of Law. Jacqui is writing a book, Global Real Property: Internet Domain Names, Trademark and Free Speech, examining the intricacies of trademark domain name disputes. These disputes take a number of forms, and have a variety of permutations that require consideration. In the discussion, we dissect these different disputes and discuss how they can best be handled, while examining the role of domain names in the operations of the Internet. I hope that you enjoy the interview!\nThe second show, Show #99, October 21, is my interview with Prof. Elizabeth Townsend Gard and Justin Levy of Tulane University Law School, creators of the forthcoming Durationator. Anyone who is familiar with copyright law knows how difficult it can be to determine whether a work is copyright protected or not. The Durationator is designed to solve that problem by offering a tool that allows one to find out an answer to that basic, but extremely difficult, question for any work of authorship. In the interview, we discuss the genesis and purpose of the project, and the future of copyright on a going forward basis.

For example, in writing this guidance note, or in the taking of a photograph, copyright is created in the corresponding text and image.\nThe default position in UK law is that the first owner of copyright in a work will be the author: for example, the writer of an article, the photographer in respect of a photograph, and so on.\nWhere the law deviates from the above is in circumstances of employment. The first owner of copyright created “in the course of employment” is the employer, not the employee.\nDisputes can arise between employees and employers if they both stake respective ownership claims in what may be valuable work. Where an employee’s role changes from what was originally set out in their employment contract or if they create work outside of what is expected of them “in the course of their employment”, ownership can become unclear.\nTherefore, to reduce the risk of dispute, regular employment contract audits are recommended. Specific IP clauses can also be included in employment contracts which clearly set out the rights position. Managing employee expectations at an early stage can invariably be more cost effective than arguing the issue in court, when it could be too late.\nOutside of employment, when third party independent contractors are commissioned/retained to produce content for a business, copyright disputes can also arise.\nOne of the highest potential risks of dispute is in regard to the creation of a website. A new website will often involve creating text, graphics, images, and video content, authored by the contractor. Who owns that content?\nAbsent any contractual terms agreed between the parties, the first owner of copyright in the content is the contractor, not the paying party. Ownership of copyright does not automatically transfer upon payment. It matters little how much has been paid to the contractor for the work.\nIn most scenarios, this may not be a problem: provided that the contractor is paid, they may have little interest or value in retaining/reusing or restricting use of the content.\nHowever, when disputes arise over payment for example, the commissioning party can be denied permission to use content for which they believe they have already paid.\nTherefore, it is recommended that clear contract terms (T&Cs) are put in place beforehand so that each party’s responsibilities are set out and, in the case of copyright, rights transfer upon payment.", "score": 0.0003032762244891762, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:d64837c0-d23f-4310-88a6-86147900c699>", "text": "—It is quite clear that copyright is a species of fixed capital. When a publisher buys the copyright of a popular work, it is manifest that is part of his capital. When an author produces a work for which there is a popular demand, and whose copyright is therefore valuable property, he is unquestionably producing wealth.\n—The introduction of this species of property into political economy which can by no possibility be excluded from it, shows the inconsistency of the fundamental conceptions of many writers. Thus Mr. Mill, who says that everything forms a part of wealth which has a power of purchasing, and therefore admits, by implication, that a copyright is wealth, speaks of the production of wealth as the extraction of the instruments of human subsistence and enjoyment from the materials of the globe, thereby very nearly agreeing with Adam Smith's notion of wealth, as the produce of land and labor. But how is a copyright extracted from the materials of the globe? How is it the produce of land and labor?\n—It also shows that some theorems which he lays down as fundamental, are not so. Thus he says that all capital is the result of saving. But how is a copyright the result of saving? He also states as another fundamental theorem, that although saved, and the result of saving, all capital is nevertheless consumed. But how is a copyright consumed? He says that \"capital is kept in existence from age to age, not by preservation, but by perpetual reproduction; every part of it is used and destroyed, generally very soon after it is produced, but those who consume it are employed meanwhile in producing more.\" (Vol. i., p. 92.) But how is copyright kept in existence by perpetual reproduction? How does the owner of a valuable copyright consume it, and how is hé employed in producing more? These are examples of hasty generalization from too small an induction of facts.\n—Copyright, we thus see, is a species of valuable property, produced entirely by the demand of the public for works of literature and art. It is thus purely the creation of diffused civilization and education, and could not have any existence, except from the educated taste of the public, and unless there were the means of gratifying it at a moderate expense.\n—It has been discussed whether there was any copyright among the ancients.

These were turbulent times for the publishing industry, not least because the legal frameworks that governed who could publish and what could be published underwent radical transformations throughout the period. In the late seventeenth century, only members of the London-based Stationers’ Company could publish books or own copyrights. In 1710, the Statute of Anne extended the right to “copy” to all English citizens. Some few decades later in 1741, English Chancery courts created precedent for modern fair use law by ruling that books that derived heavily from others could be found non-infringing in certain cases. Near the end of the century in 1774, English courts legalized a vast public domain of intellectual property by ruling that copyright protections expire a fixed number of years after the initial publication of a work. These and many other legal changes during the eighteenth century created the dynamic foundation on which the modern book market was built.1\nThis new world of statutory copyright law had a profound influence on the development of the modern author. When eighteenth-century writers and publishers took to the courts to defend the copyright protections they were granted by the 1710 Statute of Anne, they forced English judges to identify exactly what an individual may claim as intellectual property. A series of highly influential cases during the period led judges to identify public matters of fact—such as the names of roads in a British county, or the list of words in the English language—as “unauthored, uncreated ‘facts’ or ‘sources’” [Aoki 26]. Legal scholar Keith Aoki has demonstrated that authors’ attempts to claim copyright control over publications based on these public matters of fact were then “justified or denied on the basis of how much or how little an author-like figure ha[d] intervened, transforming pre-existing raw ‘sources’ and ‘facts’ into something ‘original’” [Aoki 26]. Originality therefore became a fundamental focal point of both literary discourse and copyright disputes in late eighteenth-century England.", "score": 4.727241921749079e-05, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:3ba6709c-f2ab-436c-9690-d7e42d666160>", "text": "More adults with mental illness smoke - and smoke more - than those who don’t have a diagnosed mental illness, according to results from a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study released today.\nSmoking rates are 70 percent higher for the mentally ill in the United States, according to the study, which was done in collaboration with the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\nAbout 36 percent of adults with a mental illness are cigarette smokers in the United States, compared with 21 percent of those who are not diagnosed with a mental illness.\nThe CDC says the results of the study shows there is an opportunity for better treatment for people from all walks of life.\n“Smokers with mental illness, like other smokers, want to quit and can quit,” said Tom Frieden, the director of the CDC. “Stop-smoking treatments work – and it’s important to make them more available to all people who want to quit.”\nSmokers who are mentally ill also smoke more than their peers – at a rate of 331 to 310 cigarettes per month, according to the findings.\nStates’ smoking rates vary from state to state, as well.

Asking \"how do I create one\" is like asking \"How do I make a car?\"\nGame Engines can be massive pieces of software that consist of a dozen subsystems. Think of a Game Engine as a collection of subsystems that all work together to govern how a game performs; it's logic like collision detection, rendering of images, handling user input from the mouse and keyboard, and audio support for playing sound effects and music, among others, each represent a separate subsystem the determines the rules of the game. Your input handling subsystem for example will determine what actions the system must perform if you press the 'w' key or right click with the mouse.\nAs an example of how a subsystem might work: within any game you have your main game loop. Basically the way it works is each iteration of the game loop will, for example, accept user input, update the coordinates of graphics, etc... depending on the users interaction and the game/object states.\nSince a Game Engine is really a massive collection of objects interacting with each other, the game engine monitors the states of each object and will execute tasks against them. For example you may have something as simple as this:\nshort int hitPoints;\nshort int magicPoints;\nAt any given time the game knows where player is in the world and can update it's x/y coordinates based on players interactions. Say for example you hit the 'w' key, then the input system may know to increase your coordinates and move your player up. Your rendering subsystem may then update the screen to show your player move. Ultimately the best way to learn how to create a game engine is to try programming each of the subsystems and have them interact with each other. Again, this is just to nudge you in the right direction. Game Engines can be more complicated than most systems out there.\nTo give you a broad idea of the types of systems and their interactions, take a look at the engine architecture diagram for the C4 Game Engine: http://www.terathon.com/c4engine/architecture.php.\nI also recommend reading the book Game Engine Architecture http://www.amazon.com/Game-Engine-Architecture-Jason-Gregory/dp/1568814135.\nIt is an advanced book on engine architecture, but it's the best on the market and my Architecture Bible.", "score": 0.852605343, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:52bb441f-49d2-46b0-b1cc-955c412db2cb>", "text": "Game Engine Highlights –\n– Sprite() – Onscreen, movable, scalable objects\n– Game states – Separate sections of your game for better organized code\n– SpriteSheet() and Animation() – Load spritesheets and animate frames\n– Assets – Jaws will preload all your images before the game starts\n– Documented code and explained examples\n• Objected Oriented: all items displayed are objects\n• Multiplatform: runs in iOS, Android, Mac, Windows browsers\n• Windows 8: supports development for Windows 8 interactive HTML5\n• Event-driven: based on asynchronous processing via event listeners\n• Animation Engine: allows the use of standard animation such as tweens\n• Hybrid Drawing: supports drawing with both the Canvas API and the DOM\n• WebGL Support: supports 3D games using WebGL with a plugin\n• Content Library: includes a royalty-free image library for use in your games\ntraffic cone is 2D and 2.5D tile based game engine, its client side written in HTML5.\n• Easily configurable sprite animations\n• Simple to set up tile based worlds\n• Mock-3D math for layering, depth and positioning is handled for you via Traffic Cone’s world models.\n• Basic Isometric pathfinding, AI and collision detection\n• Custom draw routines on sprites supported.\n• Granular control of sprite sequencing supported for more dramatic animations\n• Intelligent draw logic only draws modified parts of your canvas for better frame rates.\nFlashJS is one of the great graphics and game development engine API, This This library allows to develop HTML5 games and applications in the way that is similar to ordinary AS3 development.

The repository has also seemed pretty inactive.\nHere is a sample of the current demo modules of JevaEngine and the world editor. They look the same (and admittedly could use some polishing) but they come after some major refactors on the engine. More details below the video.\nI have been refactoring JevaEngine over the last month or so. These refactors come with some very important architectural changes that pushes JevaEngine towards a more flexible and powerful engine. I will be detailing the changes within the next few weeks once the refactored engine has been pushed to the repository. Below I will list some of the key changes to JevaEngine.\n- All use of service locator pattern has been refactored out of the engine. The service locator pattern was used in JevaEngine to acquire an interface to the concrete implementation of Game, and to acquire an interface to the globally accessible asset factory (opening raw InputStreams to the game's filesystem.) This provided a convenient way for one to construct entities, open configuration files from anywhere inside of JevaEngine. However it also carried some issues, mainly allowing for global access to these resources (forcing factories to be thread safe) and hiding code smells that would usually become obvious.\n- JevaEngine has now switched to an entirely Dependency Injection based model of passing around dependencies, using Guice to bootstrap the engine with the appropriate dependencies. This has allowed for more flexibility inside of JevaEngine. Including the ability to bootstrap JevaEngine with custom world, sprite, script, entity, physics and asset factories - allowing one to easily integrate custom file formats and scripting/physics engine seamlessly into JevaEngine.\n- World projection has been entirely decoupled from the engine. Meaning one can implement various render perspectives into JevaEngine seamlessly. JevaEngine is no longer focused specifically towards Isometric Games, it can also focus towards platformers and top-down games. While no such implementations have been tested, it is theoretically possible to easily integrate these perspectives into JevaEngine.\n- The world builder has been entirely reconstructed. The previous implementation was falling apart - mainly due to complications introduced by using the Swing UI subsystem so heavily. JevaEngine's new world builder is entirely based around the JevaEngine UI subsystem. This allows for a much more functional and cleaner implementation.\n- JevaEngine now delegates Window construction to an injected Window Factory.", "score": 0.007984148276404542, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:8dd1b6d4-7125-481b-9ba4-34fcc98a8be8>", "text": "Ruby is made from unfermented ruby cocoa beans that have a natural red-pink color.

This is not a chocolate with added colourants, flavouring or aromas: it is the product derived from a very special and different cocoa called RUBY, responsible for its pinkish color and characteristic flavor, obtained naturally and without additives.\nThere is great curiosity about this product among gourmets and cooking and pastry professionals. That is why the World Gastronomy Institute (WGI) decided to carry out a preliminary study about Ruby Chocolate in 2020, convening an ´Experts Panel` to develop a ´Tasting Sheet` and select the best pairings for Ruby Chocolate. Among the specialists there were Chefs, Gastronomers, Sensory Tasters, Anthropologists, Winemakers, Baristas, Sommeliers and, of course, Pastry chefs. The experts discussed Ruby and expressed their opinions anonymously, avoiding conditioning their opinions. Different brands were tested such as: Cacao Sampaka, Nestlé (Chocolate Bar «Les Reccetes de L´Atelier» with Raspberry), KitKat made with Ruby Cocoa beans and even an ice cream, the Magnum Ruby, with creamy white chocolate and raspberry with Ruby chocolate coating.

These three chocolates were, for most people, an irrevocable, unquestioned fact of life right alongside the seven colors of the rainbow or the five human senses.\nThis all changed in September 2017, when the Swiss cocoa company Barry Callebaut officially announced a fourth type of chocolate: ruby chocolate. While only a little over a year old now, ruby chocolate’s rise to prominence is all but inevitable. Austin culinary students would do well to familiarize themselves with this nascent phenomenon sooner rather than later.\nWhat is ruby chocolate?\nRuby chocolate looks very much like what happens when you dye white chocolate so that it has a deep, rich pink color. However, the coloring here is entirely natural. The pink hue that gives this new type of chocolate its name is derived from ruby cocoa beans sourced in Ivory Coast, Ecuador and Brazil, according to The Chocolate Journalist.\nRuby cocoa beans are not exactly a new discovery. However, Zurich-based Barry Callebaut, one of the world’s largest cocoa producers and grinders, claimed it found a way to process ruby cocoa beans after years of research.\n“The Ruby bean is unique because the fresh berry-fruitiness and color precursors are naturally present,” the chocolate producer wrote in its initial press release. “The bean has a specific set of attributes, which Barry Callebaut managed to unlock through an innovative process that took many years to develop.”\nNot much is known about how Barry Callebaut processed the chocolate just yet. But what we do know is that the end result is a distinctly smooth, berry-like flavor that is at once sour and sweet.\nCooking with ruby chocolate: Flash in a pan or new tradition?\nSeveral chocolate companies have already begun selling ruby chocolate bars, including London’s Fortnum and Mason and, more prominently, Nestle. Japanese patissier Yasumasa Takagi created a new KitKat bar for Nestle called the “Chocolatory Sublime Ruby Kit-Kat” in early 2018 for release in Korea and Japan.

In this post, we’ll explain what vegan chocolate is and what to look out for.\nWhat is Vegan Chocolate?\nVegan chocolate is chocolate that’s suitable for the vegan diet. This means it doesn’t contain any animal products.\nA good bar of dark chocolate should only contain a few ingredients. This includes cocoa beans, cocoa butter, sugar, and sometimes a plant-based emulsifier.\nChocolate that isn’t suitable for vegans is milk or white chocolate that uses cow or other animal milk powder. However, there is a growing trend of alternative milk chocolate bars on the market. Alternative milk chocolate is made with plant-based powders, such as coconut or oat milk.\nIf you’re unsure about what’s in your chocolate, then your safest bet is to check the ingredients list. The ingredients list will reveal what’s in your bar.\nA Quick Overview:\nHere’s a quick overview to help you decide whether your chocolate is vegan or not:\n|Dark chocolate||✅||Dark chocolate has a high cocoa content and shouldn’t contain any animal-based products.|\n|Dark-milk chocolate||✅||If the milk is alternative milk (like coconut or oat), then the chocolate is fine for vegans.|\n|Milk chocolate||✅||Same as the above. Check the ingredients to determine if the milk is plant-based.|\n|White chocolate||✅||Vegan white chocolate exists. Similar to milk chocolate, check whether the white chocolate is made with plant-based milk.|\n|Ruby chocolate||❌||Ruby chocolate is made with milk powder and is not suitable for vegans.|\nWhat About Bone Char Sugar?\nUnfortunately, not all sugar is vegan! Some refined sugar contains bone char. Bone char is made from cattle and other animal bones and is often used in the sugar industry to achieve a certain colour. It can be found in both brown sugar and confectioners white sugar.\nThis of course will determine whether your chocolate bar is vegan or not as well!

Every year, consumers spend $ 7 billion on this delicacy, and sales peak can be observed at the end of autumn.\nThere are several basic types of chocolate. Dark chocolate is made from cocoa butter, cocoa liquor and powdered sugar. This type of chocolate has much fewer admirers, but it is considered to be the safest because it contains a minimum of sugar and there is no cream or milk. Milk chocolate is more popular: it is sweeter than the bitter and it contains more calories. Milk chocolate ingredients include cocoa liquor (but in much smaller quantities than in bitter chocolate), sugar, cocoa butter, cream or milk. Unscrupulous manufacturers add soy into chocolate that significantly affects the taste and quality of the product. Therefore, one should pay attention to the composition of chocolate – there should not be any soy. Another popular variety of this comfort food is white chocolate. It is distinguished from the milk chocolate by the absence of chocolate liquor in the composition.

This understanding is essential for leading a successful life as it helps us to stay away from sin and evil deeds.\n2. The Quran increases our knowledge and understanding of Islam. It is a source of wisdom that can be applied in our daily lives.\n3. Learning the Quran develops our relationship with Allah. It instills in us love and fear for Him, and strengthens our faith.\n4. The Quran improves our character and personality. By following its teachings, we become better people who are obedient to Allah, compassionate towards others, and patient in adversity.\n5. The Quran provides solace and comfort in times of hardship and difficulty. Its verses give hope and reassurance to those who are troubled or grieving.\n6. Finally, learning the Quran is a great blessing from Allah Himself. It is an opportunity that should not be missed by any Muslim who wishes to please Him and earn His rewards in this life and the hereafter.\nWhat are some challenges of learning the Quran?\nOne of the biggest challenges of learning the Quran is finding enough time to dedicate to study. The Quran is a sacred text that Muslims believe was revealed by God to the Prophet Muhammad, and as such, it is revered and studied with great care. However, life can often get in the way, and it can be difficult to find dedicated periods of time to read and understand the Quran.\nAnother challenge is understanding the Arabic language. The Quran is written in Arabic, and while many Muslims learn some Arabic in order to pray or read the Quran, not everyone is fluent in the language. This can make comprehension difficult, especially for those who are not used to reading classical Arabic literature. There are many resources available to help with this, but it can still be a challenge.\nFinally, another challenge of learning the Quran is staying motivated. It can be easy to get bogged down or discouraged when studying such a long and dense text, but it is important to remember why you are doing it. For Muslims, learning the Quran is a way to connect with God and understand His will for their lives. It is a lifetime journey, and one that can be immensely rewarding if you stick with it.\nTips for learning the Quran\n1. Start with the basics: learning how to read and pronounce the Arabic alphabet.

Recently we came across an object of particular interest, a tool from a relatively simple grave known as PG 422. Apart from telling us something about the potential activities of the person buried here, it also tells us about the specific use of this kind of tool, as it preserves information that is normally missing—the handle.\nMost of the graves in the ‘Royal Cemetery’ at Ur were far from grandiose. Woolley only assigned the designator ‘royal’ to sixteen of the more than 1,800 graves he uncovered here. It could easily be said that these sixteen get an inordinate amount of attention due to the gold jewelry and other fabulously attractive objects within them. So, this month I want to show that less elaborate graves are of great interest as well.\nIndeed, the vast majority of graves at Ur are basic inhumations, a long pit dug into the ground with a body placed in along with a few grave goods. Some were wrapped in matting, others had coffins of sorts. What were these more common people like? Surely we should pay attention to them, since they were the majority, making up the society itself.\nWoolley didn’t report the common graves as thoroughly as we might wish—he didn’t save bones from them nor did he draw or photograph most of them. He did, however, catalogue artifacts from most of them and from these we might understand something of the activities that involved average Mesopotamians.\nThis assumes that the goods left with the dead reflect their activities in life, and such does seem to be the case in Mesopotamia. Ritual goods, such as representations of gods and goddesses, are not regularly found in the graves of Ur, but occupational tools often are. Pottery is the most common artifact to be found in graves and this is almost surely related to the belief in a need for sustenance in the afterlife rather than showing that everyone was a potter.", "score": 0.822679222, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:029e7f4d-1189-4a49-b37a-ecd12db4deca>", "text": "Ships to: Worldwide,\nItem:153773426542CLICK HERE FOR MORE ITEMS!

We do not know whether the burial pits were dug and tomb chambers constructed before the death of their occupants or whether they were hastily prepared afterwards, the more likely alternative.

Hallo, makes both comparisons and contrasts, recognizing the autonomy and interdependence of ancient Israel and Mesopotamia (Hallo 1997).\nThis steers a middle course between the extremism of the Pan-Babylonianists and of those who would build a fence around the Bible and claim that Israel was somehow exempt from the dynamic influences of Mesopotamia, the greatest cultural centre in Western Asia during the first millennium BCE.\nNo serious student of the Bible can ignore Mesopotamian civilization, but the religious experiences of both Mesopotamia and the Hebrews have to be understood in their own terms before they can be profitably compared or contrasted.”\nBenjamin R.

His assessment of Russia’s annexation of Crimea coincides nicely with that presented by Russian President Vladimir Putin and on Russian television and he has simply ignored grave human rights concerns under Russian occupation.\nIn February and March 2014 Russian troops seized control and forcibly annexed Crimea.

Corbyn’s justification for non-intervention is much less so. He first expressed his views on March 8, 2014, two days after the leaders who had been installed at gunpoint had announced a largely alternative-less ‘referendum’ on joining Russia to be held ten days later, on March 16. Corbyn did note that “Russia has gone way beyond its legal powers to use bases in the Crimea.

Accordingly, we consider the ISEER displayed on the BEE star label as accurate for our calculation purposes.\nWe shall look at some of the terms used in our calculator.\nISEER – Indian Seasonal Energy Efficiency Ratio\nBefore we go into understanding ISEER, we should clear a couple of concepts.\nCSEC – Cooling Seasonal Energy Consumption\nCSEC denotes the total annual energy consumed by the air conditioner when operating in the active mode.\nCSTL – Cooling Seasonal Total Load\nCSTL is the total annual amount of heat removed from the indoor air when the air conditioner operates in the active mode.\nISEER – Calculation\nISEER is the ratio of CSEC and CSTL. The ISEER is a complex calculation because you do not use the AC at a fixed temperature and for fixed hours daily. Your preferences vary according to the season and the room temperature. The Bureau of Energy Efficiency assumes that the average consumption by Indian households in a year is approximately 1600 hours.\nBEE has considered the temperature profile based on the weather profile for a total of 54 cities. It considers a range of temperatures from 24 degrees Celsius to 43 degrees Celsius to arrive at the average annual hourly consumption.\nRelated: BEE Star Ratings\nCooling Capacity of the AC\nThe BEE Star label provides two different cooling capacities for inverter ACs, one at 100% and the other at 50%. It helps to calculate the AC compressor’s run time. The run-time concept for inverter ACs and non-inverter ACs is different.\nThe compressor in an inverter AC does not stop functioning throughout the time the AC is in operation. However, it runs at variable speed. Hence, the total power consumption is not constant throughout. As the compressor speed increases, so does the power consumption, and vice versa.\nThe non-inverter AC compressors run at a single speed (maximum) until the set temperature is reached. Therefore, it consumes maximum power during this period. Then, it switches off completely. Once the temperature reaches the threshold level, it starts functioning again. Thus, the compressor does not consume any power when it is not running. Therefore, the power consumption of a non-inverter AC is also not constant throughout its operation.", "score": 0.840928197, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:cfb8d0cf-bd5e-4cc6-a3d0-5b8a74b56cc6>", "text": "The duty cycle is how much time the compressor can safely run within a given period of time, expressed as a ratio. For example, a common duty cycle for compressors is 50/50, meaning that the compressor motor can run about half the time it is supplying air to your tools... 50 minutes on and 50 minutes off. During the \"on\" time, the motor is pressurizing the tank. During the \"off\" time, your tools are running on the air stored under pressure in the tank. If your tools are draining the pressure off too fast, the compressor engine must run at more than a 50/50 rate which can lead to overheating and significantly shorten compressor life.\nThis also applies to gasoline powered compressors. Yes, the motor runs all the time, but it is not always under a load. The duty cycle applies to the amount of time the motor is under a load vs. time not under a load. Of course, the most sturdy compressors have a 100% duty cycle, meaning that they can output air continuously. These, of course, are also the most expensive commercial units.\nWhat about horsepower ratings? You can pretty much ignore horsepower when shopping compressors, especially when comparing different manufacturers. First, horsepower figures are not reliable from manufacturer to manufacturer, especially on electric-powered units because there are different ways to measure it. Secondly, the CFM and pressure ratings of an air compressor are a true measure of the overall power and efficiency of the compressor. For example, a more efficient air pump can produce greater CFM with less horsepower!\nSo in summary:\n1) Choose the air tools you are going to buy.\n2) Determine the \"highest\" pressure needed by them and the \"total\" CFM needed... add the requirements of all tools you may run simultaneously.\n3) Multiply your needed CFM by 1.5 to allow for a little \"cushion\" so that your compressor is not overworked. Add a little more to the CFM number if you anticipate future air tool purchases.\n4) Go shopping! Now that you know the basics, you will be able to focus in on a few compressor models making your comparison shopping less confusing.\nCOPYRIGHT 1999 G.G.

They ensure that the system will run within the application constraints. The drive can also manage other devices such as oil injection valves or multiple compressors.

During stalled operation, the average air flow through the compressor is steady, but during surge, the flow rate will rapidly (milliseconds, msec) pulse—sometimes so violently that reverse flow is induced, often accompanied by a loud “bang.”In extreme cases, a sudden combustor-induced flame may shoot out the back end of the machine (Fig 5) and possibly out of the compressor inlet as well. This now puts the operating point on the surge line as shown in the figure-2.\nTypically the PI (Proportional Integral) control algorithm will active and start to modulate the anti surge control valve if the compressor operates between the control line and the surge line. The time required for the low spool to increase its rpm is now sufficiently long for the Fadec to sense the unusual relationship between low- and high-spool speeds and be able to activate a bleed to prevent the occurrence of surge.Another example: Aircraft gas turbines operating in severe rain or hail storms where extra fuel is required to process and evaporate the water being swallowed by the engine.

At the same time, the compression temperature drops, which allows longer duty cycles and therefore increases the air delivery per hour, while the stroke volume remains the same.\nOutside delivery operation, the newly developed idle system SLS significantly reduces fuel consumption.\nAs a result of reduced temperatures, the engine oil is subjected to less stress. Oil cracking and the formation of harmful substances are therefore prevented.\nThe newly developed TwinSave technology is also applicable to various other Voith compressors. TwinSave comes with an additional control valve in the second compressor stage and external actuation. These features allow for operation with a closed pressure line.\nIn delivery operation, both control valves are closed (normally closed) in order for the compressor to compress and deliver the air in both stages. In idling mode, the control valves are open, which means that neither of the two compressor stages compresses the air and it is circulating inside the unit. Compared to the selfactuating idle system (SLS), Twin Save enables further energy savings of up to 25 percent. In addition, TwinSave technology contributes to the reduction of the mechanical strain on the pressurized components and thus helps to extend their lifetime.\nTraveling economically and saving the environment at the same time – auxiliary units such as air compressors in trucks and buses contribute significantly to this.

Europe’s Energy-related Products (ErP) directive (2009/125/EC) imposes tough power consumption and efficiency targets for items such as complete appliances as well as sub-assemblies such as fans and circulator pumps. These targets must be met in order to gain the CE mark necessary to permit sale anywhere in the EU.\nIn addition, energy labelling of domestic appliances forces manufacturers to strive for better efficiency in order to maintain market share. The European targets have been increased in the latest Energy Labelling Directive (2010/30/EU), as more and more appliances have achieved the top \"A-grade\" and the EU expects new technologies to yield a further 50% reduction in the energy consumption of an A-class product. In practice, the energy efficiency targets of the latest ecodesign regulations will require OEMs to replace existing designs with more energy efficient systems.\nTaking the refrigerator as an example of a typical domestic appliance covered by the ErP and energy labelling directives, the compressor is a key subsystem responsible for a significant proportion of the total energy consumed. By upgrading traditional on-off compressor control using more sophisticated techniques, designers can not only save a significant proportion of energy consumed but can also achieve improvements such as quieter operation and improved temperature control.\nThe established design practice is to size the compressor system to provide the maximum required cooling capacity under worst-case operating conditions, such as during the summer and taking into account opening and closing of the door. Although the maximum demand is rarely imposed, a system with simple on/off control draws the rated power whenever it is activated. Hence the system consumes excessive energy simply to maintain the desired temperature under most operating conditions.\nUsing a fixed-speed compressor with simple on-off control can also result in relatively unstable cabinet temperature. This is because the temperature will fall quickly to below the desired set point when the over-sized compressor is turned on, and then rise above the set point before rapid cooling begins again.", "score": 0.05902755013650414, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:1f189719-bdde-4514-a3dc-ff57b622a12a>", "text": "3 ways advanced master controllers reduce energy consumption\nAdvanced master controllers can manage multiple compressors of different sizes as well as select the right mix of compressors to meet the current demand for compressed air whilst at the same time reducing energy consumption in 3 key ways:\n- By reducing compressor run and idling times; for every hour of operation a typical compressor will accumulate several minutes of unnecessary run and idle time. By operating only the compressor units required to meet the current compressed air demand, advanced master controllers can save anywhere from 2 to 10 % in energy costs. At the same time compressor starts and switching losses are reduced.\nIdle time in part-load conditions is also reduced as the advanced master controller will determine which compressor units have the best specific performance and therefore maximise full-load operation.\n- By improving pressure performance; unlike outdated sequencers that use cascading pressure controls with wide pressure bands, advanced master controllers are able to recognise changes in air pressure quickly and accurately and can therefore maintain tighter pressure control. Advanced master controllers also allow lower average system pressures. Along with better air pressure stability approx. 10% energy savings can be commonly achieved using this approach.\n- By reducing artificial demand and leaks; artificial demand is created where users set the systems air pressure higher than actually needed to compensate for e.g. pressure drop and potential air leaks. The result – energy is wasted.\nWith advanced adaptive master controllers the user can reduce the pressure while at the same time avoiding under pressurising equipment and tools. Being able to operate at a lower pressure will reduce both artificial demand and leak losses. As a rule of thumb every 0.15 bar reduction in compressor pressure will result in a 1% reduction in power consumption. For example, an operating pressure reduction from 8.5 bar to 7 bar would reduce the flow rate through a 6 mm orifice from 3.5 m3/min to 3 m3/min. This would result in almost 20% in savings! Depending on system size, even a 5% reduction in pressure would result in substantial savings.\nWhen it comes to operating an energy efficient compressed air system, today’s sophisticated and advanced master controllers gives compressed air users unparalleled access to optimal performance and reliability – perfectly matching compressed air supply to demand for optimum energy efficiency.\nIs a master controller the right option for your compressed air system?

This method varies refrigerant flow by actually changing the speed of the compressor. The turndown ratio depends on the system configuration and manufacturer. It modulates from 10% (depending on the compressor model) up to 100% at full capacity with a single inverter.\nAir-conditioning is responsible for approximately 20% of the total annual electricity consumption in a country like the USA. The introduction of inverter drive technology in air-conditioning and heat pump systems presents an opportunity for significant energy savings due to efficient part-load operation, and also helps improve power quality of the grid.\nPower factor is an important measure of how hard the power utility must work to deliver electricity.\nIncreasing the power factor of installations can directly impact the quality of power supply.

This can cause some problems in case batteries are used for power supply. In extreme cases, the only solution is to set the whole electronics in sleep mode in order to minimize consumption. A typical example is a TV remote controller: it can be out of use for months but when used again it takes less than a second to send a command to TV receiver. The AT89S53 uses approximately 25mA for regular operation, which doesn't make it a pover-saving microcontroller. Anyway, it doesn’t have to be always like that, it can easily switch the operating mode in order to reduce its total consumption to approximately 40uA. Actually, there are two power-saving modes of operation: Idle and Power Down.\nUpon the IDL bit of the PCON register is set, the microcontroller turns off the greatest power consumer- CPU unit while peripheral units such as serial port, timers and interrupt system continue operating normally consuming 6.5mA. In Idle mode, the state of all registers and I/O ports remains unchanged.\nIn order to exit the Idle mode and make the microcontroller operate normally, it is necessary to enable and execute any interrupt or reset. It will cause the IDL bit to be automatically cleared and the program resumes operation from instruction having set the IDL bit. It is recommended that first three instructions to execute now are NOP instructions. They don't perform any operation but provide some time for the microcontroller to stabilize and prevents undesired changes on the I/O ports.\nPower Down mode\nBy setting the PD bit of the PCON register from within the program, the microcontroller is set to Power down mode, thus turning off its internal oscillator and reduces power consumption enormously.", "score": 0.004657790929997972, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:85a99d42-0f19-4b4d-984a-67c3df3b4ca3>", "text": "- Outdoor unit extracts heat from the outdoor air, even at -20°C\n- Single phase outdoor unit with bottom plate heater\nGuaranteed operation down to -20°C\nDaikin Altherma is suitable for all climates, even withstanding severe winter conditions with an operation range down to -20°C\nInverter compressors continuously adjust compressor speed to actual demand.

Nutritional therapy can help alleviate a wide range of conditions and assist in the recovery from many ill-health situations. Nutritional therapists recognise that each person is an individual who has unique dietary and nutritional requirements. (Nutritional Therapy Council)\nThrough the use of dietary and lifestyle changes, and supplementation when appropriate, nutritional therapy aims to maximise your health and address heath concerns. Everyone is unique and through an analysis of factors such as your diet, environment, family history, and current lifestyle, an individual, tailored programme can be compiled for you.\nWhat we eat is fundamental to how we feel and we are more likely to stay healthy for longer if we feed our body with the right nutrients. Each food choice you make – a meal, a snack or something you grab in a hurry, has an impact on your body in a positive or a negative way. There is a lot more information now about healthy eating but it can be difficult to see how it applies to your daily diet. I can help people realise how changes to their diet and lifestyle can be incorporated into their life.\nYou do not need to have a specific condition for nutritional therapy to be beneficial. It can be that you are feeling low in energy, ‘under the weather’ or would like to understand how you can help yourself to keep healthy. Also, nutritional therapy doesn’t just treat symptoms; it works on the underlying causes of health problems and balancing the body to enable it to work effectively.\nWhat can nutritional therapy help with?\nThe following are some of the health concerns that nutritional therapy can help to address:\nDepression and anxiety\nBlood sugar issues and diabetes\nHeadaches and migraines\nHigh blood pressure / cholesterol\nFood allergies / intolerance\nFrequent coughs and colds\nPrior to our first appointment, I will ask you to complete a simple but detailed questionnaire that will provide me with a picture of your health, lifestyle and current diet.

They were limited in their ability to report clinical and anthropometric outcomes for women, the duration of those outcomes, and the feasibility of scaling up programs. There is also a need for systematic, long-term evaluations of interventions whose effects on nutrition outcomes are more distal (e.g., nutrition education compared with micronutrient supplementation). The effects of multisectoral interventions are even more complex to measure. However, frameworks exist to evaluate complex interventions (102) and could be utilized to evaluate the impact of interventions across the life course.\nAdopting a plant-based diet could help tip the scales in your favor. A five-year study of 71,751 adults published in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics found that vegetarians tend to be slimmer than meat-eaters even though both groups eat about the same number of calories daily. Researchers say it may be because carnivores consume more fatty acids and fewer weight-loss promoting nutrients, like fiber, than herbivores do. Go green to find out if it works for you.\nThe recommended daily intake for vitamin E is 15 mg. Don't take more than 1,000 mg of alpha-tocopherol per day. This amount is equivalent to approximately 1,500 IU of \"d-alpha-tocopherol,\" sometimes labeled as \"natural source\" vitamin E, or 1,100 IU of \"dl-alpha-tocopherol,\" a synthetic form of vitamin E. Consuming more than this could increase your risk of bleeding because vitamin E can act as an anticoagulant (blood thinner).\nGrains, vegetables and fruits are essential to getting the vitamins, minerals, complex carbohydrates (starch and dietary fiber) and other nutrients you need to sustain good health.

Three topics were central to me throughout the conference; 1. the idea of using the study of games (usually labelled “game studies”, appropriately) and their understanding of games as our foundation for game based learning, 2. the idea that assumptions regarding games and game based learning must be constantly challenged, e.g. the notion that games automatically foster motivation, and 3. the idea that games should not be directly integrated into exisiting teaching practice, as they should be used to leverage new was of teaching.\nOne thing that always strikes me, when working with games, is the multitude of perceptions.\nPeople think all kinds of different things, when thinking about games.\nOne discourse, which have been hampering the use of games for anything than entertainment, is the rather crude idea, that games make players more violent. Trying to be just a little provocative, I wrote a post on how “I kill people“, in which I tried to shed some light on the actual research in the field of video games and violence. The conclusion? “We are nowhere near any final conclusions”.\nIn continuation of this, I’ve been discussing if “games can get too close?“. Time and time again, we see discussions about whether or not games should be allowed to tackle contemporary issues like terrorism and war. “Books, songs, television and movies have been depicting painful events for years on end, and they all caused quite a commotion; at least in the beginning. Why are games not allowed to follow suit?”\nI’ve also been looking at “games as arguments” in an attempt to explore, how games can be used as media to promote ideas or arguments. “Could a game persuade you? To think differently? To vote differently? To change your perspective on the world? To buy another brand of milk?”.\nThere’s a widespread perception, that games are not real; or, to elaborate, what takes place in games is not real. The rapid growth of “virtual consumption” radically challenges this notion, because what are you buying, if what you’re buying doesn’t exist?

The overall aim of my research is to identify complementary theory-based psychosocial factors that impact adherence to physical activity. I am also interested in designing and testing theory-based interventions that target changes in problematic psychosocial factors in order to enhance adherence and, in turn, health and well-being. I have expertise in studying psychosocial predictors of adherence among healthy individuals as well as individuals with chronic disease. I am especially interested in adults with arthritis or, more broadly, adults with chronic pain. Public health recommendations are that adults should engage in at least 150 minutes each week of moderate to vigorous activity. However, individuals with chronic disease often times struggle to meet this recommendation, thereby not achieving both health and disease self-management benefits. Thus, identifying psychosocial factors that differentiate adults with chronic disease who are more or less active is one area of focus. I investigate activity-related psychosocial factors (e.g., barriers, self-regulatory efficacy beliefs) and disease-specific factors (e.g., pain acceptance).

While this infrastructure is designed primarily to meet the needs of individual TEI projects and researchers, it also serves an important role for the TEI community itself, in two ways: first, by supporting the aggregation and study of TEI data more broadly; and second, by creating additional foci of community activity and interaction. The challenge lies in designing these tools so that they balance these important goals. We propose a panel session focused on a discussion of the needs of individual researchers and of the TEI research community, including representatives of three major infrastructural projects: the TEI Archiving, Publishing, and Access Service (TAPAS), TextGrid – Virtual Research Environment for the Humanities, and DARIAH – Digital Infrastructure for the Arts and Humanites. Panelists will briefly describe the recent work of their organizations, which will serve as background for a more general discussion (involving both panelists and the audience) on the following questions: How could these infrastructural projects collaborate in ways that would benefit the TEI community? How can these organizations stay abreast of changing user needs, and what TEI community needs are not yet being met by existing infrastructure? What tools could be added to make this infrastructure more valuable to users – both discipline-specific and from a more generic perspective? What value would an international TEI repository have for the TEI community, and how might it be used? What are the technical and social challenges involved in developing this kind of infrastructure, and what kinds of long-term support are most appropriate and effective?\nThomas Kollatz is a researcher at the Steinheim Institute for German Jewish History, Essen/Germany.

Style don't really know what that is lol so a 10 on that one. The sound extreme headache i felt like i was gonna die from how repetitive the sounds are 7 on that. Violence not a violent type game so a 10 on that. Interactivity one of the MOST important things for a game.

Also, microbial biomass and enzyme activity were greater in the aerated tea, indicating that the number of microbes and their metabolic activity levels were higher. In follow up experiment the brilliant Buckeyed scientists looked at how aeration affected plant growth. They ran trials on cucumber and tomato plants, some with aerated tea, some without non-aerated tea. The differences were drastic (click the Link Here to see pictures) and a significant effect was seen even at the lowest concentration tested, which was 1 gallon of tea in 20 gallons of water.

Worm castings are packed with nutrients and beneficial microorganisms that are known to improve soil health and plant growth. When water is run through a worm farm, and collected from the outlet, it picks up particles of worm castings and decaying matter. This liquid fertiliser can then be diluted to the colour of weak tea, hence why it is sometimes referred to as “worm tea.” Personally, I like to refer to it as leachate because I think this name more accurately describes the process of extracting it from the worm farm in this way. This substance is what I use on the plants in my garden both edible, native and exotic with very positive results.\nLike any other manure, fertiliser or other decomposing organic material, liquid collected straight from the worm farm can also contain potential pathogens, which are not meant for human consumption. If using this to fertilise your edible plants, I recommend washing them thoroughly before eating. I would always recommend washing any fruits or vegetables before consumption regardless.\nAnother way to create liquid fertiliser from the worm farm is to create a “brew”, which is what some people call worm tea. This process involves collecting finished worm castings from the farm and placing them into a porous sack or bag (an old cotton sock or something similar could do the trick here.) The sack of worm castings is then put into a bucket of water, like a tea bag. An aerator, such as a fish tank bubbler and some molasses is also put into the bucket. The mixture is left to brew and bubble for approximately 24-48 hours. People who brew “worm tea” in this way believe that the beneficial microbes feed on the molasses and thrive in the oxygen rich environment created through the bubbling process. I often talk of compost and worm farm aeration because the presence of oxygen within this environment creates what we call an “aerobic” state. Worms and beneficial microorganisms tend to do very well in an aerobic environment. When a compost or worm farm is not aerated it can become “anaerobic” (lacking in oxygen) and this is when we may see the less desirable organisms become more prevalent.", "score": 0.856714547, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:adff49d1-844f-4af8-a1bd-e684fb77ff20>", "text": "The theory behind brewing tea in this bubbling/molasses way is to tip the balance in the liquid extracted from a worm farm to a more favourable state.

He was pleased with the mild taste and continued to experiment by brewing leaves from various plants.\nOver time, this practice spread around the world, and there are currently many types of teas and a vast number of brands to choose from.\nTea is brewed using leaves, flowers, buds and twigs from a variety of plants. One of the most popular still is the common tea leaf, which comes from the plant Camellia sinensis, a flowering shrub native to China (sinensis means “Chinese” in Latin). Ever since that first “accidental brewing” in the emperor’s cup, scientists have discovered that drinking tea introduces important nutrients and minerals to our systems and has a wide variety of health benefits.\nChamomile tea is sometimes used to help birds that feather pick. Consultant with your avian veterinarian before trying this method.\nAlthough water quality is important for our pet birds and parrots, what birds drink in the wild is far from sterile. Many species of birds visit water sources like tree hollows into which these plant components leach tannins, other compounds and minerals. We have all seen wild birds drinking from what appears to be “dirty” puddles and other water sources. However, many contain a type of “tea” from the leaves that have fallen into the water.\nDifferent types of Camellia teas are commonly used, and they differ according to when the leaves are harvested and their preparation. These plants also differ in their benefits to us and our birds when they are consumed. Teas from the Camellia plant include the popular green and black teas, as well as white tea. Green tea consists of young leaves that are picked and quickly dried to avoid oxidation. Oxidation is simply the leaves absorbing oxygen while drying, which causes biochemical changes to the leaves, similar to fermentation. We’ve all seen oxidation at work when apples turn brown after being sliced.\nBlack teas are oxidized before firing, giving them a more wilted look. On the other hand, white tea is picked before the leaf buds have opened. They are steamed and quickly dried and are also unoxidized.", "score": 0.48440671195661517, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:172aa259-0792-47e5-8a1f-2efd2a18dbfa>", "text": "Creating a nutritious soil amendment from plant matter decomposition is otherwise known as composting.

Our composting focus is mainly on vermicomposting, or worm composting, which creates a nutrient rich product from the worm castings.\nOur compost system has two main steps for soil amendment products. We first chop organic waste and place into a static piles, for an initial decomposition. We then transfer this material into one of our 16 large 4’x4’x3′ worm bins, where the worms will complete our soil processing through vermicomposting.\nWe have 16 worm bins located at our Edmonston Farm filled with Eisenia fetida (commonly known as red wiggler worms) that thrive in decomposing matter. They are the hardest working livestock on our urban farm. Red wriggler worms consume their body-weight in organic matter every single day, and reproduce every 2 to 3 months. These precious animals produce some of the finest soil additives one can find: known as worm castings.\nWe use worm castings throughout our farm, and beyond. The castings are added to our soil to grow our produce, they can be sold as soil amendments to other growers, and they can be used to create a living organic liquid fertilizer known as compost tea.\nWe also create and use biochar on our farm, which is a charcoal used for agricultural purposes. It is highly valued for its ability to stabilize soil PH, lock carbon into the soil and increase water retention and beneficial microbial growth. We love it for all these reasons and more including that trees, brush and pallets from our farm are turned into high value soil amendments as opposed to being hauled away.\nAnother key component of our sustainable farming practice is compost tea. We make compost tea from worm castings as both a form of organic liquid fertilizer and pest and disease management tool.

The worms now live in the spare room at Leigh's house and have been thriving for many months. They have devoured untold pounds of organic waste, created buckets of great compost which have gone into my backyard garden, and have produced enough offspring that I have divided them up twice to create my own worm bin and one for my mom.

Numerous pre-made worm bins are commercially available to get your vermiculture setup up and running in a hurry, but you could just as easily make your own. An opaque, dark-colored flexible plastic storage tub or bin with a lid makes a great worm bin once holes are drilled for drainage and aeration. Look for a container that holds 10 to 18 gallons. A depth of 10 to 20 inches is ideal for a bin that's 12 inches wide, 24 inches long. Exact dimensions don't matter, but the goal is a manageable size that's not too heavy, unwieldy or too deep.\nKeep the storage location in mind as well; a good place for the bin is in a garage, under a deck, under the kitchen sink, in the basement or in a shaded area outdoors. A bin with built-in handles is also a great idea, should you ever choose to move the worm bin. While you could make the bin out an old dresser drawer or from wood scraps, a plastic bin is best for a first bin, as you learn about caring for the worms and creating the perfect worm environment.\nTo turn a plastic storage tub into a worm-composting bin, drill a series of 1/8-inch holes near the top perimeter of the bin or tub, below the line where the lid locks in place. One hole every 3 to 4 inches all the way around will suffice. Note: Do not drill holes in the lid, as this could allow too much light in, which would be detrimental to the worms. Drill five or six 1/4-inch holes in the bottom of the tub, equally spaced, for drainage. You'll also need a second lid, perhaps one from a larger tub, or a separate larger, shallow bin to hold the first bin. This second bin catches liquid runoff, sometimes called worm tea or compost tea, which is full of nutrients that benefit soil.\nSetting Up the Worm Bin\nYour new worm bin must be set up with everything the worms need to both survive and thrive, much like preparing a home for a new puppy.

Earthworms, such as the night crawler, are burrowing worms that live deeper in the earth. They are not composting worms.\nCreating the Correct Environment for Eisenia fetida\nSuccessful vermicomposting requires a worm bin that provides the appropriate environmental conditions for worms. Worms breathe through their skin and require an environment that is moist, but not so wet that they drown. The material in which they live should feel like a damp sponge and release a few drops of water when squeezed.\nVarious worm species have different temperature requirements. Eisenia fetida, the one recommended for a composting worm bin, can survive at temperatures between 35° and 100°F but performs best between 65°and 78°F.\nWorms do not have eyes, but they do have light receptors on their skin. They do not like light, and will quickly dig down into a bin to avoid it. For this reason, it is a good idea to provide a cover for your worm bin.\nBuilding a Worm Bin\nYou can purchase a worm bin or you can build your own. Two things to consider when selecting a bin design are the amount of food scraps you generate and where the bin will be located. Amount of food scraps will determine the size bin you need, and location will determine whether or not the bin needs to be insulated.\nA good rule of thumb for sizing a worm bin is this: you can process one-half pound of food scraps per day for each square foot of worm bin surface area. For example, a bin that is 18 inches by 24 inches (18/12 x 24/12) is 3 square feet in surface area and can process about 10.5 pounds of food a week (3 sq ft x 1/2 lb/ft sq/day x 7 days/week = 10.5 lbs).\nWorms can survive over a wide range of temperatures, but temperatures below freezing or above 100°F can kill them. If your worm bin will be in a location where the temperature is moderated such as a garage, mudroom, basement, pantry, or under a sink, then you do not need to worry about insulating it.", "score": 0.0008889848082565679, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:6d506aac-ca86-4580-9884-f469e3fd503d>", "text": "Egyptian hieroglyphics was one of the language systems used by the ancient Egyptians.

At first the Egyptians called the writing system \"pictures;\" later it was elevated to mean, \"writing of God's words.\"\nHieroglyphs are a mixture of picture symbols (ideograms) as well as phonetic characters (phonograms), and were used in a way different from alphabetic writing. The hieroglyphic system is best described as \"rebus\" writing, in which words could be made up of one single hieroglyph or a combination of several hieroglyphs.\nHieroglyphs were pictures, though some pictures are hard to understand. They were written according to the following principles:\n1. A hieroglyph as a picture, f.x. in which a picture represents a \"sun\".\n2.

Featuring both hieroglyphs and demotic (as well as Greek), the stone depicts two stages in Egypt’s written and spoken history. The Ancient Egyptian language, which differs markedly from today’s Egyptian Arabic, went through 5 stages. These were; Old Egyptian, Middle Egyptian, Late Egyptian, Demotic and Coptic. Appearing suddenly in 3000 BC, hieroglyphs emerged as a full system, unlike other symbolic languages which developed over time.\nThe term ‘hieroglyph’ derives from a combination of two Greek words ιερός (hieros) and γλύφω (glypho) and essentially translates as ‘sacred carvings’. The Egyptians themselves referred to their own language as ‘divine speech’. Hieroglyphic, as a whole system and as we know it today, is nothing more than simply the way the Ancient Egyptians recorded their language.\nHieroglyphs are split into three different groupings, depending on their use.\nThese are; ideograms, phonograms and determinatives (Middle Egyptian onwards).\nThe Three Groupings of Hieroglyphs\nIdeograms are signs that represent the things they actually represent. For example, the symbol for a mouth is, transliterated as ‘r’. The sign looks very much like a stylised mouth.\nUsed in Middle Egyptian onwards, determinatives are signs placed at the end of a word to express that the symbols preceding it are phonograms. They usually indicate the general idea of the word.\nAre signs that represent the sound they make. English, for example is made up fundamentally from phonograms, each sound of a word represented by a letter or combination of letters. The idea that symbols could represent sounds, rather than simply stand for the item they wished to represent, is known as the Rebus principle. It is a fundamental theory in the development of languages.\nTake, for example, the adjective ‘I believe’. Using the Rebus principle, you would represent in images the sounds of each syllable.", "score": 0.840616167, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:3f3ff996-ee22-4aab-905b-93cb24a2deb3>", "text": "It is a very old form of writing that they starting using as early as B. These variants were also more suited than hieroglyphs for use on papyrus. Hieroglyphs representing two consonants Hieroglyphs representing three consonants Determinatives Determinatives are non-phonetic glyphs which give extra information about the meanings of words, distinguish homophones and serve as word dividers. In this same way, the ancient Egyptians would be able to read hieroglyphic script by recognizing what 'letters' were missing in a sentence and applying them. In modern transcriptions, an e is added between consonants to aid in their pronunciation. To stop using many of these signs and to change the entire system of writing would have been considered both a sacrilege and an immense loss, not to mention the fact that such a change would make all the older texts meaningless at a single blow. A single picture symbol could stand for a whole word, called an ideogram, or a sound, called a phonogram. For example, the glyph for crocodile is a picture of a crocodile and also represents the sound \"msh\". This does not reflect Egyptian vowels, which are obscure, but is merely a modern convention.\nAs the stone presented a hieroglyphic and a demotic version of the same text in parallel with a Greek translation, plenty of material for falsifiable studies in translation was suddenly available.\nOther decipherment attempts were made in the 9th and 10th by Arab historians Dhul-Nun al-Misri and Ibn Wahshiyya, and in the 17th century by Athanasius Kircher.

In the scrolls we have available to modern study addition and subtraction are regarded as so simple as to not need to show any working out which is unfortunate as this means we don’t actually know how they did it, you just get the required sum and then the answer. However everything beyond that is included and it should be understood that the ancient Egyptians managed their entire means of calculation by merely being able to multiply and divide by two and for reasons that are too complex to go into in this blog they also had the 2/3 times table (usually written down rather than memorised) and used this so extensively that when they needed to find a third of a number they would first get two thirds of it and then halve the answer.\nSo how did they multiply? Well the example given in the book is for multiplying 7 by 13 and this was done as follows. Start by writing two columns, the first of which has a 1 in it and the second has one of the numbers to be multiplied (this is the second example in the book as I think it is better to understand than the first). Under each number double the figure above until doing so in the column starting with one you would have a number larger than the number you are trying to multiply.\nSimply adding up the values opposite the checked values in the first column gives the answer to 7 x 13 which is 91. If the number in the first column isn’t needed to sum to 13 in this case then you simply ignore the corresponding number in the second column. It’s simple really. Division is done the same way but a scribe asked to divide 184 by 8 would instead ask himself how many times do I need to multiply 8 to get to 184 so would create a similar chart to the one above.", "score": 0.837651491, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:9101bf70-2972-46e7-be32-33d061b7118e>", "text": "From A to Sh, the hieroglyphic symbols are:\nA an Egyptian vulture\nB a foot\nC a basket with handle\nD a hand\nE a reed\nF a horned viper (an Egyptian snake)\nG a jar-stand\nH a reed shelter\nI a reed\nJ a cobra\nK the basket with the handle again (because hard 'C' is like 'K')\nL a lion\nM an owl\nN a zigzag symbol for water\nO a lasso\nP a square stool\nQ a symbol for the slope of a hill\nR a mouth\nS a piece of linen folded over\nT a bun\nU a quail chick (which stands for the sound 'U')\nV a horned viper\nW a quail chick\nX a basket and folded linen\nY two reeds\nZ a door bolt\nCH a hobble\nKH a ball of string\nSH the rectangle (which is the symbol for land)\nWhy don't you use the hieroglyphic chart above to see if you can write your own name?\nFor more about the Ancient Egyptians and their hieroglyphics, check out this cool clip...\nBe sure to read our other fab features about Ancient Egypt, too!", "score": 0.837186277, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:ed856cc3-9cea-4865-85a4-7203cfb9c175>", "text": "Egyptian scribes had used a system of 24 or 25 unique phonetic symbols (all consonants) to record foreign proper names, but never replaced hieroglyphic pictographs.6 Because many of the earliest alphabetical inscriptions by Semitic tribes were found in copper mines in the Sinai, many scholars propose that these uneducated Semitic workers borrowed the idea of alphabetic script from Egyptian phonetic symbols, which were far simpler than hieroglyphs themselves.7\nThe Phoenician and Aramaic alphabets developed from this Proto-Sinaitic writing system. By the 8th century BCE, the Greeks had adopted the alphabet from the Phoenicians. Because vowels were more phonetically significant in Greek than in Phoenician, the meaning of five unused consonantal signs shifted to represent five of these vowel-sounds.8 The Greek alphabet was therefore the first to graphically represent both consonantal and vowel sounds, and thus this often considered the first true alphabet.\nRoman writing developed from a mixture of Etruscan and western Greek alphabets around the 5th century BCE. By the 3rd century BCE, this alphabet comprised 21 of the 26 letters we currently use. The last five letters, j, u, w, y, and z, were added over the following centuries. The modern English alphabet was not fixed until the advent large-scale publishing in the 19th century.9 [image: alphabetevolution.jpg]\nThe alphabet was derived from earlier, non-phonetic graphic systems. According to I.J. Gelb in A Study of Writing there were three ways in which the first logograms (in scripts like Sumerian and Egyptian Hieroglyphics) created meaning. The first type of logogram suggests a concrete object or action simply by means of a visual resemblance. The second operates through association. That is, a picture of a circle with lines radiating outward might not only mean ‘sun’, but also ‘bright’ or ‘day’. A third class of signs represented concepts with geometric forms (such as marks for documenting numerical value).10\nThe development that bridged non-phonetic to phonetic writing systems was the rebus. A rebus is a graphic sign whose meaning has shifted from the word depicted by the original pictograph to a word or word-part that is phonetically similar to that original word.", "score": 0.836913228, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:8e01a240-c789-4f2c-9185-bf60ba071e42>", "text": "Skip to 0 minutes and 0 secondsSymbols!

Roman numbers are difficult to parse, and their length varies at lot. The mystery sequence in my previous post was just that: the length of roman numeral n for each value of n. The question I was wondering is: how inefficient is the roman numeral system? The decimal basically needs log10(n) symbols to represent number n, the same number in binary format will need log2(n). My intuition would be that the roman system is less efficient (in terms of symbols needed to represent a value) than the decimal system, but better than the binary representation.\nSo I wrote a small program to compute how many chars would be needed to represent a given number.\nThe graph shows the various number system, each point is the mean number of characters needed to represent the values in the range [2i … 2i+1[. Obviously the binary representation is exactly linear. The decimal notation is also linear, with steps each time a power of 10 is crossed. The roman notation is also linear up to 218 where the curves goes up: the reason is simple, there is no symbol for values above 10000 (ↈ). Up until that point roman numeral seem to be as efficient as a ternary notation.\nTo generate those numbers, I created a small python script to generate roman numerals. For the sake of consistency, I chose to only generate characters from the unicode roman numeral range (\nx2188). One interesting thing in this range is that it contains hybrid characters, like Ⅷ (\nx2167) which represent the roman numeral for eight in one single character. Using that range we get slightly different curve, the asymptotic behaviour is not changed, but numbers are generally shorter by two characters and for small numbers, the system is now as efficient as arabic numerals.\nHere is the python script that generates the shorter roman numerals using the hybrid characters.", "score": 0.01436310588446103, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:eadb9aa0-9337-47db-9e47-cc5f3f0c8113>", "text": "“The beauty of the colouring of these intaglios no one can describe,” observed Florence Nightingale on her visit to the richly decorated tomb of Seti i in 1850. “How anyone who has time and liberty, and has once begun the study of hieroglyphics, can leave it til he has made out every symbol … I cannot conceive.”\nHistorians and philosophers of the Classical Era were among the first to take up the challenge, including first-century-bce\nhistorian Diodorus Siculus. According to Maurice Pope, author of The Story of Decipherment: From Egyptian Hieroglyphic to Linear B\n, Diodorus was among the first “to suggest the ideographic nature of the hieroglyphs.” Diodorus’s supposition that hieroglyphs do “not work by putting syllables together … but by drawing objects whose metaphorical meaning is impressed in the memory” was also suggested four centuries later by Egyptian-born Roman philosopher Plotinus, who marveled especially at the creativity and efficiency of Egyptian scribes:\n[T]he wise men of Egypt … did not go through the whole business of letters, words, and sentences. Instead, in their sacred writings they drew signs, a separate sign for each idea, so as to express its whole meaning at once.\nBy this time, there were fewer and fewer native-born Egyptians who could read the hieroglyphs. As Egypt became increasingly Romanized after the fall of Cleopatra in the first century bce, hieroglyphs were gradually replaced by the Roman alphabet.\nStill, what Plotinus and his classical predecessors did not grasp was that hieroglyphics are more than simple ideograms, that is, pictures representing concepts or ideas, much as a circle with a red bar across a smoldering cigarette indicates “No Smoking.” Rather, they build their meanings off three elements: logograms, representing words; phonograms, representing sounds or groups of sounds; and determinatives, marks or images placed at the end of a word to clarify its meaning.\nThe key to Champollion’s understanding was his knowledge of Coptic, which is the linguistic descendent of the spoken Egyptian of the pharaonic era. Coptic uses Greek letters together with a handful of colloquial, or demotic, characters.
