According to geneticist Dr. Virginia Papaioannou in an interview with The New Republic, they could just have coincidental color patterns.\nEither way, we think they’re adorable!\nVenus may be the first well-known chimera cat. She has a striking two-colored face with orange on the left and black on the right.\nShe also has heterochromia with one blue eye and one green.\nVenus has a large following on Instagram and her Facebook page. She also has her own merchandise, including a stuffed animal version of herself and a calendar. She even made an appearance on ABC’s Good Morning America.\nNarnia is a gorgeous British Shorthair bred and owned by Stéphanie Jimenez of the Grace Cattery in France. His body is black, but half of his face is blue (cat talk for a color that’s more like slate gray), and the other half is black. Both of his eyes are blue.\nQuimera is, interestingly, almost the mirror image of Venus. Her face has black on the left and orange on the right. She also has one green eye and one blue. See Quimera on Instagram, or check out this story about her at People.com.\nYana is another tortoiseshell cat with features of a chimera. She is owned by a woman named Elizabeth from Belarus, who found her through a classified ad when she was just a kitten. Yana also has the split facial coloring, but unlike Venus and Quimera, her eyes are both green. You can visit with Yana as a kitten on her Instagram page.\nHow Common Are Chimera Cats?\nChimeras with the dramatic facial features we see in Venus and Narnia are very rare. But chimerism may be much more common than we’d think. A cat could have more than one set of DNA, but sometimes the parts of the body that are affected aren’t visible.\nFor example, some chimeras are born with two blood types mixed in their veins.", "score": 0.836912572, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:f053b1ad-b4c2-4fd4-82e0-3b3911b2a232>", "text": "Most of these cats are females, but once in a great while a male will be born. Chances are good that that male will be a chimera.\nThis happens because of the XX sex chromosomes that females carry and the XY of the males. The mother and the father each pass one chromosome on to the offspring.\nLike humans, the mother cat can only contribute an X, but the father can pass an X or a Y. If he contributes the X, the offspring will be XX, or female. If he contributes the Y, the offspring will be XY, or male.\nThe gene for calico and tortoiseshell coats is only carried on the X chromosome, so dad’s Y can’t produce a calico or tortie. Therefore, nearly all cats with these color patterns are female (X from mom and X from dad equals XX, or female).\nOnce in a while, an embryo fusion will take place. If one of the fused embryos were female and one was male, that cat could be male. That male is more than likely to be a chimera (but again, not always).\nUnfortunately, male torties and calicos will remain rare because most of them are sterile.\nHow Do I Know if My Cat’s a Chimera?\nThe differences caused by chimerism can be subtle, so your cat could be a chimera even if it’s not obvious. On the other hand, a calico or tortoiseshell’s natural coat pattern may look like a chimera’s when it’s not. The only way to know for sure is to have your cat DNA tested.\nWill A Chimera Cat Have Chimera Kittens?\nChimerism can be hereditary, according to Healthline. Depending on which parts of the mother’s body the second set of DNA affects, it is possible for a mother to pass two sets of DNA to the kittens, resulting in a chimera.\nBut this is impossible to predict. Even if you DNA tested the mother, there is no way to know which traits she will pass on to her kittens or which they will inherit from their father.\nChimera Cat Traits and Personality\nBecause chimerism is not a breed but a genetic phenomenon that can happen to any cat, there is no one personality type and no standard traits.

These are names often used to describe a chimera, and there are some pretty famous ones out there. If you haven’t heard of these chimera cats yet, read on to meet them!\nWhat is a Chimera Cat?\nThe simplest explanation is that a chimera cat is one that has one color scheme on half of its face and/or body and another on the other half. The line that separates them is sometimes uncannily straight, making the face look like Mother Nature was having a little joke—trying to blend two cats into one.\nWhich is actually not far from the truth.\nIf you’re familiar with the chimera of Greek mythology, you would be forgiven for thinking the chimera is a magical cat. The chimera from Homer’s Iliad was a fire-breathing monster that had the head of a lion, the body of a goat, and the tale of a serpent.\nBut the feline chimera is a much more down-to-earth creature with a logical scientific explanation.\nWhat Causes the Chimera Phenomenon?\nA chimera cat is one cat that started out as two. Chimera cats have two sets of DNA because a pair of embryos fused together early in the mother’s womb. So, chimera kittens are born with their own individual DNA, plus the DNA from a second embryo. (Some like to say that a chimera is its own identical twin.)\nThe newborn kittens can be born with coloration differences so slight that it’s not really noticeable or with differences that can’t be seen. Occasionally, though, one will show a difference that’s so dramatic that it’s startling.\nWhy Do Some Chimera Cats Have Different-Colored Eyes?\nChimeras will often have eyes that don’t match. This can be the most noticeable feature of some chimeras. It’s a phenomenon called heterochromia.\nMost cats with “odd eyes,” as it’s often called, are not chimeras, But it is more likely to happen with chimeras because of the two sets of DNA these cats have. They get one color from their own DNA and another from the second set.\nAre Calicos and Tortoiseshells Chimera Cats?\nCalicos and tortoiseshell cats often look like chimeras, but most are not.", "score": 0.827846229, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:86481d08-b323-4eb4-8f11-676a78d53a60>", "text": "How do you tell if your cat has a fever?

The R1 129 ES cells we use are heterozygous at albino locus, carrying one copy of chinchilla allele of albino (cch, also designated Tyrc-ch) and are heterozygous at the pink-eyed dilution locus (p). Breeding offspring descended from R1 ES cells to each other can give rise to mice which are black, different shades of gray, different shades of brown, or yellow, depending on the assortment of coat color alleles.\nWhat can be done to ensure germline transmission?\nGermline transmission is maximized with ES cells\nthat have spent a minimum amount of time in culture, that have a normal complement of chromosomes, and that are free of yeast, bacteria and mycoplasma. Target a cell line that you know is transmitted under your conditions at your institution. Use a parental cell line that is at the lowest passage number available (preferably less than passage number 16). Minimize the time that the targeted line is cultured. Verify that targeted cell lines have the normal number\nof chromosomes. Test your cell line for mycoplasma. Some cell lines will not transmit even when all these parameters are in your favor. Even under optimal conditions, only two-thirds of targeted ES cell lines will be transmitted through the germ line. Therefore, start with at least three independent targeted cell lines to ensure transmission.\nI have weak chimeras/female chimeras. Will they transmit the knockout?\nBoth weak chimeras and female chimeras can transmit mutant alleles, although infrequently. Male chimeras which are likely to transmit the targeted mutation can be identified by copulatory plug genotyping. Only about 10% of female chimeras transmit the ES cell genome, when they do so it is only in the first few litters, and many of their male offspring have sex chromosome aneuploidies which render them infertile (Bronson et al., 1995 PNAS 92, 3120 [.pdf]).\nWhy did my strongest chimeras die?\nMortality can increase with the proportion of the animal that comes from ES cells, even for the best cell lines.", "score": 0.81926018, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:42eb106c-3e66-44e0-9c9e-2f5e2fd133fd>", "text": "Check dog cat symptoms online | web dvm, My 5 year old pomeranian has had 3 episodes in the past 3 days, which consists of her being completely normal and then she gets a scared look in her eyes..

Obviously, chimeras have only one face. But occasionally a cat will be born with two actual faces.\nThese are the real two-faced cats, and they’re called Janus cats. They’re named for the Roman god Janus, who was said to have two faces so he could see back into the past and forward into the future.\nJanus cats are extremely rare and very few live beyond a few days. But some beat the odds. This CNN video features two Janus cats. One is a just-born kitten, and the other is the longest surviving Janus cat, named Frank and Louie.\nFrank and Louie (whom the media cruelly nicknamed Frankenlouie) made it into the Guinness Book of World Records when he was 12 for the longest-surviving Janus cat. He was 14 years old at the time of this video.\nWhere Can I Find a Chimera Kitten for Sale?\nThe short answer is that you probably can’t. Again, because chimeras aren’t a breed but only a genetic variation, you can’t just shop for one.\nUnfortunately, there is no such thing as a chimera cat breeder. You can visit shelters and rescues and watch classified ads, and one day you might get lucky. (After all, Elizabeth found Yana through a classified ad!)\nBut finding a true chimera cat (or even a cat that looks like one) is probably less likely than finding a four-leaf clover in your backyard.\nIf you did get lucky and find one, it would be impossible to predict a chimera cat price. Because of their rarity, even if you were to find someone willing to part with one, if they knew the value of what they had, the price would probably be high.\nCan Humans Be Chimeras?\nYes!

In your 60’s, that librarian isn’t as quick as she used to be; she’s wearing orthopedic shoes, rolled down hosiery and walking with a slight limp from her arthritis.

After she has had her own red experience, she does know what John’s experience upon looking at ripe apples is like. Thus, there is some fact – the fact that John’s experience had this definite character – that she did not know before her release, but that she does know afterward. But she knew all the physical facts before her release. Thus, there is a fact that is not a physical fact. And since this fact is the fact that John’s experience has a certain quale, such facts about qualia are not physical facts.\nWe will refine this argument below. For the present, let us note that its conclusion has been mightily resisted. Among the most cited attempts to avoid Jackson’s conclusion is that of Lewis (1983, 1990) and Nemirow (1980, 1990), who hold that Mary acquires some new abilities but no knowledge of new facts. Thus, after her release, Mary is able to imagine John’s state or remember what it was without calculation of his neural state; but the state she knows is the same one that she once could only reach by calculation. In contrast, qualophiles do not deny that Mary acquires some new abilities, but they doubt that these can adequately be described without reference to her knowledge of new facts. For example, post-release Mary can indeed imagine John’s state, but what she can then imagine is how things look to John, namely red; and whereas before her release she could have known that \"red\" is the right word for how things look to John, she would not have known what she now knows, namely, what looking red consists in.\nJackson has recently disavowed the success of the knowledge argument, citing the following maxim: \"do not have opinions that outrun what is required by the best theory of these opinions’ causal origins\" (Jackson, 1998, p. 77). Since Jackson also assumes that Mary’s coming to know what it is like to see red has physical causes, he concludes that what she learns should not outrun \"how things are physically\".", "score": 0.814079642, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:5d18d46a-194f-4ac3-8a3d-eb7b5793d5bc>", "text": "= Long ago I heard (fourth or remote past, beyond a year ago).\n- There are at least ten more tenses, including perfect versions of the above, as well as future, indefinite, and pluperfect.\n- Mood.

But Yamamura creates harmony out of a craft vocabulary that is simultaneously contemporary and Western and traditional and Japanese. His mystically beautiful urushi takes the ancient Japanese tradition of urushi into the 21st-century.\nUrushi, Japanese wood lacquer, dates back 9,000 years to the Jomon period. The lacquer is from the sap of the Japanese Rhus Vernicifera three. The lacquer technique is commonly used to finish wooden and earthen vessels. Lacquer also serves as a strong adhesive when it is wet, and artisans can apply either maki-e (gold powder); chinkin (gold foil) or raden (mother of pearl inlays) to create decorative designs of flowers and animals. Other traditional materials include eggshell and abalone.\nYamamura, who has a strong following in the United States (his pieces have been collected by Florence and Herbert Irving, and will be part of the Asian lacquer collection at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art) became interested in urushi when he was still a graduate student in industrial design. While attending an arts and crafts exhibit, he discovered a jet black lacquered box with a delicate eggshell inlay of a white heron— which turned out to be the catalyst of his attraction to lacquered work.\nHis fascination led him to Kanazawa, known worldwide for its handicrafts, to study and master the art of urushi. Between his traditional studies, and his perusal of American crafts magazines, Yamamura began to shape his signature style. He says, \"I found so many ideas through these magazines, and I thought that they were so fresh and exciting. I guess I was inspired a lot from American culture.\"\nAfter learning the basic process—which has at least fifty painting and lacquering stages—Yamamura learned to push the boundaries of urushi, to take tradition and layer upon it his own personal style. The process he has invented for himself is an arduous one that involves more than one hundred steps to achieve a finished piece. He starts with a prototype, and from there he moves onto making the container from Hinoki cypress. Multiple steps of sanding, grinding, painting follow – culminating in the addition of numerous materials to decorate the wet lacquered surface.", "score": 0.803583, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:bca08086-3077-4f86-8777-c2fa976c6557>", "text": "Today’s appliances and devices consist of an assembly of integrated electrical and mechanical components.

The idea is to teach our demographic — the younger generation who’s immersed in fashion — about architecture through our travels.\nThe brand believes that fashion and architecture, at their core, are focused on assembly. The architectural system and technique of “fastening” connects forms or materials in a variety of ways, where sequence is of utmost importance.\nFashion’s construction of clothing through pattern making and sewing follows a similar type of protocol.\nBoth fields utilize, as a base language, innovation, experimentation and fluency with color and texture. In this way, architecture follows fashion.\nThis way fashion’s advances in fabric manipulation — like digital laser cutting or the use of a 3-D printer — can translate directly into architectural techniques used to define a building’s structural surfaces.\n“Behaviors of fabrics can be extracted and implemented to work on architectural membranes.”\nOn a more aesthetic level, fashion designers have also crossed over to interior design.\nFashion no longer associated with an eponymous clothing line, recently designers are collaborating with high-end furniture companies.\nFashion gets inspiration from all sources. However, the synergy between fashion designers and architects is unparalleled. Architecture produces inhabitable art while fashion gives us wearable art.\nDesigners who dip their toe into the world of architectural fashion, use building blocks to form the garment. In the same manner that architects use concrete, glass, bricks etc to construct the building, designers make high fashion dresses.\nLà Fuori’s dressmaking is the architecture of movement” while incorporating architectural elements into his design.\nOur brand it investigates the commonalities between architecture and fashion – to create shelter. While architecture creates shelter for one or more human bodies, fashion shelters one (most of the time). Both, however, focus on placing aesthetic as a common factor in the design of their product. This segregates them from the rest of the sciences and brings them into the realm of fine arts.\nThe inspiration from art can easily be witnessed in the designs that stand out and draw our attention to its artistic roots. Nature plays a vital role in this scenario. When the resulting garment/building comes out of an exploration of natural forms, the result is almost always original.

A few kilometers south of Beirut, Houssam Outabashi is found in Ouzai with multiple workshops lining the street. Here, Outabashi, a master in traditional marquetry and inlay techniques, can look at a piece of mother of pearl and name its country of origin by its color. Marquetry is a process by which small pieces of different types of wood are bundled to form a pattern, and then shaved in thin layers, while inlay design is a process in which chunks of wood are carved out and replaced with the shimmery pieces cut from sheets of Mother of Pearl to create intricate designs.\nOutabashi specializes in the traditional styles of his craft, however, he has started modernizing some of his designs. L’artisan du Liban has provided him with support to help preserve his craft, which goes back as far as the 1800s through generations of his family. Nour Najm, creative director of L’artisan du Liban, says they work with Outabashi, designing objects that Outabashi creates by hand and then are sold in L’artisan du Liban store.\nFurther south in Sarafand, L’artisan similarly works with the Khalifeh family who create glassware out of recycled glass—which in a country that has an excess of garbage, is remarkable. The Khalifeh’s only turn on the oven five to six times a year, but can turn it on up to 10 times when there is an order to be filled—otherwise it is a resource drain. When it is on, six to eight people work in shifts around the clock for 15-20 days to fill an order. Najm says L’artisan makes sure to place a large order with the Khalifeh’s each time they turn on the oven.\nIn the small, run-down warehouse where the Khalifeh family makes their glass, Najm is thinking about what she can do to give the glassware a modern twist—for her, the answer is color.

After World War II, when the Japanese economy was rapidly growing, mechanization increased drastically, and this increased the efficiency of production. This surely affected the stone crafts as well.

The pressing need for increased productivity as well as for the delivery od products of uniform high quality is turining industry more towards computer-based automation. As a synergy of core technologies of mechanical engeneering, electronics, computer science, indstrumentation and controls, mechatronics is fast becoming an important component of modern products and processes that are highly integrated in functionalities. New concurrent engenering thinking framework in the process of designing machines, mechatronics is indeed bringing about an industrial paradigm shift. Mechatronics, with its multidiciplinary integrated approach to product dessign is poised to become thekey enabling technology for gaining a competitive edge in the modern manufacturing era. The development of mechatronics is therefore crucial to competitivness of Kosovo economy.\nMechatronics and Management has recieved comparatively little attention from engineering education researchers. For some years concerns have arisen about how best to prepare under-graduate engineers to work with advanced technologies in organisational contexts. Academicians and engeneering managers have identified several key areas for endeneering and technology educators to focus on. Failure of advanced technology projects has often been attributed to non-technical rather than technical problems. Research has postulated that the poor treatment of non-technical issues within advanced engeneering programmes has contributed to systems failure, as those charged with designing, developing and implementing the technologies have not been provided with necessary set of skills and knowledge needed to manage non-technical issues. As a result, high profile professional bodies have called for a greater balance between technical and non-technical competencies of technologists (Just IT & Recruitment, JP Morgan, Gsachs International).\nConventional Engeneering education throughout Europe has been dominated by technical subjects and had little to offer in terms of interdisciplinary academic training. Topics related to economics, business management and legal ethic of the profession have recieved little attention or have been addressed through short-term courses. On the other hand, graduates of business fields have rarely had the chance to get an indepth knowledge of technical fields while mostly releying on on-the job trainings to complement their missing link.", "score": 0.33150484737057573, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:231b0956-0d48-4e84-8d74-c87ea512ffee>", "text": "I know, they fly by yor majic.

What is your view of the situation?\nStratmann: We are aware of the fact that scientists, who conduct animal experiments, are subjected to particular pressure. They therefore deserve full support from the MPG. There has been a comprehensive range of support measures for the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in Tübingen. The MPG has, for example, provided the Director with an acclaimed and internationally experienced crisis manager, who supported for several months. There has also been staff support from the Administrative Headquarters, as well as thorough legal consultation and further HR and financial measures. For example, we have arranged for additional expert staff to be hired at the Institute. Among those staff members are an animal facility manager, an Animal Welfare Officer and a PR advisor. To discontinue experiments with non-human primates entirely, and to limit research to work with rodents, was a decision that Mr. Logothetis made by himself in April 2015. We found this very regrettable.\nduz: Why are animal experiments with non-human primates so important?\nStratmann: This type of research has great potential for biomedical concepts. Vaccine research or the development of new effective antibiotics, for example against multi-resistant germs, will not be able to manage without modern primate research and genetically modified non-human primates. The history and the success of HIV research are textbook examples of this. However, research with non-human primates is decreasing in Germany and in Europe. This may in part be due to the critical mindset of the population. Outside of Europe, this type of research is meanwhile increasing. Research work with genetically modified non-human primates is already taking place, especially in Japan and in China. One reason for this is the realization that mice and rats are not always suitable as models for studying the brain, and in particular higher cognitive processes and psychiatric disorders.\n“This is why we must ensure that confidence in us is never called into doubt”\nduz: Logothetis felt pressured by the MPG to resign from his position or to leave, in order to avert harm to the MPG.

Whether it is a strawberry jar, a hanging basket, or a planter, use a container with good drainageeither several drainage holes at the bottom of the container or multiple holes throughout the container, as with a strawberry pot. Avoid areas prone to frost and soils that have previously grown potatoes, chrysanthemums, or tomatoes because they are all prone to the disease verticillium wilt. Strawberries are traditionally grown in rows directly into garden soil. Keep the soil moist and grow in cooler locations. Grey mould ( botrytis) is a common disease especially in damp or humid conditions. Strawberries grow easily in containers as small as 10-12 inches in diameter Begin with seeds, or certified disease-free plants Leave enough room for the roots to spread throughout the soil Clay and metal pots will conduct more heat whereas synthetic and light-colored pots keep roots nice and cool in … The best position for strawberry plants growing in containers is in full sunlight, but sheltered from the prevailing winds. Hydro towers can use either soil or a soilless medium to grow strawberries. If you are already growing perennial plants in 3-liter pressed fit pots, you can grow really nice strawberries in the same system. The crops are not so heavy as the summer-fruiting ones and the fruits are smaller, with the plants less likely to produce runners.

Dry media will act like a sponge and suck all moisture from plants roots.\nCarefully place one strawberry plant in the pot with roots splayed over the media. Add enough of the growing medium to fill the pot making sure the crown of the strawberry is well above the surface. The crown requires light and fresh air as this is where new leaves and flowers grow. If submerged, the crown will rot causing the entire plant to die.\nInsert the pot into your hydroponic garden and follow the instructions. Make sure plants receive a good water-to-air ratio and that roots are never left standing in still water or solution. A feeding regime with a standard 2-part bloom nutrient formula should provide all the nourishment that your strawberry plants will require to grow robust and flavourful berries. pH should be maintained between 5.8 and 6.2 to ensure maximum nutrient uptake.\nThere are several different types of strawberries suitable to various climates and zones. The long-day-type typically grown in northern regions are light and climate sensitive. Flower and fruit production is triggered by the long hours of spring and early summer light received by the plant. Once introduced to a warm climate, plants will continuously produce an abundance of flowers. Temperature also affects fruit’s flavour and sugar content.\nConditions can easily be simulated indoors, out-of-season. Once plants have finished fruiting and produced runners, clip the runners from the mother plant and root using conventional rooting methods. Treat mother plants as annuals as they will not winter well in a hydroponic garden.\nOnce cuttings or runners have established a good root system, they must endure a chilling process. This may be done by placing rooted cuttings in a garage or cold cellar where temperatures remain between 0 and 5 deg C. Chilling may last anywhere from 10 days to 5 months depending on when your next crop is desired.\nIntroducing the chilled cuttings to a growing environment at staggered times will yield a delicious supply of fresh berries year round.\n© Copyright 2013 Homegrown Hydroponics, Inc.

The planting hole should be wide enough so that you can spread the roots out. Then filter the soil down in and around the roots. When you finish planting, water the plants to work the soil down into the root area and get rid of any air pockets. Then it's a good idea to check the crowns of the plants to make sure the soil hasn't exposed the root tops. If it has, work in soil around the roots and under the crown. For season long watering, a dripper hose is a better way to deliver water at the roots. Strawberry plants should be kept well watered.\nYou can allow runners to root the second year.

When selecting your substrate for tunnel cultivation, it’s important to keep an eye on the airiness and permeability of the blend.\nAiriness and structure in substrates\nTo reach the right air content and permeability it’s important to use materials that offer some coarseness to the mixture. In addition, when using mechanical planters, it’s relevant to make sure that the substrates are compatible with the machines.\nKekkilä Professional’s Fruit and Berry Mix (FBM) product portfolio is composed to match all the important criteria of modern strawberry and raspberry cultivation.\nThe FBM substrates contain high-quality raw materials like peat, moss, cotton grass, wood fibre, and perlite. Due to their high water retention, peat-based mixtures are rather forgiving when it comes to minor irrigation errors and problems. Even if something goes wrong within your irrigation cycle your soft fruit plants will still have access to some moisture, so they will not wither immediately, endangering your yield.\nIrrigation of peat-based media during the growing season\nIn the early stages of cultivation, special attention should be paid to the amount of water used for irrigation. When using Kekkilä Professional’s FBM product line, or other peat-based growing media, we’d advise growers to start off with smaller, frequent irrigations. That way the substrate has time to absorb the water and build up a moisture buffer. Complimentary raw materials like moss make it easier for growers to wet the substrate evenly and quickly.\nAt the start of cultivation, the root development might be slow. It can be especially slow on the top of the pot, with bare-root plants. Water is mainly absorbed by the youngest tips of the roots. The roots need oxygen to be able to absorb water. The plant finds the oxygen within the pores between the particles within the substrate mixture. As the root system grows and the root mass increases, the need for water rises as well. This makes it even more important to use a structurally stable substrate that doesn’t compact.\nIt’s also important to keep an eye on the temperature levels in the tunnels, as the temperature of the growing medium may affect the water uptake. In spring cultivation for example the core temperature of the substrate can drop a lot during cool nights.", "score": 0.849638283, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:ae8a5b6f-3f8d-466c-916e-97970ff21e89>", "text": "Growing Strawberries for Real Flavor!\nThose red things you can buy in the supermarket in winter do not taste like real strawberries, and they are crunchy instead of melt-in-your-mouth.

Strik\nGrowing strawberries in your home garden can be an interesting and rewarding experience. By growing various cultivars (varieties) of strawberry, you can pick ripe fruit from late spring until frost in the fall. If you care for plants properly, you can obtain enough berries for your family from a relatively small area.\nSelecting a Site\nStrawberries require direct, full sunlight for best production. They bloom early in the spring, so don’t plant them in frost pockets-low-lying areas in which cold air drains or areas (surrounded by tall trees, for example) where cold air is trapped. Avoid planting where tomatoes, peppers, potatoes, eggplant, strawberries, raspberries, or black berries have grown in the past 3 years. These plants can all act as hosts for fungi, such as Verticillium wilt, and insect pests that build up in the soil unless you place these crops on at least a 3-year rotation schedule. Strawberry plantings can remain productive for 3 to 4 fruiting years. You can minimize the buildup of many insect and disease problems by rotating the strawberry patch from one site to another each time you make a new planting. Soils — A well-drained loam soil, high in organic matter, is ideal. Avoid planting in heavy clay soils. If your soil is sandy, pay more careful attention to watering and fertilization. However, strawberries will tolerate a wide range of soil types if you properly modify the soil. You can improve most garden soils by adding organic matter. The soil should be well-drained — strawberries can’t tolerate standing water or “wet feet”. If the only soil you have available has poor drainage, you may be able to improve it by tilling and adding organic matter. Planting on ridges or raised beds also helps if soils drain poorly (see “Preparing the soil” and “Planting systems”).\nSelecting a Cultivar\nStrawberry cultivars are normally placed in one of three categories (or types), based on their responses to day length (photoperiod) and the season in which they produce a crop: June-bearers, everbearers, and day-neutrals. June-bearers produce one crop a year, usually from early June to July.", "score": 0.849145412, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:9cdeac01-a9c0-438b-998a-cd095339266d>", "text": "Home > Strawberry Plants\nStrawberry Elsanta is an excellent mid-season strawberry, producing lots of orange-red fruit that have a good shelf life.

However, to move up to the next level of strawberry growing, you can easily start your own plants from runners, aka stolons.\nMany experienced growers create their own starts in late summer, after the plants have fruited. At this time of year, strawberry plants send out runners with small clone plants at each node. Set the clones into small pots (one per container) while still attached to the runners, burying the runners into the potting soil or pinning them down with a small piece of wire to hold the node in place.\nOnce the roots are established at the node, you can clip the runners from the mother plant. Steve Shepperson, a Kentucky grower who includes strawberries in his diversified crop production, recommends waiting four to six weeks for the new clones to establish themselves in the pots and to keep them under shade if possible.\nThe potting of your new strawberry plants should take place around early August. Once the root systems become more established, they can be set into a bed mulched with plastic or straw by early September.\nAfter your plants of gone dormant for the winter, insulate your new strawberry bed with straw to prevent frost damage. StrawberryPlants.com has a list of great tips for over-wintering your perennial strawberry patch, including how to tell when your plants have gone dormant:\n“Strawberry plants typically go dormant when the temperatures have dropped into the mid-20-degree-F range for three to four consecutive days. Plants can usually be identified as dormant by the older leaves, which will turn brown first. The younger leaves will turn from a bright green to a dull green or gray color.”\nIf the weather is variable in early spring, you may need to cover your strawberries with a row cover to prevent the blossoms from being damaged by a late frost.", "score": 0.846904457, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:e6cc8ce0-1b71-48e4-98ae-7e0f2a9033dd>", "text": "Temperature has a major influence on strawberry physiology and can override day length as the control mechanism for flowering. If temperatures drop too low vegetative growth is inhibited causing poor flower and fruit formation. Conversely if temperatures are too high strawberry plants will wilt and stop producing flowers and fruit.\nStrawberries grown from seed will usually take two to three years to mature, not the ideal situation for hydroponic growers. Early in the season, after risk of frost is over, purchase cold-stored runners from your local nursery. Always use runners that are certified virus tested. Cold stored runners are off-shoots of a mature strawberry plant (also known as a mother plant) that have been snipped off and rooted, forming a clone of the original strawberry plant. They are kept in cold storage through the winter. Ideally the runners you choose will be in flower or have buds visible.\nDetermine which hydroponic gardening method will be suitable for your location and number of plants. Ebb and flow or flood and drain works well for a large number of plants, however, it is totally immobile once set up. Smaller, multi-tiered deep water culture, NFT (Nutrient Film Technique) or drip irrigation gardens seem to be the preferred choice for both hobby and commercial growers.\nCarefully remove the runners or new strawberry plant from its container. Remove as much of the earth as you can by gently shaking and massaging the roots. Submerge the entire root system in a bucket of cold water for about ten minutes then rinse roots under cold running water to remove any remaining dirt. Be very careful to inflict as little damage as possible to the roots and tiny root hairs as too much breakage will seriously stress plants and impair growth. Dry or brittle leaves and roots should be removed at this time.\nIt is important to keep the roots moist while planting. Exposure to the sun or wind will quickly dry out the tender rootlets. This drying will cause failures in the establishment of the planting. A convenient way to keep the roots moist is to wrap them in wet burlap and then carry them in a pail or basket.\nLine the bottom of a hydroponic mesh pot with a sterile growing media.

Carol M. Arroyo Grande\nPropagation, the art of multiplying plants, is one of the most rewarding challenges that a home gardener can undertake. Propagation techniques take many forms, but all involve using plant parts to create a new plant.\nFirst, there is seed propagation which requires the correct light, heat, and humidity to be successful. Methods of asexual propagation include cuttings, layering, budding, and grafting. Cuttings are defined by softwood, semi hardwood, and hardwood. Each plant species has a particular time that's best for successfully rooted cuttings. Asexual propagation uses the leaves, stems or roots of a parent plant to create a new plant.\nLayering can happen naturally when a lower branch of a shrub grows along the ground, maintaining contact with the soil while the tip of the branch is pointed upward out of the soil. The section in or along the soil will root. You can snip off the branch that has formed roots and plant it in a pot. The same feat can be accomplished intentionally above ground with the method referred to as air layering. Make a surface cut on a branch, enclose the wound with moistened moss, and then wrap plastic around it. In time, it will form roots.\nPropagation by grafting enables you to combine different varieties of citrus or stone fruits on a single tree creating what's often called a fruit cocktail tree. Tomatoes plants also lend themselves well to grafting.\nAnother method is propagation by division. The group of plants referred to as bulbs, which includes bulbs, corms, rhizomes, tubers and tuberous plants, are propagated by division. For maximum productivity, dig them up annually, divide them and replant them. You may have multiple cymbidium plants in a single container. To maximize its growth and beauty, remove the entire clump from the container, divide the plants, and replant each in a separate container.\nFor additional information on seed propagation, tomato grafting, and cuttings, register to attend the Master Gardeners Advice to Grow By workshop set for March 18th, from 10:00 am to 12:00 pm at the Garden of the Seven Sisters in San Luis Obispo.

As the plants became more popular in the home decor market, the manufacturers wanted to find a less expensive and more practical way to make these types of plants without sacrificing quality and realism. They found that polyester worked well for the leaves and if they silk screened the details on the fabric they could make the leaves look more realistic than their silk counterparts. Most silk plants are made from this material rather than silk because of the lower cost and more detail that can be added to the look. The \"silk plants\" name just stuck and with new technology the artificial plants and flowers are looking more lifelike than ever before.\nMany artificial trees and plants are still using real wooden trunks and stems to give them the most authentic look possible. Real coconut bark is used on many artificial palm trees to cover up any plastic parts that are used in the plant. On some of the silk banana trees real banana bark is used on some of the higher quality trees to cover the trunk to give it not only a realistic look but also a realistic feel also. Wire is infused in most stems to give you the ability to shape the trees and plants to your liking and also adds to the durability of the plant.\nNext time you hear the term \"silk plants\", you can remember that at one time they were made from silk but now they are made mostly from a silk screened polyester.", "score": 0.824716866, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:da23291d-48e4-4175-9d3d-2baf344aac10>", "text": "All Free Crochet Afghan Patterns is having a giveaway for Lux Adventure Collection Recycled Yarn.

Here we go round the mulberry bush so early in the morning?”\nThat little ditty was popular around 1840, when mulberry trees were gaining popularity in Europe and on the U.S. mainland but had only recently been introduced to Hawaii. Sometime in the early 1800s, a black-fruited cultivar of Morus alba known as “nigrobacca” was introduced to the islands for landscape use. Today, the trees are known here as lovely, drought tolerant plants that produce edible, tasty berries.\nThe genus Morus is in the Moraceae family and includes about 15 botanically separate species, all known as mulberries. The classification is complicated with numerous cultivars and varieties that have resulted from widespread hybridization of the species. All are deciduous trees that are native to warm and subtropical regions, mostly in Asia.\nMulberry trees were cultivated for several thousand years in their native China as food for silkworms. The worms, whose cocoons produce silky thread, are very host- specific. Today, billions of pounds of mulberry leaves are consumed by silkworms throughout the world in the annual production of the more than 70 million pounds of silk. To date, silkworms are not known to exist in Hawaii, however.", "score": 0.819877446, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:e69f3ab1-bff5-44f1-96bb-54ed9810ca1a>", "text": "TREENWAY SILKS - Harmony Silk Floss - # 0213 Celadon - is currently on backorder.

However, the white sap of mulberry bush (or mulberry tree) may be stimulating, toxic, and slightly hallucinogenic. Hence, it is advisable not to consume the sap in its raw form.\nThe leaves of the mulberry bush (or mulberry tree) play an important role in the silk industry. The Bombyx mori (silkworm) feeds on Mulberry leaves, especially those of white mulberry bush. The silk factories produce silk from the cocoons of these silkworms.\nThe wild silk moth and also other Lepidoptera larvae feed on mulberry leaves.\nGenerally, the mulberry bush (or mulberry tree) develops numerous fruits. These fruits derive their color from anthocyanins. These anthocyanins produce water-soluble rich fruit colors. Hence, they serve as natural food colorants in food industries. There is a huge demand in the commercial markets for these natural food colorants.\nDuring the Khmer Empire era (Angkorian age) of Southeast Asia, Buddhist monks manufactured papers from the mulberry tree barks. They used these papers to make books (kraing).\nThe Hidaka Washi company, based in Japan produces the world’s thinnest paper (Tengujo). It started paper production in 1949. The paper is so thin, that it appears to be almost transparent. Hidaka Washi uses stems of mulberry bushes (Kozo), tororo-aoi plant liquid (Neri), and alkaline water to produce this paper.\nThis paper is used in many applications.

You assess each putting routine with the critical eye of a quality control specialist, and you hold your breath as each white speck glides along the green, hoping it will just disappear so you don’t have to stand in the fairway and take any more passive-aggressive practice swings.\nSlow play is the bane of a golfer’s existence, whether your club allows only foursomes or a mix of players per tee time. It has always been part of golf, but not until 2019 did the U.S. Golf Association create a rule suggesting a time limit for each shot.\nStill, slow play is not something that can be fixed with just a rule. It’s born out of a variety of factors and perhaps highlights the unhurried nature of the game against the frenetic pace of our modern life.\nRule 5.6b suggests that the first player to play from tee to green should play his or her shot within 40 seconds. This provides a guideline for both recreational and tournament rounds in terms of pace of play, though slow play looks vastly different in these two arenas.\nRecreational golf can get backed up because courses jam the tee sheet to get as many players on the course as possible. Often, those golfers take more shots and that means more time.\nDarin Green, the Florida State Golf Association’s Director of Rules and Competitions, says pace does not have to be totally dependent on skill, however. In his experience, players shooting rounds in the 100s have been able to keep up with those shooting in the 80s.\nRyan Farb, Director of Rules and Competition for the Northern California Golf Association, agrees, and thinks pace of play is all about groupings.\n“There are slow players at every level,” he said.\nTo mitigate slow players’ effect on a field (or a tee sheet), Farb says you need a balance of field size, intervals, and size of group.\n“If one is overloaded, it slows things down.”\nSlow pace becomes exacerbated in tournament play with the addition of both players who are not tournament experienced and players who are grinders.\n“There are two types of players: Those who are deliberate at everything they do on the course, and those who roll out of bed slowly in the morning,” says Green.", "score": 0.826170325, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:54547150-9a83-4156-9a7e-ff832e5f0cd8>", "text": "Additionally, many athletes feel that they can move more freely andNaturally in shorts.\nThe PGA Tour’s decision to ban shorts ultimately harms both the athletes and the fans. Athletes are forced to play in uncomfortable conditions, and fans are deprived of seeing the athletes at their best. If the tour is truly interested in ensuring that its players appear professional, it should reconsider its policy on shorts.\nWhat is the 40 second rule in golf\nWhen a player is ready to take their shot, they should have 40 seconds to do so. If they take longer, it can interfere with other players and slows down the game. Having a Pace of Play Policy helps to keep the game moving and prevents interference from other players.\nThe golfer tees off at each hole compound with the aim of getting their ball as close as possible to the putting green (as close to the hole as possible). The goal is to have the fewest number of strokes by the time the ball is finally holed.\nWhat club will give you more distance on your shot\nWhen attempting to maximize distance, the driver is typically the best club to use. However, not all golfers are good at hitting a driver, in which case using a fairway wood may be a better option. Ultimately, it is up to the golfer to decide which club will give them the best results.\nWhen you turn your shoulders on a backswing, your left front shoulder should move down towards the ground. This will help you develop a better turning motion and prevent excessive energy from being wasted.\nWhat is the magic move in the golf swing\nThe “Magic Move” is simply returning your right elbow to your side on the downswing. Once the right elbow returns to the body on the downswing, the entire dynamics of the golf swing become much more efficient. This move allows the body to rotate more around the spine, which gives the golfer more power and better control over the ball.\nDear Data Entry Team,\nPlease find attached the video on the six basic steps of the data entry process.

This Time Par system will be used as a baseline for the Pace of Play Policy but will not limit any player’s responsibility to play in accordance with the Rules of Golf.\nTime Par is set for the first three groups. After the third group, proper pace is based on remaining “in position,” which means within 14 minutes of the group in front. If a group falls behind, they have one timing increment (# holes between checkpoints) to recover before becoming liable to a penalty. Individuals immediately become liable for a penalty for any action outside Rules compliance which prevents a group from regaining position (see specific actions covered below). For following groups, no penalty would be applied IF it plays under its Time Par from the time notified or the first checkpoint is missed.\nThere may be two to six checkpoints on the course, determined by the scope of the event and volunteer support.

In hit games played by strict rules, each player plays their ball until bored, no matter how many hits he can take. In the game it is acceptable to just pick up the ball and “deliver the hole” after a player has made enough hits that it is mathematically impossible for the player to win the hole. My grandparents taught me the sport that they were avid players retired and were fully aware when I was ready to graduate from the driving range to tee.\nGolf is a fun hobby and competitive sport where players try to hit their golf ball in different holes along a golf course in as few shots as possible. A standard golf course has 18 holes, although there are shorter 9-hole courses for beginners. Players start the game on the first hole in the field and move through all holes in sequence. At the beginning of each hole, there is a “tee off” area where players make their first shot for that hole. The soft, short grass around the hole is called ‘green’ and the grass between the outlet area and the green is called ‘skin’.”.”In a player’s turn, they place their ball on a T-shirt on the floor in the starting area, choose a stick to swing and use the stick to punch the ball into the hole. Once everyone in the group has taken their first shot, each player places their golf ball and takes another turn, starting with the player furthest from the hole.\nPutting is similar to a regular swing, except that it is not that difficult and the player does not want the ball to be broadcast. Once each player has put his ball into the hole, the group moves to the next hole. Playing a hole on a golf course starts by bringing a ball into play by hitting it on the ground with a stick . It is allowed for this initial recording in any hole, but the golfer does not have to place the ball on a T-shirt before hitting it.", "score": 0.813718617, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:c1e1ea9a-9ca5-48ee-ab70-6a4d621cd7ac>", "text": "After surveying his options, which included relief from the TIO but in an area of thick rough, he decided to play the ball from the deck.

He must take relief, without penalty.\" Relief is provided within one club length of the nearest point of relief.\nPlaying the ball as it lies may seem more complicated now but it’s only that way in unusual circumstances.

Players who shoot par or close can finish a round in under three hours, even with a twosome. Players with a handicap of above 20 can take more than five hours to play, especially if the course is busy.\nPlayers who shoot closer to par can finish in under three hours depending on the course traffic; their shots will probably be more accurate and carry a little farther, decreasing the amount of time spent traveling and looking for balls.\nCourses differ. A round of 18 holes obviously takes longer than nine holes. Par-3 courses (total par 54) generally take less time to complete than a regulation course (par 70 to 72). Course yardage matters as well: Courses with long par-5s (550-600 yards) and 4s (400-465 yards) generally take a little longer than courses with shorter holes.\nDriving or Walking\nPlayers who ride in cart should take a little less time to play than those who are walking, though par and better players can finish in 2 1/2 hours walking without a backup on the course. When riding, sometimes it is best to drop a player off with few clubs at his ball, then drive to another ball to hit. This could save more than a half-hour each round.\nSize of Group\nGroup size makes a difference as well. Foursomes take longer than twosomes or a single, although sometimes smaller groups will pair up on the course, extending he length of the round.\nGolfers should always follow proper etiquette to not hold up others.

Selfishness or ignorance on the part of other players can seriously impair the enjoyment of others.\nBearing this in mind please observe the following whilst on the course.\nCare of the Course\nHoles in bunkers\nBefore leaving a bunker, a player should carefully fill in and smooth over all holes and footprints made.\nRestore divots and plug marks\nThrough the green, a player should ensure that any turf cut or displaced is replaced at once and pressed down, and that any damage to the putting green made by the ball or the player is carefully repaired. See the section on repairing pitchmarks for more information.\nDamage to green\nFlagsticks, Bags etc. Players should ensure that when putting down bags, or the flagstick, no damage is done to the putting green and that neither they nor their caddies damage the hole by standing close to it, handling the flagstick or in removing the ball from the hole. The flagstick should be properly replaced in the hole before the players leave the putting green.\nDamage through practice swings\nIn taking practice swings players should avoid causing damage to the course, particularly the tees, by removing divots.\nConsideration For Other Players\nPlayers in range\nNo player should play until the players in front are out of range.\nIn the interest of all, players should play without delay. If a match fails to keep its place on the course, and lose in distance more than one clear hole from those in front, it MUST invite those playing behind to come through.\nSearching for a ball\nPlayers searching for a ball should signal the players behind them to pass as soon as it becomes apparent that the ball will not be easily found; they should not search for five minutes before doing so. They should not continue play until the players following have passed and are out of range.\nMarking of cards\nWhen the play of a hole has been completed, players should immediately leave the putting green.

Itís okay to have fun out there, keeping in mind respect for other players who do take it serious.\nThe tee box\nThink of the tee box as a stage with a spotlight. Everybody gets his or her turn to shine. Try to remain quiet and out of the golferís view, including your shadow that may hinder the golferís concentration at address. The best position to stand when a player is addressing the golf ball would be to the other side, opposite of his golferís arm extension. You should be standing far enough back to see the club head and golf ball of the player addressing the ball. By taking this position, you would definitely be giving the player room to concentrate, unless he can see your shadow or hear the chatter of your clubs or talk. When you must stand behind or front of a golfer addressing his or her shot, take a second to ask if itís okay and or are you far enough away. Act like a caddie when another player is playing a shot. Watch the golf ball finish rolling and mark the spot with a tree or bush. A lot of golfers do not like to watch their ball land, if itís a bad shot. By doing this for your fellow golfer, it will help speed up play. Try to refrain from yelling nice shot or great shot, when youíre around another tee box or green. When you must tell a joke, wait until itís youíre stage.\nAround the green can be a little more complex for the new golfer. Fix as many golf marks as you can, besides your own. A lot of golfers do not fix their ball marks on approaches to the green. Sometimes players get excited about their golf shot and forget. Ask other playerís to help, if there is more than a couple and your not holding up other players behind you.\nThere are typically four or three golf balls lying on the green.", "score": 0.12371384546084803, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:afb3661a-f3a6-4b09-95ff-bc07fe719e9c>", "text": "Most golfers try to eyeball the tee height, not really giving it a second thought.

Heather Glen is part of the Glens Gold Group and is located in Little River, South Carolina just minutes from the heart of Myrtle Beach. The historic 19th century Scottish design gives it a very unique look and feel compared to other course along the Grand Strand. From the time golfers enter the property they get the feel of being on a traditional Scottish golf links course. It is a great experience for golfers whether it is their first visit or they have played the course dozens of time.\nHeather Glen Golf Course earned its first national ranking in 1987. Golf Digest named this Willard Byrd design the #1 New Public Course. Over the years since then the course has been recognized many, many times by various golf publications. Golf World named it a top 30 golf course in South Carolina (2010). Golf Styles magazine tabbed Heather Glen “Top 100 Must Play Courses In the Carolinas” (2006). It was also named 4-star “Places to Play” by Golf Digest in 2005). Obviously, Heather Glen is a course that needs to be on golfers list of places to play when they come to Myrtle Beach.\nHeather Glen Golf Links is a 27-hole facility that provides a tremendous environment for golfers of all ages and ability levels. Each 9 hole course is unique from the others yet blend together quite nicely. The experience golfers feel on the golf course is fantastic. Set against a background of native oaks, towering pines, freshwater ponds and meandering streams makes for a memorable round of golf for all its visitors.\nThe putting surfaces are Tif Dwarf Bermuda are always kept in great shape that keeps the ball rolling to the hole. Golfers playing Heather Glen always compliment the quality of the greens and remark how fun the are to putt. From tee to green the fairways are receptive and rolling but don’t get too comfortable as they are also guarded by fairway bunkers and large waste areas that await wayward tee shots. The hazards outline the fairways and provide quite a view from the tee boxes.

Rules 26-1 (Water Hazard Rule), 27-1 (Ball Lost or Out of Bounds) and 28 (Ball Unplayable) allow a player to replace a golf ball because it cannot be recovered or it cannot be played.\nCan you switch balls in golf?\nIf the “one ball rule” is not in effect, however, golfers may swap out different types of golf balls at any point in a round of golf, so long as the change is made in-between holes rather than during the play of a hole. Rule 15-1 states: “A player must hole out with the ball played from the teeing ground ”\nIs it legal to use a tee on the fairway?\nRule 5.4 Use of tee on fairway or in rough\nYou can use a tee not to exceed 6 inches anywhere on the fairway or rough.

The truth is Mulligans are a tremendous waste of time and are a major contributor to slow play. Some folks feel they deserve to take Mulligans every time they hit a poor shot, and the average golfer can hit many of them. Buck up and take responsibility for your game and your swing. If you feel the desperate need to hit the ball again, do so and take the stroke. This will soon cure your desire to take a Mulligan.\nTHE FLYING CLUBS\nWe can all get frustrated on the course. Our rage can occasionally result in throwing our clubs. This is considered very bad form and you can injure your fellow players. If for some reason you find yourself hurling clubs, throw them forward; that way at least you can pick them up on the way to your ball and not slow the game down.\nTHE NEXT TEE BOX\nAs you approach the green by foot or riding cart, find the next tee box. It’s a good idea to place your clubs or cart in that area and then arrive at the green. After everyone has holed out they can go straight to the next tee and tee off without having to go back- ward or sideways to find their carts and clubs, making for faster play.\nIf your ball isn’t quite on the green, you can do two things: play the shot first then bring your clubs to the tee and return with your putter, or bring your clubs to the next tee and carry back your putter with the club you’ll use to get onto the green. Be careful here: When two clubs are out of the bag, it’s easy to lose one.\nPlaying through is allowing the group of golfers behind you to play ahead of you, and it is the right thing to do. However, if there were any situation in golf where generally civil folks lose it, this is it. Egos tend to clash when a good group of golfers catches up to an average group. The average group tends to feel inferior, while the better group tends to feel superior. Both are wrong.

The answer is that it depends on the complexity of the change you are undertaking and the amount of time you invest in developing it.\nI think most golfers know that. Your way of life is a product of all the different habits you have developed knowingly and unknowingly over your life time. In the case of changing golf stroke habits it can take a long time.\nAnd here's why?\nThe simplest way to explain it is that you have 13 major joints in your body moving in three dimensions plus the timing required to move them at the correct time and you are required to propel a golf club around your body inside of two seconds and strike a stationary sphere in such a way that the result is a solidly struck golf shot that travels to your target more often than not.\nI bet you thought that it was a lot simpler than that? “Swing it back and through,” “turn your body back and swing your arms through” etc.\nNow when you see the top professionals hitting shot after shot down the fairway and onto the green making it look easy you’ll realise that it far from easy. However even a complex activity like a golf swing can look easy when it is mastered.\nToday we’re seeing a lot of golf books coming out that are marketed to average amateur golfers suggesting that changing your golf swing is something that is relatively easy to learn and do. This partly explains the wide performance gap between amateur golfers and professional golfers.\nAmateur golfers are being exposed to information that is technically not correct. Many golf instructors know this first hand as they have had the experience of a golfer they’re teaching expecting their golf swing to perform optimally in a club competition the very next day after just 45 minutes on the lesson tee.\nGolf instructors are good but not that good.\nI have personally known of golfers to fly to the other side of the world to have a golf lesson or two with a well known golf instructor, and after paying a significant sum of money for the golf lesson they find out that the change that has been suggested will take months to improve!\nThe expectations of golfers of all levels (amateurs to professionals) can be a long way from the reality of what’s really required to successfully change an aspect of your golf swing technique.", "score": 0.0026514487821988225, "source": "sparse"}]}

Therefore, when the club learned of the UNESCO Dive for Peace Day, there was no question that we would take part.\nAlthough the events of the second World War on Lake Constance are relatively well known, most sport divers do not realize that the lake also presents an opportunity to dive in memory of the first World War. Zeppelins are, of course, a common sight over the lake today, but during World War I, these airships also played an important role militarily. In fact, without the demand created by the war, they would probably not exist. The first Zeppelins were built out on the water in a gigantic floating hangar, and it is for this reason that we chose the lake as our destination on Dive for Peace Day.\nIn particular, we decided to search for the remains of the warehouses that had been located in shallow water. We knew the location of some warehouses from historic documents related to the airship hangars. No one from our group had yet dived in the shallow waters of the lake though, so we didn’t know what to expect once we arrived. In spite of this, we assumed that, in the shallow water, we could first explore the site on snorkel.\nAt 17:00, seven of our divers departed Konstanz-Stadd aboard the 15m long MV Hörnle; We chose to travel by boat in order to reach a more remote dive site. After a short stop at the EADS dock to pick up two divers from an associated dive club, we continued on or way. We had to proceed very carefully, however, as the remains of numerous piers lay hidden in the shallow water.\nWe anchored the boat in shallow water, and proceeded out on snorkel to inspect some nearby remains that were marked as “underwater obstacles.” In and among the lush vegetation of the lake, we discovered the remains of some reinforced concrete. The concrete bent in the direction of the shore, and protruded somewhat out of the water. We were especially interested in the end of the remains that lay farthest from the shore.", "score": 0.09859834315347724, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:712b609d-f31d-4f96-a362-aeadd12111a1>", "text": "Lake Constance is a large body of inland water in the tri-border region of Germany, Austria and Switzerland. In terms of surface area, it is the third-largest lake in central Europe and in terms of water volume it is the second largest one, right behind Lake Geneva. It originated from the Rhine glacier during the last ice age; its German name “Bodensee” is derived from the name of the village of Bodman, where a large royal palace was located in the Middle Ages. Lake Constance’s most important inlet, contributing two thirds of the lake’s water, is the Alpine Rhine. The lake’s only outlet is the Upper Rhine, which forms the Rhine Falls in Schaffhausen.\nThere are three distinct geographic areas within Lake Constace, the “Obersee” (upper lake) which constitutes the majority of the lake between Constance and Bregenz, the “Überlinger See” (Überlingen lake) and the “Untersee” (lower lake), which is cut off from the rest of the lake by the Seerhein. Whilst the Untersee is fairly shallow, the Obersee’s deepest point measures 253 metres / 830 feet, its widest point reaching 14 km / 9 miles. The Überlinger See also goes as far down as 147 metres / 482 feet and offers interesting scuba diving sites, whose difficulty should however not be underestimated.\nDue to its large surface, the region around Lake Constance has its own micro-climate. Winters are typically milder than in surrounding regions, while Summers tend to be colder. During very hot spells a light breeze is very common, while high levels of humidity are known to cause sweltry conditions at times. Föhn, a hot alpine downdraft, is also typical of the Lake Constance region, offering spectacularly far-reaching views, however causing headaches for some people. As Bregenz is situated directly next to the mountains, there is twice as much precipitation here as in Constance. In fact, the western part of the Lake is indeed rather dry. The water temperatures are pleasant and range between 16 and 23 degrees centigrade in the time between May and October.\nDespite the fact that snow in April is not totally unheard of, the Lake Constance region is typically known for an early start of spring, usually at the beginning of March.", "score": 0.03977992777248659, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:72c372ec-44b7-43fe-920b-cff8b7c3e0e9>", "text": "The expedition TRANSDRIFT VIII took place from August 20 to September 27, 2000. 18 scientists from Constance, Kiel, Moscow, St. Petersburg and Tiksi participated in the expedition. One of their main tasks was to obtain sediment cores in order to find evidence of the existence of submarine permafrost in the Laptev Sea. For this purpose, two Russian research vessels were used: RV Yakov Smirnitskiy and the drilling vessel Kimberlit. In addition, the seasonal variability of environmental parameters in the Laptev Sea were to be investigated.\nAt three stations, sediment cores with a total length of 40 m and a drilling depth of up to 26 m were obtained. At two of these stations permafrost soil was found at depths between 7 and 12 m below the seafloor. This result had not been expected as it had been surmised according to seismic records, obtained during the TRANSDRIFT V expedition with RV Polarstern in 1998, as well as model calculations that permafrost would be found at significantly greater depths.\nOnboard Yakov Smirnitskiy, comprehensive oceanographic, geochemical and biological measurements were carried out at 48 stations. At three stations the diurnal variability of environmental parameters was measured for a time period of more than 30 hours. These data will provide a validated basis for modeling of the modern environment in the Laptev Sea.\nClick here to read the weekly reports.\nThe participants of the expedition:\n- Henning Bauch, GEOMAR Research Center for Marine Geosciences\n- Philipp Fischer, Constance University\n- Jens Hoelemann, Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research\n- Heidemarie Kassens, GEOMAR Research Center for Marine Geosciences\n- Conrad Kopsch, Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research\n- Frank Niessen, Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research\n- Annette Scheltz, Institute for Polar Ecology\n- Michael Schmid, Institute for Polar Ecology\n- Kirsten Tuschling, Institute for Polar Ecology\n- Martin Wessels, Constance University\n- Carolyn Wegner, GEOMAR Research Center for Marine Geosciences", "score": 0.008654266685318216, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:45832a41-0e38-4c31-98f2-c35303ca30f1>", "text": "The closest I come to the treasure is a list he wrote just one year before he died.

Conveniently built alongside the lake, so people thousands of years ago were close to the trade and traveling routes and would not be impacted by the changing water levels.

You can tour the castle on your own and join a guided tour to the top of the tower.

Now Kunz is a marine biologist, scientific diver, underwater photographer and cameraman, and embattled environmentalist. He travels the world. Wherever there is water and something interesting to discover or document in it (actually anywhere...), you can likely find him there.\n\"It’s important for me to have color accuracy in the workflow. I need to be sure that my computer will show me the colors as they really are. It’s the only way I know that my pictures will look like they should when I send them to my client or they are published in a book. The built-in sensor on my CG2730 ensures that my monitor is perfectly calibrated. I have configured it to correct itself on a regular basis.“ - Uli Kunz\nOne day, Kunz will be floating around on a rubber boat through the icy Arctic waters for hours, in the hopes of spotting the first orcas, only to hop over the side with his camera if he does. A few weeks later, he will be exploring on a sea cave expedition in France. And then only days later, he might be in the middle of the Indian Ocean, swimming in crystal-clear, tropical waters while documenting the coral bleaching of the reefs gripping the Maldives. Kunz’s destinations are as diverse as their individual geographies, yet there is a higher purpose at work: documenting the special qualities of the underwater world he encounters. Based now in Kiel, Germany, he needs these pictures of flora and fauna – many species of which most people will never have the chance to see themselves – in order to protect the world’s largest habitat.\nIt Takes Special Equipment\nIn addition to the diver’s skills and diving gear, taking pictures below the water’s surface is more demanding on the photography equipment and lighting than normal photography above water. Uli Kunz comments, “The colors underwater are fantastic.” However, the problem is making these colors appear properly in the picture or film. The water filters out the reds and oranges and yellows from the light spectrum as you descend more and more.", "score": 0.00231540694380389, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:202cfeb7-d50e-4b82-b478-ba6cd75d9a23>", "text": "TravelRoach specializes in adventure trekking tours and cultural travel in India.

These two programs aim to facilitate changes in attitude and behaviour, and organizational change through awareness. They also provide psychological fitness training to CF personnel at different stages of their careers, including in the course of initial recruit training. Training for all members allows them to take steps to preserve their personal wellbeing: leaders learn how to recognize and react to stress indicators in their personnel, all medical personnel receive clinical training on the recognition and treatment of symptoms, and in-depth specialized training is provided to mental health professionals.\nRehabilitation of a CF member must include the family. When a CF member is seriously ill or injured, the CF and VAC work together to provide support to the family. Although they are very resilient, many families require several forms of assistance in these difficult times, including child care, counselling and social support, and referral to local social service agencies. The Military Family Services Program (available through the MFRCs located on bases throughout the country), plays a pivotal role in providing these support services to families when a loved one has been injured or becomes ill.\nThe CF continue to support the families and communities of ill or injured personnel in the following ways: by ensuring services are in place to bolster family preparedness and resilience so that they can effectively manage the special demands associated with having an ill or injured family member; by doing what is necessary so that each casualty remains firmly connected to and supported by his or her family, particularly during lengthy periods of acute care and physical rehabilitation in distant specialized facilities; by providing in-home services and respite support to families who must provide additional and continuing care to a loved one throughout the recovery process; and by providing guidance for families who may be approached by the media at the very time that their privacy is of the utmost importance.\nIn response to evolving military family needs, the CF promulgated the CF Family Covenant in September of 2008. The Covenant establishes the social and moral foundations for all current and future CF policies, programs, and services as they pertain to military families. At about the same time, the CF launched initiatives focused on child care, mental health and social support, and access to medical care; initiatives also addressed spousal/ partner employment, spousal/partner education as well as reunions during and after deployments.

The fact sheets cover topics like managing grief, managing stress, dealing with compassion fatigue, and tips for families welcoming their disaster responders home.\nTug McGraw Foundation\nThe Tug McGraw Foundation is dedicated to helping people with neurological disorders, traumatic brain injury, and post-traumatic stress. Their website includes help and information for first responders and their families. This is a natural fit since many veteran first responders have post-traumatic stress disorder stemming from what they experience on duty.\nThe website provides crisis hotlines and connects first responders and their families with key resources that can help them resume happy and productive lives such as diet, exercise, community, and spirituality.\nExercise and Diet Resources\nIn order to combat the effects of repeated traumatic events, paramedics and first responders must pay attention to their physical health as well: exercise and diet are key aspects which most people are unaware of (or think don’t apply to them). Keeping the body in the best shape it can be in not only makes first responders more resilient to the negative effects of the job, but it leads to an increase of happiness and mental clarity.\nThe Mayo Clinic explains the importance of strength training as well as cardiovascular conditioning.", "score": 0.829192638, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:f08599b4-7cdd-4f0d-8078-c142f8b4b3cc>", "text": "The fire service has begun several campaigns to raise awareness among fire chiefs and firefighters to health issues, including the Heart-Healthy Firefighter Program set up by the National Volunteer Fire Council, and a joint Wellness-Fitness Task Force created by the firefighters union and chiefs association.

There are numerous benefits to having in-home care for a family member with Parkinson's Disease.\nAn in-home caregiver can provide personal supervision for a person whose gait has become unsteady or who has issues with their balance due to Parkinson's effect on their muscular coordination. This supervision can prevent slips, falls and accidents which only make a person's health deteriorate even more. Another important benefit provided by home caregivers is consistent nutritious meal planning, since those with Parkinson's Disease have special nutritional needs in order to keep their bones strong and their muscles healthy.\nA person with Parkinson's Disease usually needs one-on-one assistance with even the simplest daily chore or activity that most of us take for granted. An in-home caregiver can assist with everything from bathing and grooming needs to getting dressed, making a trip to the bathroom, getting outside for a short walk for exercise, and reducing the amount of challenges experienced while eating.\nAnother very important reason to use a home caregiver is to encourage the Parkinson's patient to keep up with daily exercise routines designed to help maintain their balance, strength and mobility. Since many Parkinson's Disease patients reach a point when they can no longer operate a motor vehicle, it is extremely helpful to have the services of a caregiver who can drive the individual to doctor's appointments, physical therapy sessions or other places where they need to travel.\nOne of the most important benefits that professional in-home care provides is relief for the spouse or other family members from the daily demands that the challenges of Parkinson's Disease presents. The individual with Parkinson's feels like less of a burden and other family members won't resent having to serve as a full-time nurse to a family member experiencing this difficult neurodegenerative disorder.", "score": 0.828803778, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:54392b61-61e0-4434-b011-d8487be32c2c>", "text": "Firefighter Burn Survivors Week\nA burn injury can affect a firefighter’s life in many ways. Without exception, burns are life altering. They can also be career changing or life ending injuries. Burn scarring can affect mobility, appearance, and functional use of the extremities. Inhalation of smoke, burning debris and toxic byproducts of combustion may seriously or permanently damage the abilities to breathe, function and perform job-related duties.\nThe long-term effects of a burn are not just physical. Following a burn injury, firefighters are at risk of developing psychological trauma associated with the events of injury, a lack of confidence in their professional abilities, and stress related to the time away from the job. As a result of a burn, an injured firefighter must deal with the emotional, physical and financial challenges of recovery and a potentially career ending injury.\nIn partnership with the Adaptive Sports Center, the DC Firefighters Burn Foundation hosts an annual Firefighters Burn Survivors Week in Crested Butte, Colorado. For more than 30 years, the Adaptive Sports Center has been improving the quality of life for people with disabilities through outdoor adventure activities.

Therefore, it is important that the patient has the opportunity to talk about these changes and what this means to them.\nIt is necessary to help them make sense of everything that is going on and to accept losses.

I’ve been visiting Congressional since 1980, when I caddied in two Kemper Opens while looping (summers) on the PGA Tour. As a journalist, I had also covered U.S. Opens there in 1997 and 2011, during the last of which I walked as close to Rory McIlroy as press protocol allowed for 27 holes over the four days of his triumphant march. I should also add for purposes of full disclosure that at the invite of the club in 2016 I returned for a day-long (paid) consulting visit in which I shared with them my sense of the course and its potential for improvement. But I’ve had no subsequent involvement with the club and had not the slightest inkling of how far they would take things – until a visit on my own dime in mid-October.\nCongressional is a big place: 380 acres, with two 18-hole golf courses, the Gold Course and the championship venue Blue Course (home to the U.S. Open in 1964, 1997 and 2011, the PGA Championship in 1976, and the Ryder Cup in 2031).

An impressive sight, the new 45,000 SF clubhouse boasts a Southern Georgian-style structure with a scenic arrival sequence and breathtaking golf course views. A covered outdoor terrace spans the length of the back of the clubhouse. With seating for up to 95 members, this feature provides the perfect atmosphere for member socialization and camaraderie.\nGCC’s interiors celebrate tradition while balancing progressive design. Characterized by versatility and elegance, the interior spaces blend existing furniture, decorative lighting and artwork with renewable flooring and natural products to create a nostalgic, collected look. “Great clubhouse design must combine functionality and aesthetics, both inside and out,” says Chambers’ VP/Director of Interior Design Charlie Turner. “It must be flexible, yet remain durable and timeless, all while responding to lifestyle shifts of today’s membership itself.”\nThe club’s new Pub with a horse-shoe shaped, cross-talk bar has become the epicenter of the clubhouse and encourages members to come together to dine, socialize, and make memories all throughout the week. The building is also designed to offer a wide variety of dining venues carefully arranged around a centralized kitchen to optimize operational efficiencies. This enables GCC’s staff to provide exceptional service for members, their families and their friends—creating a dining experience that can’t be found anywhere else.\nTo incorporate other private club design trends, numerous cutting-edge amenities have also been incorporated into the new building, including wine locker displays, dedicated youth rooms and childcare areas, a café/turn area, and a 2,500 SF fitness center with indoor/outdoor group exercise areas.\nGreenville Country Club embarked on a journey to uphold its 120-year old history while redefining its future through vision, style and brand.

The WGC event was held the prior week so the course was still in championship form, the grandstands were still in place and it felt like a tour event. So, it was cool to play the course under those conditions.\nTPC Blue Monster –We played the TPC Blue Monster out of the gate on day one. We would have preferred to get a round in before tackling the Blue but tee times did not allow it. As you would expect from a PGA site, it was a great golf course. We played the blue tees which stretched the course to 6701 yards. A forecaddie is required to play the Blue Monster so do not be surprised when they show up on the first tee. With the constant winds that blew the Blue was a tough test after a few months away from the game. There is a great variety of holes on the course and the par threes are quite difficult. Most holes have sand and water or both, so take plenty of balls before tackling the Blue. The golf course has very thick, coarse Bermuda rough throughout. So, you get some very difficult lies off the fairways and around the greens. Finally, it is quite a sight to stand on the 18th tee and look down the fairway. With water all along the left side of the hole it is quite a challenge. I managed to make par on 18 so that was a quite a thrill.\nMcLean Signature Course- We played the McLean Course on day two. The course stretches 6602 yards from the blue tees and is quite tight in spots. The McLean Course is completely different that the Blue Monster or Great White. It is a more traditional golf course that sets in and around homes. It has the feel of a Golf Course Community but is still a great golf course. The course is known for its “Bermuda Triangle” holes 13 through 15.

What does that mean?\nIn today's world of retirement communities, there are many options that allow individuals to plan for their future care needs. A fee-for-service Continuing Care Retirement Community (CCRC) is an option that has been available in the United States for many years and recently was permitted under New York licensure regulations that govern CCRCs. Since The Club is a CCRC, if you choose to live in an independent living apartment, independent living townhome or independent living villa and do not need licensed care, your monthly fee will not include a charge associated with care. Should your needs change and you need an increased level of care and assistance, such as assisted living or skilled nursing, you will pay for that care on a daily or monthly basis through an appropriate insurance policy or personal finances. Essentially, there is no \"pre-payment\" for care—as found in lifecare or \"type A\" retirement communities—thus, if you do not need care, you will not pay for the care and your monthly fee will not subsidize the care others receive.\nIf I do need additional care, how will it be provided?\nJust as there are many types of senior living communities, there are many forms of care that an individual may need.

Having always worked in a creative field, he began painting 3 years ago. He first began to feel like a professional artist when he started to sell his paintings, not in the sense of money, but rather that someone would treasure his work enough to want to care for it themselves. He considers his art collections to be of an eclectic taste that involve modern African artists and tribal artefacts due to their interesting human features. He also owns pieces from modern Portuguese artists as well as an original Salavador Dali which he says, keep him humble as an artist. Influenced by artist such as Lionel Smit, Diogo Navarro, Max Gasparini, Gerhard Richter, and Andy Warhol, as well as many other modern and contemporary artists, Henrique defines modern art as an attempt to elevate thought as an important part of a modern society. His own works involve contemporary figurativism to capture intimate and spontaneous emotions through quick brush strokes. He personally cannot offer advice to beginners so that they are not influenced when they choose to communicate through artistic expression.\nA native of Hamburg, Anja Klich finished her art diploma in 2000 from FOS Grafik and Design. As a child, her love of art began in the 5th grade due to a teacher giving her the opportunity to practice art that developed into a lifelong passion. She herself doesn’t collect art, but places her largest artistic influence on Salvador Dali. Her own works involve ideas from her peaceful lifestyle with her family amongst the forest. Her ideas stem from preliminary sketches in which she transforms them from influences such as feelings and music to contemporary art pieces. In 2005, she took a lengthy trip to Australia, which also influences her art still today. Her philosophy is not to stand still, but to continue developing herself as an artist. For her, modern art is a form of continuous self-realisation that involves questioning society. Her advice to beginning artists is to find a theme in which you can present yourself in an authentic manner.\nIf you are interested in seeing the wonderful works of these artists in person, please join us for the official opening event of the Grace Denker Gallery on March 31st at 5pm.

For it is the Spanish who buy their things the most.”\nSo wrote Karel van Mander in 1604, reflecting the importance of Spanish buyers to the market for devotional paintings on copper by Netherlandish artists active in Rome. His remark speaks to a phenomenon that began centuries earlier. Netherlandish art and artists were assiduously brought to Spain from the fifteenth century on. Michel Sittow, who was not Netherlandish by birth but trained in Flemish art tradition, and Juan de Flandes, worked as court painters. Stained glassmaker Arnao de Flandes also moved to Spain during the 1490s and created the windows of several cathedrals. In the sixteenth century, Anthonis Mor painted portraits of many Spanish courtier. Even more prominent was importation of Netherlandish works of art themselves: well-known masterpieces by Rogier van der Weyden, Hieronymus Bosch, and Joachim Patinir (among others) were brought to Spain either by direct commission or through some kind of plunder.\nThough such issues have been treated in monographs of artists or case-study articles, the transregional dialogue between the Netherlands and Spain remains understudied, especially when compared with scholarship on Italian-Netherlandish artistic exchange. With its strong power and influence, the Spanish court not only lured artistic talent from Italy and the Netherlands into its kingdom; Spain also came to play an unparalleled role in disseminating European art on a global scale through its trading and missionary activities. Likewise, the role and influence of Netherlandish art in Spain demands investigation in relation to local artistic tradition.\nWe invite papers to be presented at the annual meeting of the Renaissance Society of America (RSA) in Toronto that explore one of the many aspects of Netherlandish-Spanish artistic relationships, with a particular focus on the artists and works of art that were, at least once, physically situated in Spain.", "score": 0.809670091, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:6e4f2d29-9d72-433a-9314-f7c7f87c37dc>", "text": "The UnSchool Trip: Art and History in Flanders\nYour kids might find history, art or languages boring at school but they won’t in a visit to Flanders.

Jan van Eyck first appeared in The Hague, in October of 1422, as painter and varlet de chambre to John of Bavaria, Count of Holland. Since Van Eyck was referred to at that time as a \"master\", it seems likely that he was born no later than c. 1390. Following the death of John of Bavaria, Van Eyck moved to Bruges and on 19 May 1425 was appointed painter and varlet de chambre to Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy. Until the end of 1429 he resided mainly in Lille but, in addition to his duties as painter, Van Eyck was also entrusted with various secret missions. In 1427 he may have gone to Spain to negotiate a marriage between the Duke of Burgundy and Isabella of Aragon; this was not successful, but in 1428 and 1429 Van Eyck was in Lisbon, where a marriage contract between Philip the Good and Isabella of Portugal was signed, and in December 1429 Isabella, perhaps accompanied by Van Eyck, arrived in Flanders. Following the marriage of Phillip and Isabella in 1430, it is assumed that Van Eyck moved to Bruges where, with the exception of certain secret missions, he spent the rest of his life as court artist to Philip. He also undertook civic commissions; in 1435 he painted and gilded six statues and their tabernacles for the facade of the Town Hall of Bruges. Van Eyck died in late June 1441.

New portrait identifications are provided for the Ghent Altarpiece (1432) and its iconographical prototype, the lost Fountain of Life. These altarpieces are analysed with regard to King João I’s conquest of Ceuta, achieved by his sons, who were hailed as an “illustrious generation.” Strong family ties between the dynastic houses of Avis and Lancaster explain Lusitania’s sustained fascination with Arthurian lore and the Grail quest.\nSeveral chapters of this book are overlaid with a chivalric veneer. A second “secret mission” to Portugal in 1437 by Jan van Eyck is postulated and this diplomatic visit is related to Prince Henry the Navigator’s expedition to Tangier and King Duarte’s attempts to forge an alliance with Alfonso V of Aragon. Late Eyckian commissions are reviewed in the light of this ill-fated crusade and additional new portraits are identified.

The marriage took place amid great festivity at Reading in May 1359 and the considerable financial prospects it opened up were realized within two years, following Henry of Lancaster's death in March 1361. Gaunt was immediately given temporary custody of all the duke's lands and the death of Blanche's sister and coheir, Maude, duchess of Zeeland, a year later in April 1362 cleared the way for a further grant to him of the whole Lancastrian inheritance, together with the titles of duke of Lancaster, and earl of Derby, of Lincoln, and of Leicester, in the following November.

In November, Jordan decided to donate blood at Blood Assurance, where he registered for a chance to donate $1,000 to the charity of his choice.\nRemembering the services of the Ronald McDonald House, Jordan did not hesitate to name them as his favorite charity when he received a phone call from Bonnie Phillips, marketing and special events coordinator for Blood Assurance.\n“I remember them bringing me games to play when I was in the hospital, and I know of other families who have been helped by the Ronald McDonald House,” said Butler.\nAlong with the families who will benefit from his donation to the Ronald McDonald House, Jordan’s blood donation will benefit up to three patients in area hospitals.\n“We appreciate Jordan’s generosity in paying it forward to help other families. His donation will make it possible for 26 families to stay close to the hospital while their critically ill children receive specialty care,” said Jane Kaylor, executive director, Ronald McDonald House Charities of Greater Chattanooga.\nIt costs $55 per day to provide a one night stay for a Ronald McDonald House family. In addition to Jordan’s contributions to his community, his father Joseph recently donated blood in honor of a friend who was scheduled for an upcoming surgery. When their donations are separated into components of platelets, plasma and red blood cells, this father-son duo will help up to 6 patients locally.\nTo learn more about the services of the Ronald McDonald House Charities of Greater Chattanooga, please visit www.rmhchattanooga.com.\nPosted by Lacey Wilson\nLeave a comment:", "score": 0.006081084564342822, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:0c5c6d1d-0894-4bdb-8603-64a4ce8d5f87>", "text": "Willard Scott as Ronald McDonald\nAdded July 7! We now have the first three Ronald McDonald commercials in video format!\nIn the early 1960s, in addition to his radio work, Willard Scott played Bozo the Clown on a local children's TV show. Children love clowns and hamburgers, so it was only natural for Bozo the Clown to make an appearance when the first McDonald's hamburger stand opened in Alexandria, Virginia. Willard tells the story in his book, The Joy Of Living:\nAt the time, Bozo was the hottest children's show on the air.\nYou could probably have sent Pluto the Dog or Dumbo the\nElephant over and it would have been equally as successful.\nBut I was there, and I was Bozo... There was something\nabout the combination of hamburgers and Bozo that was\nirresistable to kids... That's why when Bozo went off\nthe air a few years later, the local McDonald's people\nasked me to come up with a new character to take Bozo's\nplace. So, I sat down and created Ronald McDonald.\nSo Ronald McDonald was born, wearing a paper cup on his nose and a cardboard carry-out tray on his head. (Notice the milk shake, hamburger, and fries on top of the tray.)\nMcDonald's corporate web site\ncredits Willard as being the first Ronald McDonald.\nUnfortunately, McDonald's chose another actor when they\ntook the character into a nationwide ad campaign.\nWillard started playing Ronald in 1963, while the Joy Boys were going strong on WRC. The first Ronald McDonald commercials were filmed that year, with Willard on camera, and Joy Boys partner Ed Walker doing the voice-over announcements. We have three of those commercials here, in audio clips with still frame images. Or, click here for video clips instead!\nIf 1963 doesn't take you back far enough, you can\nlisten to this clip from the Joy Boys\n1961 New Year's show (MP3, 275K)\nin which they read a live spot for McDonald's... now with\neight restaurants in the Washington DC area!\nThanks to Kaptain Kidshow for their help with this story.

Built in 1892 for the first Village President, in the year he assumed office, it was originally located next to Village Hall on Fleetwood Place. The house was relocated to its present location at 920-922 East Sylvan Avenue by Dr. Williams, the Village Health Officer, who acquired the house following Isenring's mysterious departure.\nThe structure was originally a single family residence, but was later subdivided into a duplex. A number of exterior modifications have also been made to the structure over the years. Earlier photographs showed singled siding on the upper level and fairly wide vertical wooden siding on the lower course. The house also some interesting corner details over two of the lower windows on the east side of the house. These ornamental features are still present, although partially obliterated by an enlarged canopy over the front porch.

He acquired a large parcel of land along the shoreline of Whitefish Bay and eventually sold the property to Pabst Brewing Co. for the construction of the Pabst Whitefish Bay Resort. Upon its construction, he operated the resort under lease from Pabst. Isenring's real estate activities also included the development of three subdivisions in Whitefish Bay.\nIsenring was one of the 35 individuals that joined together to incorporate the Village, severing ties from the Town of East Milwaukee. In addition to serving as the Village's first president, he also represented the Village on the Milwaukee County Board.

I would argue that it's the barn. Sure these days farming is a mysterious profession for most of us, but there was a time, and not so long ago that 80% of Americans labored on farms.\nWhen you think of barns you also should think of silos. The towering, vertical silos we know today, especially here in the Midwest, are a truly American innovation, and go hand-in-hand with barns.\nInfluenced by grain storage pits of the \"old world\" and corn cellars of Native Americans, the first known upright wooden silo was constructed in 1873 by Fred Hatch of McHenry County, Illinois. However, Wisconsin bears the honor of having more silos than any other state.\nThe prime reason for Wisconsin’s numerous silos is its dairy industry. Until the 1870s, winter or year-round dairying was rarely an option, because it was difficult to provide sufficient succulent food for cows to maintain milk production. But by storing silage (green fodder) in an air-tight container (silo), it stopped fermentation, preserving the feed until it was needed, creating a boom in dairying.\nThe use of silos spread by word of mouth and through farming magazines. By 1924 there were more than 100,000. During World War I farmers were asked to raise more food for the war effort. Building a silo was equated with patriotism while building a large barn was a symbol of a farmer's prosperity.\nSilos have been built of wood, fieldstone, tile, brick, concrete and steel, and have ranged in height from 35 to 60 feet. Beginning in the 1930s, barns and silos along state roads were sometimes used to advertise products, similar to today’s billboards. The attached photo of a silo (razed in 2003) was along “old” Route 41 (Greenbay Road) in Waukegan. Even with its paint faded with time, you can still see the advertisement for Miller High Life Beer.", "score": 0.807160676, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:4ca48151-2947-4736-a821-cf17069f9332>", "text": "Magical Answers to Wisconsin Lakehouse Exposed\nThe Birth of Wisconsin Lakehouse\nMake sure you bring a picnic with you so you can relish your view of the lake!

Hubbard recalled in the Sunday Argus on July 5, 1896 that the first building built in Fargo was of board and batten, one story, door in the center, with \"a nice pair of elk horns over the door.\" The building was erected by E. Sweet, Jr., one of the bridge builders for the Northern Pacific Railroad. That building is shown in the upper right photograph.\nA. H. (Harry) Moore, a native of Wisconsin, came to what is now the site of Fargo in 1869 to homestead. He built a log house (with the aid of carpenter George Mann) near what was the slough in present day Island Park. The house was later moved to higher ground at 119 4th Street S. At this site it served as a hotel and a jail. The building was later purchased by Henry Hector and it was home to his family until 1952. In 1939 the Pioneer Daughters of North Dakota formally recognized the structure as Fargo’s first wooden house and had a bronze plate affixed to a stone in the front yard. The house was moved in the late 1950s to make way for the new YMCA building. Its new location was 205 23rd Street S. In 1974, it was threatened with demolition, so the Fargo Board of Realtors and Max Moore, grandson of Harry Moore bought the house and donated it to Bonanzaville. It was restored to its original appearance in 1980 by Palmer Forness, and is preserved as Fargo's oldest existing wooden building.\nThe first two story building in Fargo was built by Mr. Pinkham at what was known as No. 27 Front Street (Main Avenue).

Do not take the stamp in the cache!\nThe first step of finding this cache is to identify the following two buildings:\nBuilding 1: In 1925, Joseph and Odile LeMieux built a chapel along a limestone ridge behind their house. At the time, small wayside chapels dotted the region, a convenience for daily devotion by travelers and rural families. This chapel would be different, though. Joseph was a retired stonemason who had helped build grand Great Lakes lighthouses, and her brother Fabian LaPlant was a skilled carpenter. The two men took limestone from the ridge to construct a building approximately 12 by 18 feet in size, with eight exterior windows, a vaulted ceiling with exposed wooden beams, and room inside for a simple altar, the stations of the cross and seating for about ten. Completed in 1925, the chapel was said to be Odile’s pride and joy. The chapel remains open to all visitors to enjoy its history and solitude.\nTwo different pictures of the Chapel Building.\nBuilding 2: This house is the oldest frame structure in the State of Wisconsin. It was built in 1776 by fur-trader Joseph Roi, one of the first seven settlers of La Baye (Green Bay). It was sold in 1805 to Jacques Porlier, another French-Canadian fur-trader. In 1850 Niels Otto Tank, a wealthy Norwegian missionary, obtained the house when he purchased several hundred acres of land, hoping to establish a Moravian colony for Norwegian immigrants, Tank died in 1864 and his wife lived in the cottage until her death in 1891, devoting her life and fortune to missionary work. In 1908 the house was moved from its original site on the Fox River to a new location. It was relocated again in 1975 to its current location.\nTwo pictures of Building 2, the first from c. 1900 and the second as it currently looks.\nOnce you have learned what these buildings are, you need to gather two pieces of information:\n1.

My family ate dinner here on Saturday, June 27 while taking a weekend-long vacation at one of the Wisconsin Dells resorts and staying at a motel a short distance up the street from this restaurant.\nReview of Pizza Pub - Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin\nMy family had dinner at this restaurant this past weekend. Read to find out what I thought of it.\nOur decision to eat at Pizza Pub this past weekend while taking a weekend vacation in Wisconsin Dells was based primarily on the restaurant's location. We were staying in a motel a short distance from the restaurant and, not wanting to walk any more than we had to (or drive), figured it was the best choice. As it turns out, this would have been a restaurant that would have been worth driving to.\nWhen we first walked into the restaurant, there were two things I was really impressed about. The first of these was the fact we were able to be seated quickly. This was a major problem for us the last time we tried to eat dinner at one of the local restaurants and, with two kids in tow, the fact we could sit down quickly was definitely appreciated.\nThe second thing I loved right away was the atmosphere and layout of the restaurant. Their partially enclosed booths gave us a sense of privacy and intimacy and everyone in the family loved it. My oldest daughter, in particular, was fascinated both by the wooden enclosure and the decorations on the wall in our booth.\nWe actually elected not to order pizza (though the pizzas we saw being carried past us admittedly looked good). Instead, I had a meatball sub, my wife had an Italian sub and the kids had pasta from the kids' menu. The food was excellent and came in large portions that were perfect for having leftovers to heat up later at the motel.\nThe one thing that really surprised me about the food was the price. Since Wisconsin Dells is a giant tourist trap, most of the restaurants (and pretty much everything else) are overpriced. That wasn't the case with this restaurant. The food was reasonably priced and, again, offered decent quality, making it worth the money.\nAnother thing that really impressed me about Pizza Pub was the service.", "score": 0.10084381383375388, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:118badbe-075a-45ac-a7ff-160190f2e0b3>", "text": "For example: I said, “oh I that is 1000.00, sorry I only have a limited amount of cash on me, I can’t afford it“.

I managed to walk out of there without buying anything, as I just wasn’t prepared to drop a grand) Wandering Scale: 4 because of fun shops of all kinds of stuff, free drinks and food samples at many of the stores.\nStraw Market: this is a tourist trap of souvenirs. Most of this stuff is tee shirts, hats, cups, jewelry and wooden carved animals, all made in Asia I am certain. It is dark inside the building and the sellers are not exactly pushy, but they are vocal. “Come see my merchandise“, “What do you need?”, “Buy from me!” I liked the vendors up by Fort Fincastle better.

Collect requirements process is the second process of scope management, wich comes after creating the scope management plan. During this second process of PMP Scope management, several techniques can be used to collect requirements. After requirements have been collected and finalized, they are documented as requirements documents.\nAs described in PMP Training, project documents are important for each phase of the project life cycle; and naturally so are the requirements documents. Because requirements are foundations of the project scope and they reflect the expectations of project stakeholders. Requirements history, whether it is in the final list, or eliminated, which deliverable will fulfill the requirement etc. needs to be documented in order to meet all agreed requirements of a project once the project is completed.\nIn this article, we are going into the details of requirements documents. If you’d like to get further information about requirements documents, project management professional courses will give you that specific information.\nWhat is included in Requirements documents?\nLet’s begin by listing the main requirements documents. Requirements documents should include these kinds of requirements:\nBusiness Requirements: Business requirements generally come from the customer of the project. They represent the product features, or what the end outputs of the project need to provide. Let’s consider an e-commerce shopping website example. Developing a retail online shopping site that will get the 2% of the market in the US is an example of business requirement, so it should be documented as a part of requirements documents.\nStakeholder requirements: Any person, group of people, company or parties that will be affected positively or negatively by the project are project stakeholders. Each project stakeholder can bring a requirement to the project which should be a part of requirements documents.\nSolution requirements: Solution requirements are actually technical requirements. For instance, during meetings with the software architecture team of the company, since the customer data of the e-commerce shopping website is critical, software architecture team can require building geographically backed up databases.\nProject requirements: These requirements are generally about schedule and budget. For instance, sponsor of the project might require completing the project in 6 months and with a $1,500,000 budget. This is another example of requirements documents as well.\nTransition requirements: These are the requirements documents that generally describe how to switch from an old system or product to a newer one.", "score": 0.829258859, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:5230a890-48c0-4730-9c17-a1acd3e860b8>", "text": "Scope of work contract can be the part of a contract (not the actual contract) that shows or lists the work/deliverables agreed on and delivered between both parties involved in a contract. In other words, it gives complete detail of the work to be performed in a project or contract, which is then broken down into several sections to provide a general overview of it.\nWhy is it important?\nHaving a scope of work document written is essential in any project or contract. Over the years, one of the biggest problems with verbal agreements is that there is no single point of reference about the scope of work made at the beginning, which can lead to so many issues when there is confusion, miscommunication, misaligned expectations, overpayments dispute, etc. But, suppose a written scope of work is put in place. It nullifies all these situations, gives accountability, helps measure efficiency, ensures both parties work with what is written in the documents, and is not obligated to go beyond what was initially stated. Because of the said importance, the scope of work, or SOW, must be accurate, complete, and well detailed.\nThe features of the scope of work\nAmong the items that should be included in a good SOW are:\n- Project goals: You've stated your problem.

We'll also cover many of the issues outlined in the series, which is based on BICSI's Second Edition of the Customer-Owned Outside Plant Design Manual.\nGet the job. We begin the journey with the proverbial telephone call for new business. Our project designer answers the phone and learns of a new project lead. A large computer company, which owns all the buildings on a business campus, wants to install additional copper and fiber optic cabling throughout the grounds. Some routes will connect new buildings and other routes will constitute upgrades to existing facilities. Our designer must first try to get on the bidder's short list, so his firm can be considered for the design project. Since the computer company is putting out a request for services (RFS), the designer contacts the company and completes the necessary paperwork. Several weeks will go by before he finds out whether his firm has won the bid for the project.\nIf his firm is selected, the project designer needs to set up a meeting with the client to review the project goals. In this meeting, the parties review minimal specifications, required material types, and project deadlines. The client also furnishes the designer with records in the form of CAD drawings that note the locations of all the campus' existing cabling and structures. During the meeting they outline which sections will require new or replacement cabling. At the end of the meeting, the designer should understand the general requirements of the project. His next step is to use the CAD drawings to develop a route study and project schedule.\nBack at the office, the designer meets with his team of field technicians, CAD specialists, and design assistants to review the project goals. Next, he must secure the client's permission to access the campus and inform its security team which days his field technicians will be on site to begin their work. He then schedules his field technicians to begin the site survey (see “Prepare Your Bidders With an Accurate Scope of Work” in the October issue of EC&M).\nGet out in the field.\nThe field technicians begin their survey and secure new pathway proposals for the new buildings.", "score": 0.825702727, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:dd7a6bb4-286e-44c7-b776-b45d419c1921>", "text": "What do you consider to be the most essential aspect of project success?

What makes this DG double stand out is the prologue to\nOrango, a satirical opera commissioned – somewhat hastily – by Moscow’s Bolshoi Theatre to mark the 15\nth anniversary of the October Revolution. Originally the plan was for a new opera,\nThe Solution, to a libretto by the poet Demyan Bedny. That never materialised, so Count Alexei Tolstoy and Alexander Starchakov were drafted in to help. It was they who suggested\nOrango, for which Shostakovich produced a prologue; but then that project was shelved as well.\nIn 2004 this piano score was discovered among theRead more composer’s papers, and two years later his widow, Irina Antonovna Shostakovich, invited Gerard McBurney to produce a performing version of this 30-minute piece. It was an inspired choice, given the latter’s important work in reconstructing\nHypothetically Murdered (1992). In\nOrango the aim was to flesh out the music using the bits Shostakovich had already plundered from his 1931 ballet\nThe Bolt and orchestrate the rest as idiomatically as possible. The prologue was premiered five years later, and thank goodness someone at DG had the presence of mind to record it.\nOrango is a work steeped in the rich tradition of Russian satire, a genre that spawned some of Shostakovich’s most outrageous creations, from\nThe Nose (1928) to\nMoscow Cheryomushki (1958). Conveniently it’s a celebratory piece, set on the steps of the capital’s grandiose but never-to-be-built Palace of the Soviets; it also ridicules the sycophantic press and prevailing public attitudes, which may explain – in part at least – why the opera was never completed. As for the central character, the humanoid ape Orango, this was a thinly disguised reference to the work of Soviet Professor Ilya Ivanov, a misguided scientist who attempted to cross-breed apes and humans.\nSo much for the gist and genesis of this bizarre opera, but does the prologue work as a stand-alone piece?

It is being orchestrated by the British composer Gerard McBurney and will be premiered in December 2011 by the Los Angeles Philharmonic.\nShostakovich's musical influence on later composers outside the former Soviet Union has been relatively slight, although Alfred Schnittke took up his eclecticism, and his contrasts between the dynamic and the static, and some of André Previn's music shows clear links to Shostakovich's style of orchestration. His influence can also be seen in some Nordic composers, such as Lars-Erik Larsson. Many of his Russian contemporaries, and his pupils at the Leningrad Conservatory, however, were strongly influenced by his style (including German Okunev, Boris Tishchenko, whose 5th Symphony of 1978 is dedicated to Shostakovich's memory, Sergei Slonimsky, and others). Shostakovich's conservative idiom has nonetheless grown increasingly popular with audiences both within and beyond Russia, as the avant-garde has declined in influence and debate about his political views has developed.\n- For a complete list, see List of compositions by Dmitri Shostakovich.\n- See also: Category:Compositions by Dmitri Shostakovich (thematical selection of works by Shostakovich).\nShostakovich's works are broadly tonal and in the Romantic tradition, but with elements of atonality and chromaticism. In some of his later works (e.g., the Twelfth Quartet), he made use of tone rows. His output is dominated by his cycles of symphonies and string quartets, each numbering fifteen. The symphonies are distributed fairly evenly throughout his career, while the quartets are concentrated towards the latter part. Among the most popular are the Fifth and Seventh Symphonies and the Eighth and Fifteenth Quartets. Other works include the operas Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk, The Nose and the unfinished The Gamblers based on the comedy of Nikolai Gogol; six concertos (two each for piano, violin and cello); two piano trios; and a large quantity of film music.", "score": 0.843558729, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:fa5f9752-5739-47a8-b0bf-3af5c1c23162>", "text": "Here are costume maquettes for the production:\nShostakovich was a Wunderkind still in his early-twenties when The Nose was premiered. The crazed cacophony of the score assured a rapturous reception by the Leningrad artistic avant-garde, which was only beginning to feel the repressive power of the still young Stalinist era. A new decade had begun, one that was to become a cesspool of death, reaching its nadir in the Moscow show trials of the mid 30s. Shostakovich’s second opera Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District fell victim to Stalin's ire; he walked out on it during a performance in January of 1936. Two days later the composer was pilloried in Pravda, and the opera was withdrawn. He never wrote another. Shostakovich did not lose his life for his art. But many other artists and public figures did, even once staunch allies of the revolution such as Nicolai Bukharin. At one time powerfully posed at Stalin’s side, Bukharin now gave vent to his helpless pleas of innocence in the face of farcical interrogations by the plenum of the Central Committee on February 26, 1937. In mixed desperation and irony, he quoted the old Russian proverb that denies thievery, “I am not me, the horse is not mine.” It was the response of a sane man to the paranoia and madness around him. Another of his comments, “No one believes in human feelings anymore,” was met with ridicule by the plenum. Bukharin was duly executed.\nThe opera’s absurdist, even Kafkaesque, milieu, soon to become a daily, horrid reality, is anticipated by Shostakovich in the work’s strident score, and it is further adumbrated by William Kentridge in the bizarre, surreal sets and film projections. In a lucid yet brief video, Kentridge explains how all the seemingly disparate visual elements he has constructed blend into the opera’s tapestry, and how the political anger and satire of Gogol’s tale reaches across time and culture from mid -nineteenth century Czarist era, to Stalin, to the brutality of his own South African apartheid culture.", "score": 0.830996871, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:96475e96-7b19-49a5-88e4-e25698c5ca5a>", "text": "That the score is in fact the unfinished first version of the Ninth Symphony was only accepted with certainty upon another astonishing discovery by Ms Digonskaya – this one at Moscow’s Glinka Museum. Among a folder of hitherto unexamined sketches of the composer’s was one whose date, marked 15th January 1945, confirmed what already had been suspected. It’s the kind of corroborating evidence that scholars live and pray for. The fragment from the Archives clearly shows that Shostakovich’s notions of how he would complete a trilogy of war symphonies had drastically changed between the time of its composition and the time he began the 9th Symphony of record in mid-July. Not only does the tone of the music stand in grim contrast to the grinningly mischievous 9th that we know, it defies some of Shostakovich’s most tried conventions. In place of a firmly declared main theme, which usually is stated at the outset of a Shostakovich opening movement, we find a stormy sequence of short reiterative vamps that keep circling round and round each other, as if hopelessly trapped in some hellish storm. The music churns, the vamps at one point becoming accompaniment figures to a second idea screaming in the high winds and later appearing as urgent exhortations in the brass.\nThe listener may wonder how a symphony that begins in such a heightened state of agitation could have possibly advanced. Shostakovich, himself, expressed his doubts to his friend Isaak Glikman. He would, eight years later, recast the second theme as the second subject of the first movement of his Tenth Symphony, as listeners will clearly recognise. The theme also turns up in a sketch for a Violin Sonata, another aborted work of the same period. The episode points to a moment of creative crisis in Shostakovich’s life and casts a fascinating light on his creative processes and working methods.\nPerformances throughout by the Polish RSO and their constituent members are totally dedicated.

But one fact is certain however: some of his older musical works are inspired or even reused parts of the Requiem and vice versa.\nJozsef Acs realized that the introductory bars of the “Dies irae” which have been passed down by handwritten sketches are continued in his last finished opera “Edipo re” (1919). This realization caused Jozsef Acs to start recomposing Leoncavallo’s Requiem. He skillfully connected the dots and the result is an extraordinary piece of work.

Orlov then discusses how the prevailing attitudes and governmental stances are both reflected and challenged in Shostakovich’s more overtly sexual musical works (The Nose, Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk, (Katerina Ismailova) and the Five Satires). Orlov concludes by arguing Shostakovich’s music, “mirrors the short, wasted youth of the Soviet state with its early senility and impotency” (206).\nWhile the reception history of Shostakovich’s music within the United Sates is a topic often alluded to, it is rarely thoroughly investigated. A more insightful understanding of this reception history will help bring nuance to both the historical understanding of his music and the culture in which it was received. In this vein, Terry Klefstad, in ‘A Soviet Opera in America’, argues that understanding reception history of Lady Macbeth in the U.S. will ensure that “modern listeners can begin better to understand their own reactions, both to the opera and to the public image of Shostakovich himself” (207). Klefstad traces the U.S. reception history of Lady Macbeth both prior to and directly after the publication of ‘Muddle Instead of Music’. She divides the critical reception into three genres; those critics who focused on the opera as entertainment, those who focused on the moral and political message of the work and those whose greatest concern was the question of whether the opera is great art. She notes that it was mostly the New York critics who focused on this last point. These critics found the musical aspect of the opera wanting, laying blame for the opera’s shortcomings on the communist message. These same critics were thus confused when the opera’s music was condemned in Pravda for its “bourgeois quality”. Klefstad notes that ‘Muddle Instead of Music’ was a turning point in Americans’ understanding of the role of the Soviet regime in the creation and reception of art.

Fitz-Gerald was also left with the challenge of orchestrating the movement entitledProtest, which exists only in its original piano version. He rose to the task, producing a score that merges seamlessly with the style of the remaining pieces. Practically the entire suite is cast in march time. The opening movement consists of a series of mercurial episodes that culminate in a choral version of the ‘Internationale”. In the ‘Infantry March’, Shostakovich lifts ideas from the March of Fortinbras, from his earlier stage music to Shakespeare’s Hamlet, before taking the piece in its own direction. A totally original and charming march follows.\nThanks to the existence of a published version of the play, there was no difficulty piecing together the sequence of musico-theatrical events in Alexander Afinogenov’s Salute to Spain. The action takes place during the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939), with sympathies offered, of course, for the anti-Fascists.

Here we find one of the earliest, if not the earliest, manifestation of that musical kinship. The highlight of the score can be found in the doleful Spanish-inflected ‘Song of Rosita’, in which an old man tells the sad story of the girl who turned her last bullet on herself in order to avoid Fascist capture. The tune’s heartfelt sorrow prompts Fitz-Gerald to speculate that in it Shostakovich was longing for his girlfriend, then one Elena Konstantinovskaya, who, along with many other Russians, had left for Spain to support the Communist side of the Revolution.

Shostakovich seems to have turned to a word-for-word setting of The Gamblers as a refuge of pure artistic discipline, beginning the day after he completed the Leningrad symphony. He composed most of his Gamblers the following May and June, only to abandon it at the end of 1942. In Testimony, Solomon Volkov reports Shostakovich as saying, “… when I got past ten pages, I stopped. What was I doing? First of all, the opera was becoming unmanageable, but that wasn’t the important thing. The important thing was, who would put on this opera? The subject wasn’t heroic or patriotic. Gogol was a classic, and they didn’t perform his works anyway. And me, I was just dirt to them. They would say that Shostakovich was making fun, mocking art. How could you have an opera about playing cards? And then, The Gamblers had no moral, except perhaps to show how unenlightened people used to be – all they did was play cards and try to cheat one another. They wouldn’t understand that humour was a great thing in itself and that it didn’t need additional morals. … Sometimes now people suggest that I finish the opera, but I can’t. I’m too old, “You can’t enter the same river twice,” as the saying goes.”\nListening to this fragment leads one to agree with the Bolshoi Theatre’s former director Boris Pokrovsky that it was a crime that Shostakovich never completed The Gamblers.

Bernard Haitink's performance of Shostakovich's most tragic symphony had left me largely unmoved on Wednesday evening, so much so that I questioned more closely than in any other concert I have been to whether my initial impression had been the correct one. Many people had clearly been moved by Haitink's performance and one critic thought it the finest performance he had ever heard of the Eighth.\nLargely, my impression of the interpretation remains unchanged. If anything, the second performance was more spacious (in excess of 70 minutes) and again had an inexorable power that only the breadth of tempo employed here can give the work. The first movement again impressed, with its colossal development sustained over a miraculously conceived arc that seemed not only inevitable, but right. It was perhaps easier to appreciate the second time how Haitink draws this movement, almost in a single breath. It is a formidable achievement. The beauty of the string playing opened up fabulously rich textures (staccato passages were contrasted with a broad-toned openness to the string sound) and woodwind and brass were authentically fierce and shrill. The piccolos, in particular, were outstanding - menacing and genuinely frightening. The one undeniable moment of greatness in this performance, in the last movement, occurred just after the final climax when trombones and tuba herald the beginning of the coda.

All of us who admire Shostakovich's music want to know what he was really thinking, and the view from New York – which this very much is – invariably seeks to pin down a linear narrative in Soviet history to explain the music. But what if Shostakovich cannot be reduced to this narrative, for which his admirers in the west have yearned ever since the pleas for him to defect when he visited America, which he flatly refused to do? In the definitive book on Shostakovich's chamber music, David Fanning talks about the \"surface\" of Shostakovich's music being \"overlaid with mirrors\", adding that \"we can never be sure precisely where and at what angle they are placed\".\nIn this endless debate over why Shostakovich joined the Communist party, why he did not defect – over whether he was a party toady or an heroic dissident, tortured genius or wily survivor – it remains possible that none of the descriptions is true, or indeed that they all are. The political labels simply do not stick, nor, one suspects, were they intended by him to do so.\nShostakovich's life was one of haunted ambivalence and conflicting emotions and affiliations. This, at least, is the texture of his music, and this is what ultimately confounds any attempt, including Lesser's, at \"mind-reading\" even such intimate music as the quartets. The Soviet mathematician Lev Mazel likened Shostakovich's work to algebra in which formulae containing several unknowns can have various solutions. More than one thing is happening at once, and not necessarily logically.\nThe Shostakovich we can identify from the evidence personified a kind of existential irony – in doing so he spoke to, and for, millions of Russians.", "score": 4.079728862719041e-05, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:1af8fd9e-44f6-4dd1-abef-af01772607ab>", "text": "The Met: Live in HD - Dmitri Shostakovich's The Nose\n1 p.m. (encore) and 6 p.m. (encore)\nSaturday, November 2, 2013\nRegina A.

A piece relegated by history to a cubicle in the section on musical gimmickry proved a lot more.\nShostakovich was represented by excerpts from his two operas, which contained some of his most daring music. \"The Nose,\" written in 1928, is music by a 22-year-old on a nose-thumbing tear. The opera is seldom encountered today. Shostakovich's hysterical use of Modernism allied to Gogol's story about a civil servant whose nose has a mind of its own is most interesting as an example of where the composer might have been headed. Maybe toward madness.\n\"The Nose's\" most inventive music is in the suite from the opera, which Salonen conducted with what sounded like gleeful recognition. Like Shostakovich, he too was once a precocious, irrepressible musical rebel.\nShostakovich pushed the dramatic envelope further still four years later in \"Lady Macbeth,\" about a repressed young woman's sexual and social liberation that involves murder. She murders to gain freedom and is eventually crushed by the system, which means the opera had a lot to say for its time.\nSalonen chose the orgasmic Act I sex scene, with its famous trombone anticlimax, to conclude the concert.

Yes. When I feel like I’ve got two-thousand people to attend, I’ll move over to Symphony Hall.”\nBy Jonathan Blumhofer\nOdyssey Opera kicks off its fourth season on September 16th with a concert performance of Antonín Dvořák’s grand opera Dmitrij at Boston’s Jordan Hall. Based on the historical record as well as Schiller’s unfinished play Demetrius, the opera follows Boris Godunov’s doomed successor and his fate at the hands of his nemesis, Shuisky. A popular success during Dvořák’s lifetime, Dmitrij fell into neglect after his death. Its American premiere occurred only in 1984 and Odyssey’s single performance will be the first time it’s ever been played in Boston. In anticipation of the event, I spoke with Odyssey’s artistic director (and Boston Modern Orchestra Project head) Gil Rose about the upcoming production, his burgeoning company, and a few related topics of interest. A condensed and edited transcript of our conversation follows below.\nArts Fuse: First off, out of all the obscure operas out there, how did we end up with Dvořák and Dmitrij this year?\nGil Rose: Well, I think it was a matter of going from the general to the specific. We started out thinking about doing something in some kind of Slavic language, like Russian – we haven’t done anything Russian yet – and that led to thinking about doing something maybe in Czech. You know, in this September slot, we’ve always been trying to do these grand operas, so I got to thinking about what grand opera did Smetana write or what grand opera did Dvořák write. And that, eventually, led me to Dmitrij.\nAF: And which version of the opera is Odyssey doing?

No one, Volkov feels, mastered the secret of \"artistic survival in a cruel age\" better than Shostakovich.\nStalin was deeply influenced by Nicholas's declaration of Pushkin as the \"wisest man in Russia,\" and by the great poet's gratitude for the czar's mercy toward him. Stalin always felt that if Pushkin had lived in Stalin's Russia, Stalin would \"not have let him die.\"\nVolkov believes this attitude colored the dictator's attitude toward those he considered masters of their art, such as the writer Maxim Gorky and the theater directors Konstantin Stanislavsky and Vladimir Nemirovich-Danchenko of the Moscow Art Theater. \"He wanted to become their patron, a strict but just adviser, or a friend even - the kind he would have been to Pushkin had he been Stalin's contemporary.\"\nVolkov, who never glosses over Shostakovich's shortcomings, does his best to explain what many consider to be the composer's greatest mistake: joining the Communist Party in 1960. And he writes brilliantly about Shostakovich's music and personality, too. \"Behind Shostakovich's tight facade,\" he notes, \"there was incredible creative will and stubbornness.\"\nVolkov has written an invaluable, extraordinarily fascinating book, a must-read for anyone interested in 20th-century Soviet culture, with all its intrigue, fear, loyalties, betrayals, and, finally, incomparable genius.\n• Susan Miron is a freelance writer and harpist in Newton, Mass.", "score": 2.01408260726892e-08, "source": "sparse"}]}

The verb itself has no direct English translation but the verb хлебать is another verb for eating specific to liquids (like каша or soup) that you slurp. If the metaphorical solution is at the bottom of the bowl, you should eat until you see the bottom and, therefore, the solution.\nNow put the two together and you have the Russian equivalent of ‘you’ve made your bed, now lie in it’: сам заварил кашу, сам и расхлебывай! The expression originated from a kind of lesson in manners which Russian peasants were taught, taking the expression literally: if they went to visit a neighbour and were served каша, they were meant to politely decline, claiming that he needed the food more. By Chekhov’s time it had taken on the idiomatic meaning, he used it in his short story «шведская спичка» (The Swedish Match).\n“Ну, так делай, как сам знаешь, а меня избавь! — пробормотал Чубиков, вставая и отходя к окну. — Не могу!

Some said, “there’s a lot of screaming”, which seemed to fit in with Mr Putin’s KGB background. Such off-beam translations help to make proverbial lore sound mysteriously Russian.\nIt’s quite easy to generate Russian proverbs just by translating English ones badly. Remember to insert the letter Y before each vowel when reading them out: “Sew now or darn later, as we say in Novosibirsk” (A stitch in time); “We have a saying in Oktyabrsky: watch out where you’re jumping” (Look before your leap).\nPig proverbs clearly appeal to Mr Putin, who himself has an inexpressive, slightly inflated appearance, like a new leather sofa from DFS. I’d recommend: “The pig is stabbed in the belly.” This is a variant of the rather blander: “What’s done can’t be undone.” Or (perhaps as a rebuke to lax American security) there’s: “When the gate is open the pigs will run into the corn.” I’m not sure there’s an English equivalent, but it overlaps with: “When the cat’s away…”\nThose piggy sayings all feature in Dutch Proverbs, a picture painted, in a style alarmingly like that of Hieronymus Bosch, by Pieter Brueghel in the 1550s.

For people of Holy Rus their main incentive in life is love for God and for the people. Love, in their understanding, is at the core of the sum of things, and is a manifestation of God Himself. That is also how Grigory Rasputin perceived love, and wrote:\n\"Love is a gold coin that no one can determine the exact value of. It is more precious than anything created by God Himself… However, few comprehend it. While he who gains an insight into the truly priceless value of the \"golden coin of love\" – that person is so wise, he could teach Solomon himself… We all discourse about love, but tend to have heard more of it than actually experienced it personally. We ourselves are at a great distance from Love…\nIf you love, you shall never kill anyone. All commandments are submissive to love; it conceals all the wisdom…\nNo one ever receives love for naught. It shall not come to one who lives a life of repose and plenty. In fact, love tends to seek out the outcasts, who have suffered much, in other words, it chiefly comes to people of vast experience. It is with them one ought to converse about love, while one who has no experience can only distort its true notion.\"\nAnd where there is true love, there can be no room for greed. Here are the words of Grigory Rasputin himself: \"If you do not seek selfish gain for yourself, but instead seek to console people and embrace the Lord with all your spirit, the demons shall shy away from you, and the sick shall be cured. You only need to do everything without filthy lucre. While if you preoccupy yourself with filling your belly, gaining fame and catering to your insatiable greed of money, you shall not receive the rewards neither here on earth, nor in the Heavenly Kingdom …you shall be like a living corpse, as the Gospel says.\"\nGrigory Rasputin referred to hard work as the highest of virtues, and wrote this in his memoirs: \"The Czar himself lives off the hard work of a peasant laborer.

To most sea creatures, however, it's deadly. As climate change heats up ocean temperatures, the future of species such as coral, which provides sustenance and livelihoods to a billion people, is threatened.\nThrough an innovative experiment, Stanford researchers led by biology Professor Steve Palumbi have shown that some corals can – on the fly – adjust their internal functions to tolerate hot water 50 times faster than they would adapt through evolutionary change alone. The findings, published April 24 in Science, open a new realm of possibility for understanding and conserving corals.\n\"The temperature of coral reefs is variable, so it stands to reason that corals should have some capacity to respond to different heat levels,\" said Palumbi, director of Stanford's Hopkins Marine Station and a senior fellow at the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment. \"Our study shows they can, and it may help them in the future as the ocean warms.\"\nCoral reefs are crucial sources of fisheries, aquaculture and storm protection. Overfishing and pollution, along with heat and increased acidity brought on by climate change, have wiped out half of the world's reef-building corals during the past 20 years. Even a temporary rise in temperature of a few degrees can kill corals across miles of reef.\nAmerican Samoa presents a unique case study in how corals might survive a world reshaped by climate change. Water temperatures in some shallow reefs there can reach 95 degrees Fahrenheit, enough to kill most corals. To find out how native corals survive the heat, researchers in Palumbi's lab transplanted colonies from a warm pool to a nearby cool pool and vice versa.\nThe researchers found that, over time, cool-pool corals transplanted to the hot pool became more heat-tolerant.

But they are dying in mass bleaching events, as climate change warms our oceans and breaks down vital relationships between corals and energy-providing algae.\nA new commentary, published in Communications Biology from Nature Research, provides hope that a shift in research focus towards coral immunity will support reef conservation and restoration efforts.\nDr Caroline Palmer, Visiting Research Fellow at the University of Plymouth, has spent more than a decade examining coral health from an immunological perspective.\nIn particular, she has identified coral immune mechanisms and sought to understand what enables some corals to survive while others die. This led Dr Palmer to discover that corals with higher immune defences are less likely to become diseased or to bleach.\nIn her latest work, she expands on this observation, drawing on a theory from insects that explains how corals might coexist with specific microorganisms, as a holobiont, while resisting infection or other disturbances.\nDr Palmer also presents a model of coral susceptibility, whereby investing in immunity enables coral, with its microorganisms, to tolerate more damage before initiating an immune response. This model describes how coral tolerance may vary among corals indicating their susceptibility to disturbances, such as bleaching events.", "score": 0.840387642, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:f7c6a925-6909-45c0-ab0b-25541518793a>", "text": "My work focuses on life histories and physiology of deep corals and characterizing deep reef ecosystems. My most recent project is located in the Atlantic deep-water canyons and includes three research cruises over a period of four years.\nWhat is the most fascinating thing you have ever seen or done?\nDiving in the DSV Alvin (four times) to study hydrothermal vents off the East Pacific Rise was probably the highlight of my field experience, but I have also been fortunate to have used submersibles and remotely operated vehicles to study deep slope communities in the Bahamas; cold seeps in the Gulf of Mexico; and deep coral ecosystems in Alaska, Norway, the southeastern US and Gulf of Mexico.\nAnother experience high on my list was spending eight days in the Aquarius underwater habitat off the coast of Key Largo, Florida. It was eerie and lovely living in a blue world, with muted light and coral reefs outside the windows.\nWhat are the personal rewards of your work?\nI like being at sea and exploring new ecosystems; my absolute favorite thing to do is dive in submersibles and be down on the seafloor seeing the incredible life in the deep ocean. The animals that live in these environments are remarkable and beautiful and often have unusual traits that allow them to survive in a hostile world. I usually bring animals back alive to the laboratory to conduct experiments, which allows us to understand their biology and ecology.\nApart from the exploration and science, I find it rewarding to help protect ecosystems such as deep coral reefs that are vulnerable to human activities. My position at MCI allows me to do this.\nHow does your work benefit the public?\nMy scientific publications hopefully contribute to our understanding of how deep-sea animals live and function. Science also informs management decisions, although not as much as it could at times. My work on the southeastern U.S. deep coral reefs contributed directly to the establishment of a large coral protected area (~ 23,000 square miles) that will prevent the reefs from being damaged by fisheries and energy development.

The algae that live inside of them, zooxanthellae, need sunlight to survive, since the coral animal depends on the zooxanthellae, corals need sunlight to survive.\nClear Water: Clear water is needed for corals to survive because it lets the sunlight in. When the water is opaque the corals will not thrive.\nWarm Water Temperature: Most corals, though not all, require warm waters to grow and survive. Corals general live in water temperature of 68-90°F\nClean Water: Corals are very sensitive to pollution and sediments that can be in the sea. Sediments can create cloudy water conditions which won’t allow for sunlight to get through which will harm the polyps. Corals do not typically do well in environments where there is little sunlight, except for the deep-sea corals. Another issue that may arise is the addition of too many nutrients. An overflow of nutrients in the water can cause things such as algae to grow, in turn taking over the reef. Sediments and pollutants can also cause direct harm to coral tissue.\nSalt Water: Corals require a certain balance between the concentration of salts and water (salinity).\nNutrients: Though zooxanthellae do provide some nutrients, the coral animals still need to receive other sources of nutrition. Corals can also grab passing nutrients (like zooplankton) by using their tentacles to snag passing organisms flowing by.\nCoral Reef Functions:\nProtection: Functions as a form of protection for the shores from harsh waves and storms\nHabitat: Provides shelter and safety for many organisms\nNutrients: Many forms of heterotrophic marine life are supported from the primary production of the coral zooxanthellae. Carbon and nitrogen-fixing is an important part of the marine food chain. Nutrient cycling within the coral polyps is very efficient and contributes to the high production of reefs.\nHow do Corals Reproduce?\nSome species have distinct male or female polyps while other coral can alternate gender. Many coral reef species only reproduce once or twice a year. For some coral that only have single-gender polyps, certain events (i.e. full moon) trigger the polyps to release massive amounts of sperm or eggs that flood into the seas, where the gametes eventually come together.", "score": 0.840150833, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:d53d108b-2c99-45e6-a40f-93cbe8606b7f>", "text": "Because reef-coral have adapted tolerance to a narrow band of environmental conditions, bleaching can occur for a number of reasons, such as ocean acidification, pollution, excess nutrients from run-off, high UV radiation levels, exposure at extremely low tides and cooling or warming of the waters in which the coral reside. Typically these events are very localized in scale and if bleaching is mild, the coral can survive long enough to re-acquire new algal partners. So bleaching in itself is not something new, but mass coral bleaching on the huge scale being observed certainly appears to be, and represents a whole new level of coral reef decline.\nOcean warming is driving mass coral bleaching\nAs coral reefs operate very near to their upper limit of heat tolerance (Glynn & D'Croz 1990), bleaching en masse happens when the surface waters get too warm above their normal summer temperature, and are sustained at this warmer level for too long. The intensity of bleaching corresponds with how high, and how long temperatures are elevated and, as one might expect, the intensity of bleaching affects the rate of survival. Small rises of 1 -2 degree C, for weeks at a time, usually induce bleaching.\nThis episodic ocean warming has been most pronounced worldwide during El-Nino events, when the Pacific Ocean exchanges heat to the atmosphere and surface waters. In recent years though, severe mass bleaching is happening outside of El-Nino because of the \"background\" ocean warming. The huge mass bleaching in the Caribbean in 2005, a non El-Nino year, and again this year is a prime example of this (Eakin 2010) . Evidence connecting warm surface waters and mass coral bleaching has strengthened to the extent that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) has a coral bleaching alert system in place. This alert system accurately forecasts mass coral bleaching based on satellite data of sea surface temperatures.\nHot water + Coral = Dead coral\nSo how does hot water kill coral? It requires both high water temperatures and sunlight. Oxygen is released as waste during photosynthesis and like all chemical processes this is affected by temperature, speeding up as more energy (warmth) is applied. When water temperatures rise too high the protective mechanisms to prevent heat damage, employed by the coral and the algae, are overwhelmed.", "score": 0.83991, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:a4e18468-a991-4340-81ec-ada82dbcc0d5>", "text": "Coral polyps capable of forming giant construction - coral reefs, play a crucial ecological role.

Waller received the grants in order to establish three long-term sites where she will monitor and take coral samples. UMaine diving safety officer Chris Rigaud is accompanying her on the trip.\nResearcher Studying Deep-Sea Corals Scientists have long known that corals are found far beyond shallow, tropical waters. Since the 1800s, researchers on multiyear voyages have collected coral samples from colonies found at much deeper, darker, colder spots in the ocean. In the past two decades, coral has surfaced on trawlers working in more remote fishing grounds in the hunt for an increasingly elusive catch. And that’s when the importance of these invertebrate animals became apparent, and when Rhian Waller began working on her Ph.D. about the reproduction and development of the seldom-seen creatures. Waller’s research now focuses on how environmental factors such as climate change, fishing and oil exploration affect deep-sea coral reproduction, and what effect that altered life cycle could have on the rest of the marine ecosystem. “We’re now beginning to realize that these reefs in the deep sea are very similar to the reefs in shallow water and can be very important to certain fisheries species,” says Waller, a University of Maine assistant research professor in the School of Marine Sciences. “These corals have thousands of associated species that live on and around them so we’re starting to realize they’re important deep-sea ecosystems builders, just like corals in shallow waters.” Earlier this year, Waller received a more than $78,000 RAPID Grant from the National Science Foundation and a $30,000 National Geographic Society award to establish three long-term monitoring sites in Chile where she will sample corals for reproductive ecology studies.

The group includes the important reef builders that inhabit tropical oceans, which secrete calcium carbonate to form a hard skeleton. Coral reefs form some of the most diverse ecosystems on Earth. They occupy less than one tenth of one percent of the world ocean surface, yet they provide a home for about twenty-five percent of all marine species, including fish, molluscs, worms, and crustaceans. Paradoxically, coral reefs flourish even though they are often surrounded by ocean waters that provide few nutrients. University of Miami (UM) Rosenstiel School of Marine & Atmospheric Science scientist Chris Langdon and colleagues have developed a new tool to monitor coral reef vital signs. By accurately measuring their biological pulse, scientists can better assess how climate change and other ecological threats impact coral reef health worldwide.\nDuring a March 2009 experiment at Cayo Enrique Reef in Puerto Rico, the team tested two new methods to monitor biological productivity. They compared a technique that measures changes in dissolved oxygen within a chamber that encloses an area of water above the reef with one that measures the flux of dissolved oxygen across the turbulent boundary layer above an unconfined portion of the seafloor.\nBy measuring dissolved oxygen production and consumption rates, scientists were able to monitor the balance between the production of new organic matter by the corals and algae and the consumption of that organic matter by the reef's heterotrophs, which are essential to assessing the health of coral reef ecosystems.\nA combination of these methods is a valuable tool for assessing and studying the effects of climate change on coral reef health, according to the authors.\nCoral reefs are fragile ecosystems, partly because they are very sensitive to water temperature. They are under threat from climate change, ocean acidification, overuse of reef resources, and harmful land-use practices, including urban and agricultural runoff and water pollution, which can harm reefs by encouraging excess algae growth.\nSeaweed and algae proliferate given adequate nutrients and limited grazing by herbivores. Coral die if surrounding water temperature changes by more than a degree or two beyond their normal range or if water salinity drops.

Although methoprene is unstable in sunlight, it is an effective indoor treatment. Pyriproxyfen sprays, available to pest control professionals under the trade names Archer™ and Nylar™, can be applied both indoors and outdoors. Pyriproxyfen controls both immature and adult fleas. Indoors, treat pet loafing and sleeping areas, and in and under nearby furniture. Outdoors, treat only flea breeding sites such as bedding areas, the ground under decks and shrubbery, and wherever pets spend a lot of time. Well maintained lawns in sunny sites are unlikely to harbor many fleas. Suitable consumer products for indoor and outdoor treatments are listed in Table 1.\nFollow-up. Because flea pupae are hard to kill with insecticides, an additional follow-up treatment is usually needed 7 to 10 days after the first application. When using short-residual insecticides such as pyrethrins, two or three follow-up sprays at 5- to 10-day intervals may be required.\nBiological and Mechanical Controls\nFire ants and other predatory insects eat flea larvae but they do not control fleas completely. Several kinds of predatory nematodes (a type of microscopic worm) are sold for outdoor flea control, but their effectiveness has not been well tested. Studies suggest that nematodes work best in sandy soils. Irrigate with 1/4 to 1/2 inch of water before and after application. This prolongs nematode survival and helps them move through the soil in search of flea larvae.\nSeveral kinds of flea traps are available from pest control companies and pet stores. The most effective designs use a special green light that blinks occasionally to simulate the shadow of a passing host. Most attract fleas to a sticky card, where they are trapped. Place traps near pet beds and loafing areas for best control. By themselves, traps are unlikely to solve most flea problems; however, they can be a useful part of an integrated flea control program for your home.\nDon’t wait until fleas get out of hand. Begin your flea control program early for best results.

Centipedes are usually brownish, flattened, and elongated insects having many body segments. They have one pair of legs attached to most of these body segments. Centipedes differ from millipedes in that millipedes have two pairs of legs on most segments and bodies which are not flattened. Centipedes are between one and six inches in length and the house centipede is between one and two inches long.\nCentipedes usually live outdoors in damp areas such as under leaves, stones, boards, tree bark, or in mulch around outdoor plantings. If they are around the foundation of the house, they may wander inside. Larger centipedes can bite that may cause light swelling. Most centipedes are active at night. In the summer, they will lay 35 eggs or more in or on the soil. Newly hatched centipedes have four pairs of legs. During subsequent molts, the centipede progressively increases the number of legs until becoming an adult.

This drone is stiff enough to carry its own weight and withstand propeller thrust while airborne, but becomes flexible upon impact to absorb shock and reduce damage. The resilience comes from a unique combination of stiff and elastic layers, with an elastomer membrane sandwiched between rigid plates. This technology could lead to applications beyond drones, such as soft-touch grippers. Origami principles are also being applied to create high-performance, flexible lithium-ion batteries and deployable structures for space exploration.

Filipov’s previous research on folded structures focuses on mechanics of origami tubular structures.\nAnalytical models for thin-sheet structures\nWe have improved a model for the analysis of origami structures that consist of flat panels interconnected by a pattern of prescribed fold lines. This bar and hinge model, first introduced by Schenk and Guest (2011) can capture the fundamental behaviors of thin folded sheet structures. The model consists of three components: (1) elastic bar elements that simulate the stretching and shear stiffness thin panels; (2) rotational hinges that simulate folding of the panels; and (3) rotational hinges that simulate folding along the more flexible prescribed fold lines. We have made the model scalable, and have incorporated material characteristics such as the elastic modulus, Poisson’s ratio, and thickness of the thin sheet. Although this model is not as as accurate as a detailed finite element (FE) model it provides several useful advantages. The model is easy to implement, easy to use, it provides insightful results, and it is faster than FE analyses. The efficiency of the model makes it suitable for extensions to parametric studies, optimization or various specialized analyses.\nDeployable coupled tube structures\nWe have explored a variety of origami tube systems and assemblages. The basic type of tube is constructed by placing two symmetric Miura-ori sheets together (see Tachi 2009). The tube is rigid and flat foldable meaning it can fully unfold from a flattened state with deformations occurring only at the fold lines. We used eigenvalue and structural cantilever analysis to investigate and compare different geometries of tubes and coupled tube systems. The “zipper”-coupled tube system (shown on the left) yields an unusually large eigenvalue band-gap that represents a unique difference in stiffness between deformation modes. The structure has only one flexible mode through which it can deploy, yet it is significantly stiffer for all other bending and twisting type modes. The deployment motion is permitted by the flexible bending the thin sheet along the prescribed fold lines, however all other modes require the significantly stiffer stretching and shear of the thin sheet. The zipper-couped tubes have the advantages of deployable origami, but also the stiffening effect that is common in cellular/corrugated structures and materials.", "score": 0.861417413, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:ca198605-27bc-4e32-a371-da8dc99a700d>", "text": "An origami-like drone developed at EPFL is flexible enough to absorb shocks without breaking before returning to its initial shape.

However, there is a lack of understanding of how imperfections influence the mechanical behaviour of origami-based metamaterials, which, in practice, are inevitable. For conventional materials, imperfection plays a profound role in shaping their behaviour. Thus, this paper investigates the influence of small random geometric imperfections on the nonlinear compressive response of the representative Miura-ori, which serves as the basic pattern for many metamaterial designs. Experiments and numerical simulations are used to demonstrate quantitatively how geometric imperfections hinder the foldability of the Miura-ori, but on the other hand, increase its compressive stiffness. This leads to the discovery that the residual of an origami foldability constraint, given by the Kawasaki theorem, correlates with the increase of stiffness of imperfect origami-based metamaterials. This observation might be generalizable to other flat-foldable patterns, in which we address deviations from the zero residual of the perfect pattern; and to non-flat-foldable patterns, in which we would address deviations from a finite residual.\n|Original language||English (US)|\n|Journal||Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences|\n|State||Published - Sep 1 2020|\nAll Science Journal Classification (ASJC) codes\n- Physics and Astronomy(all)\n- mechanical metamaterials\n- origami-based metamaterial", "score": 0.858989775, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:35983f04-0c9d-4afa-b4db-4c06b9f6b929>", "text": "Extensions from metamaterials to deployable architecture\nOrigami sheets and origami tubes can be coupled, combined, and arranged in a variety of methods to form new geometries and structures.

For example, the cubic cellular assemblage (shown top right) consists of zipper and aligned coupling, and has both space filling properties and the enhanced stiffness of the zipper tubes. This assemblage can have a variable asymmetrical stiffness depending on its configuration. Similarly, it is be possible to couple different geometries of tubes.

For example, origami structures formed by folding paper have good foldability, but they cannot withstand large loads, while origami structures made of metal have excellent load-bearing capacity but cannot be folded.\nTo address this problem, the joint research team of Associate Professor Qi Ge from the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) and Professor Yang Lu from the University of Hong Kong (HKU) has proposed a design and fabrication strategy that can make origami structures with both foldability and large load capacity.

The geometrical arrangement of folds allows a folding mechanism of great efficiency and is often derived from the buckling patterns of simple geometries, like a plane or a cylinder (e.g., Miura-ori and Yoshimura folding pattern) (Wu et al., 2007, \"Optimization of Crush Characteristics of the Cylindrical Origami Structure,\" Int.

Here, we interest ourselves to the conception of foldable/unfoldable structures for civil engineering and architecture. In those disciplines, the need for folding efficiency comes along with the need for structural efficiency (stiffness); for this purpose, we will explore nondevelopable foldable/unfoldable structures: those structures exhibit potential stiffness because, when unfolded, they cannot be flattened to a plane (nondevelopability).", "score": 3.975976377033369e-06, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:265b4375-a316-4d86-8a0d-f33758e046ea>", "text": "This article presents a soft cylindrical multistable origami structure based on “bendy straws,” consisting of multiple conical frusta mimicking the structure of a flexible drinking straw. These frusta are connected in such a way that the whole structure is axially multistable, having a stable compressed state in which its smallest frustum is collapsed. The bendy straw structure can also be modified so that the smallest frustum collapses only partially, keeping the structure in a bent state. We studied the geometry of a similar structure consisting of polygonal frusta instead of conical ones and used this geometry to design a nonrigidly foldable origami pattern folding into a similar origami bendy straw structure. Most of the origami structures presented so far have been modeled from rigidly foldable origami patterns: These origami structures do not rely on local deformations of the sheet and cannot use it to their advantage, whereas the nonrigid origami structure presented here features multistability.

How “static foot structure” reflects “dynamic foot function” continues to be an important topic.\nWhen I say “static assessment” I mean the assessments used to evaluate foot characteristics under conditions that are not real world tasks. So, looking at the foot during standing, manipulating a non-weight bearing foot to look at ranges of joint motion, or asking someone to rise up onto their toes. What these have in common is that we use them to infer how that foot behaves under more real world conditions, such as walking, running, landing and so on. These real world tasks are what I mean by “dynamic” foot function.\nBut should the “static foot” ever reflect the “dynamic foot”? There is a good reason why it should not and to explain why we need to go back to my earlier definition of the foot (see here).\n“…the foot is a complex matrix of at least 11 biological tissues [cut]… that responds to external loads through the symbiotic relationship between the motor control system and tissue properties. [cut]…at no time is the foot ever a purely mechanical structure, other laws are always at play.”\nWhat this means is that the foot is a very adaptable structure. It responds to the external loads applied to it and when these vary so too does its response. When external loads are applied in static tests, such as standing, you get one response, when you apply different external loads during walking, running, landing etc., you get a different response. It follows that even two “static” assessments might not correlate well, because the forces in a weight bearing and a non weight bearing assessment are entirely different, even if both are “static”.\nLet’s go one step further. The principle underlying the use of static assessments to infer dynamic foot function is that structure reflects function, and of course this is true. However, I believe it is wrong to say that we are assessing foot structure when we undertake a static assessment. The structures are the bones, ligaments, muscles and so on, and we are not assessing these. What we are assessing is the functional response of the foot (and therefore the interplay between all the structures) to the loads applied.", "score": 2.4790232365586763e-09, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:d7118aa4-f064-4455-b785-d70acd48349d>", "text": "NSK is a global network offers many kinds of bearings.

They signal through heterotrimeric G proteins, which activate a number of effectors, such as enzymes and ion channels. Increasing evidence suggest that GPCR signaling cascades are organized in dynamic micro- and nanodomains both on the cell surface and inside cells. However, direct observation of such domains has been hampered by the insufficient spatiotemporal resolution of conventional biochemical and optical methods.\nThe central hypothesis of this proposal is that the organization of receptor–G protein–effector cascades in micro-/nanodomains, likely through intervention of scaffold proteins and the cytoskeleton, is crucial for achieving efficient and specific signaling. We anticipate that such an organization provides an additional and important level of regulation. To verify this hypothesis, we plan to use high-end optical methods such as single-molecule microscopy and super-resolution imaging (dSTORM) to directly observe with few nanometer and millisecond precision the localization of receptors, G proteins and effectors and to investigate the role of the cytoskeleton in organizing GPCR signaling cascades.\nSpecifically, we will focus on three prototypical GPCRs, i.e. β2-adrenergic (β2-AR), α2A-adrenergic (α2A-AR) and metabotropic γ-aminobutyric acid (GABAB) receptors, which play fundamental roles in the regulation of neurotransmission and cardiovascular functions, are coupled to different G proteins and, as we have recently shown, possess distinct and peculiar spatial arrangements on the surface of living cells.

Thus, 40% of drugs in current use targets GPCRs for the treatment of various diseases including heart failure (e.g -adrenoceptors), peptic ulcer (histamine receptors), prostatic carcinoma (gonadorelin receptors), hypertension (adrenergic and angiogensin receptors), pain (opioid receptors) and bronchial asthma (2-adrenoceptors). All GPCRs share a seven-transmembrane (TM) -helical structure with an extracelllar N-terminus and an intracellular C-terminus (2). Upon agonist binding on the extracellular side of GPCRs, TM segments and intracellular side of the receptor undergo conformational changes, which induce the coupling and activation of the heterotrimeric G proteins (3). The heterotrimeric G protein is composed of G, G and G subunits, and G subunit contains GDP in its inactive resting state (4). Upon activation by GPCR, GDP is released from G subunit and is replaced by GTP, which dissociates G subunits from G and activates AG-1478 kinase inhibitor G proteins (4). The activated G proteins go back to the resting state by hydrolyzing a phosphate group from GTP converting it to GDP (4). There are 21 G, 6 G and 12 G subunits identified in human, and G proteins are typically grouped into four main classes (Gs, Gi/o, Gq/11, and G12/13) depending on the similarity of G subunits (5).

Specifically, GPR120 has collected attention due to its potential function in the legislation of several inflammation-related diseases such as for example diabetes and weight problems (21, 26C31). It’s been reported that eating n-3 essential fatty acids inhibit bone tissue reduction in ovariectomized mice due to their inhibitory results on osteoclast development (32). Some research demonstrated the inhibitory ramifications of DHA on osteoclast development and activity research give some understanding into the ramifications of DHA on osteoclast development, however, the consequences of DHA on osteoclast development stay unclear. Furthermore, the consequences of DHA through GPR120 on osteoclast development never have been investigated.

When considering the large repertoire of GPCRs, and thus the multitude of potential oligomers that can be formed, a challenging task consists in identifying the specificity and the physiological relevance of the partners, and the functional consequences of these associations. By far, the GPCR-A/rhodopsin family has been the most extensively studied, and data collected indicate that the consequences of oligomerization may be detected at the level of both physiological and pharmacological ligand recognition, in signaling properties as well as at desensitization and internalization levels.

Drugs that activate G protein-coupled receptors are classified as either agonists or partial agonists. To study the mechanism whereby these different classes of activating ligands modulate receptor function, we directly monitored ligand-induced conformational changes in the G protein-coupling domain of the beta(2) adrenergic receptor. Fluorescence lifetime analysis of a reporter fluorophore covalently attached to this domain revealed that, in the absence of ligands, this domain oscillates around a single detectable conformation. Binding to an antagonist does not change this conformation but does reduce the flexibility of the domain. However, when the beta(2) adrenergic receptor is bound to a full agonist, the G protein coupling domain exists in two distinct conformations. Moreover, the conformations induced by a full agonist can be distinguished from those induced by partial agonists. These results provide new insight into the structural consequence of antagonist binding and the basis of agonism and partial agonism.\nView details for Web of Science ID 000169800700001\nView details for PubMedID 11320077\nThe effect of pH on beta(2) adrenoceptor function - Evidence for protonation-dependent activation\nJOURNAL OF BIOLOGICAL CHEMISTRY\n2000; 275 (5): 3121-3127\nThe majority of extracellular physiologic signaling molecules act by stimulating GTP-binding protein (G-protein)-coupled receptors (GPCRs).

P2Y2 receptors increase intracellular calcium, as a result of an activation of the phospholipase C pathway, involving the production of inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate. Diacylglycerol is also produced during this process which activates protein kinase C. In order to investigate further the mechanism of P2Y2 receptor activation and desensitization, four mutants were created within the cytoplasmic tail of the P2Y2 receptor and expressed in 1321N1 human astrocytoma cells that did not previously contain P2Y2 receptors. The cells expressing the altered receptors were then tested in order to determine the mobilization of intracellular free calcium. The concentration response curves of intracellular free calcium increased in all four sets of P2Y2 mutant cell lines, leading to signaling and desensitization similar to that found with the wild type receptor. As a result, these particular locations within the cytoplasmic tail of the P2Y2 receptor are not vital to the activation of the phospholipase C pathway.

Future studies will address these points.\nAnother question of future investigations will be the role of the P4 metabolite, and neurosteroid, 5α-pregnan-3α-ol-20-one (3α,5α-THP), for these effects. P4’s effects in the VTA are dependent upon formation and activity of 3α,5α-THP in the VTA (reviewed in Frye and Walf, 2009). 3α,5α-THP is devoid of affinity for PRs, and can exert rapid, non-classical actions involving neurotransmitter receptors and their downstream signaling cascades to facilitate lordosis (Frye and Walf, 2009). In the VTA, oxytocin receptors are another membrane-bound protein that may be a target for progestogens’ actions for lordosis, involving G-protein-initiated intracellular signaling cascades. In support, oxytocin receptors are G-protein coupled receptors (Shojo and Kaneko, 2000), and have been localized to the midbrain of rats (Ostrowski, 1998). In vitro studies demonstrate that P4 alters oxytocin-stimulated calcium signaling in a G-proteindependent manner (Burger et al., 1999). It may be that P4-mediated changes in calcium signaling are due to direct interactions between P4 and oxytocin receptors. In support, physiological levels of P4 reduce the ligand binding capacity of the oxytocin receptors transfected into cells by more than 50% (Zingg et al., 1998). In this study, P4 also reduced oxytocin-induced inositol phosphate production and intracellular calcium mobilization by 85 and 90%, respectively. Given the essential role of 3α,5α-THP in the midbrain VTA in mediating lordosis, whether the mechanisms for these effects involve SHBG and oxytocin is of great interest.\nIn summary, the present data demonstrate that SHBG and oxytocin in the VTA are likely targets of progestogens in the VTA for lordosis.

Moreover, they can protect the land by serving as a buffer between the land and the ocean.\nIn fact, estuaries have protected many coastal towns from flooding. An estuary can be surrounded by swamps, coral reefs, and beaches. During dry seasons, there is normally not much freshwater coming down from the rivers. This can result in the estuary being very salty.\nMoreover, during dry seasons, there is a lot of evaporation from the estuary and this further increases its saltiness.\nEstuary biome temperatures vary with estuaries and seasons. The temperature in Alan estuary in England, for example, ranges from 13 to 17 degrees Celsius or 55 to 63 degrees Fahrenheit. Also, the temperature in an estuary also affects the health of the biome.\nFor example, when the temperature of an estuary goes up, the level of dissolved oxygen, which is essential for life in the ecosystem, drops. In fact, a rise in temperature of about 14 degrees Celsius can result in the drop of dissolved oxygen amount by about half mg per liter.\nIt is also worth noting that different species of flora and fauna are able to adapt to the fluctuating temperatures of the estuary based on their innate biological systems.\nThe fact that salt dominates the estuary biome, means that most plants cannot survive in that environment. Some plants grow further back on the shore to enjoy the fluctuating conditions of freshwater and saltwater. Plants that grow in estuary biome must be adapted to tolerate:\n- Fluctuating salinity levels\n- Varying exposure to wind and sunlight\n- Strong currents and storm waves\n- Low levels of oxygen in muddy soils\nExamples of estuary biomes plants include:\n- Smooth cordgrass – This plant thrives in salt marshes and is an important plant species in the estuary biome as it releases high volumes of organic material into the ecosystem upon decomposition.\n- Seagrass – This small, dark green plant with ribbon-like leaves thrives in sandy silts.

The areas close to the ocean are flooded by high tide daily. A salt marsh is divided into two main regions, low salt marsh and high salt marsh. The low salt marsh is found from the area of low tide to the area of high tide. The main plant found in the low salt marsh is cord grass (Spartina alterniflora). The high salt marsh ranges from the high tide line to the highest spring tide. In this area the plants are more terrestrial than aquatic. Examples of plants found in the high salt marsh are hay grass (Spartina patens), saltwort grass (Salicornia sp.), and spike grass (Districhlis spicata) (Pinet).\nSalt marshes provide a protected area away from many predators where many organisms can grow and develop into adults. A salt marsh provides humans with areas for pelt hunting, fishing and other recreational activities. Salt marshes also help protect the inland land areas from natural disasters such as hurricanes.\nThe future of the salt marsh is being environmentally threatened by strong hurricanes and a rise in sea level. Humans are also intentionally and unintentionally threatening the salt marshes. Many marshes have been drained and filled for the planting of various crops, the building of homes and industrial buildings, and cleared to limit the insect population. Many marshes are impounded to control the water depth, salinity, nutrients, and gas levels. Pollution from many sources is another large threat to salt marshes, causing a decline in the productivity of salt marshes (Chabreck).\nSome destruction to salt marshes has been minimized through federal and state laws.

This natural process causes some waters within the Pescadero Marsh to become anoxic. Anoxic waters are areas of sea water or fresh water that are depleted of dissolved oxygen. Anoxic conditions result from several factors; for example, stagnation conditions, density stratification, inputs of organic material, and strong thermoclines; all of which are dangers present in the Pescadero Marsh. When oxygen is depleted, bacteria first turn to the second-best electron acceptor, which in sea water is nitrate. Denitrification occurs, then after reducing some other minor elements, the bacteria will turn its attention to reducing sulfate. The bacterial production of sulfide starts in the sediments, where the bacteria find suitable substrates, and then expands into the water column. This is what causes that strong “rotten egg” odor emanating from the marsh. It is so strong, that you can smell it as you drive along the marsh on Hwy 1 and along Pescadero Road. If the wind is right it could be smelled all the way into the town of Pescadero, which is [two] miles inland. When the sandbar breaks and these conditions exist all that anoxic water starts to funnel out into the ocean and when the bottom matter is stirred up it creates a very toxic environment. The fish are suffocated and die immediately.\nAccording to geologic record, anoxic events happening in the past may have caused mass extinctions.\nStudies have also shown that when State Parks projects were done in the 1990’s, it changed the natural way the sandbar opens and closes. Many levees were altered and even built by State Parks. They also installed a series of tidal gates allowing salt water to enter the north pond, which after only one year became inoperable because of rust. The tidal gates were never fixed and are still inoperable to this day as they remain rusted open.

Ecologists warn that saltwater marshes from Maine to Connecticut are suddenly and inexplicably dying, leaving behind land resembling honeycombs, Swiss cheese or an eroded desert landscape.\nFew scientists can explain it or recommend what to do. Even skeptics concede something unusual is happening.\n\"It's something that people who have spent their entire careers working in salt marshes have never seen before,\" said Stephen Smith, a plant ecologist who works in Cape Cod for the National Park Service. \"There's no precedent for it.\"\nSalt marshes are wetlands dominated by plant life sheltered from surf and capable of living where coastal waters fluctuate. Losing a marsh means eliminating a habitat for hundreds of fish, birds, shellfish and mammals and destroying a buffer capable of weakening a hurricane's destructive surge.\nSouthern New England has lost between 50 to 70 percent of its saltwater marshes since white settlers arrived in the 17th century, according to one study. Marshes can migrate to keep up with changing sea levels, but modern development has caged them in.\n\"There's nowhere for it go to go,\" Smith said. \"So, if it's dying, we're kind of worried we may lose that habitat forever.\"\nLife on even a healthy marsh is a bit tenuous. Plants serve as the glue holding everything together. Their roots prevent erosion by anchoring the thin soil. When plants die, they decompose and add nutrients to the peat.\n\"Salt marshes (are) structured by the plants,\" said Scott Warren, a botanist who studies tidal wetlands at Connecticut College. \"Take away the plants, you don't have it.\"\nExactly what is killing those plants remains unknown.

The Pond and its surrounding salt marshes are a resource situated between the residents of Rhode Island and the cold waters of the Atlantic Ocean, serving as a natural buffer to storms.\nSeveral years ago, in 2014, scientists studying the area observed that the salt marshes at Ninigret Pond were starting to drown, essentially transforming them into mud flats. Funding from the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation’s Hurricane Sandy Coastal Resiliency Fund made it possible for the Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council to step in and work to restore and enhance the existing salt marsh in an effort to bring back native species as well as protect the community from coastal flooding.\nThe CRMC, a Rhode Island state agency, and its partners developed a plan to use sediment from the nearby Charlestown Breachway to build up the elevation of the marsh to create a new surface to restore the coastal salt pond.\nCaitlin Chaffee, Project Manager for the Rhode Island CRMC, said the project “started to look a whole lot worse at first, before it started to look better.”\n“This is a new technique, a new approach to marsh restoration for us,” Chaffee said. “There were a lot of hurdles we faced in permitting.”\nThe contractor for the project, JF Brennan Company, dredged the waterway and deposited the dredged materials on the marsh throughout December 2016 into January 2017. They then spread the materials out over the marsh and leveled the new surface.\n“In the past, when we think about human impact on marshes we are talking about marshes that have been filled and we want to remove the filling,” Chaffee said. “We want to undo the human impacts.

But what happens to the vegetation if storm surges occur more frequently or become more severe in the course of climate change? And how will this impact coastal erosion?\nAn international research team is currently exploring these questions in a unique experiment in the Large Wave Flume at the Coastal Research Centre, a joint facility of Leibniz University Hannover and TU Braunschweig. The research results could illustrate the consequences of climate change for the invaluable role of tidal marsh in providing protection against coastal erosion.\nSalt marshes occur on shallow coasts influenced by tides. They provide a habitat for adapted plants and animals, protect the coast, and contribute to climate protection as they store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. However, if storm surges occur more frequently due to climate change, the system might become imbalanced and lose its protective function for the coast.\nTo date, researchers can neither predict the resistance of tidal marshes against more frequent or more severe flooding nor what kind of storm surges might destroy them. Salt marshes are considerably more complex than dunes or sand beaches. On the one hand, they contain large quantities of silt and loam, resulting in “sticky” soil. On the other hand, their protective vegetation is more or less pronounced.\nWithin the framework of the Hydralab+ project RESIST (“Response of Ecologically-mediated Shallow Intertidal Shores and their Transitions to extreme hydrodynamic forcing”), an international team will address these issues by analysing the effects of heavy swells on seedlings and fully-grown plants of different species, as well as the effect of soil composition on coastal erosion. Over a period of three weeks, researchers at the Large Wave Flume in Hannover will expose various salt marsh plants as well as sediment samples to large waves and storm surges.\nIn March 2018, researchers collected plants such as cordgrass and sea club-rush in the Netherlands. Subsequently, they planted them in wooden boxes, which were then positioned in five different soil zones of the Large Wave Flume.\nFor instance, in one zone the team will study the effects of storm surges in summer and winter.

DOI: 10.1111/ele.12721.\nDrought has become increasingly prevalent in many parts of the world, but how it will affect ecosystems is often poorly understood. In the Yellow River Delta scientists discovered that another factor, natural enemies, hinder the ability of plants to recover from drought.\nIn 2011, China’s Yellow River was under an extreme drought, turning many salt marshes in the river delta into desolate wasteland. The government attempted replanting the marshes but was unsuccessful. A team of researchers worked throughout the drought period to investigate the causes behind the mass death of the salt marshes and find ways to manage droughts more effectively. They uncovered a hidden culprit neglected by the government — natural enemies.\nScientific models cannot accurately predict how long drought recovery will take. More plants die from drought and take longer to recover than climate and precipitation models assume. A team of researchers led by Qiang He at Beijing Normal University set up a six-year multi-faceted study in the Yellow River Delta to understand this delay in salt marsh recovery. The researchers suspect that a range of natural enemies — i.e., grazers and diseases — were the cause of the delay. They tested how plant enemies exacerbated drought effects and published the research results in Ecology Letters.\nThe main plant that grows in the region is seepweed (Suaeda salsa), a plant whose stunningly neon red is so unusual that every year it draws many tourists to where the Yellow River meets the sea. Enemies to the seepweed include grazers, most notably Helice tientsinensis, a local crab species. To understand how the grazer was affecting seepweed, the scientists built multiple exclosures, areas enclosed by fencing which blocked the small leaf-eating crab from entering. Over the period of the drought and drought recovery, the researchers measured the amount of healthy vegetation in both the grazed and non-grazed areas.\nBy excluding crabs from the area only after the drought, He and his team saw the plants inside crab exclosures recovered quickly.", "score": 0.822940767, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:1efedb86-109d-4e39-b086-db62bbd7912d>", "text": "Tell us how you have used this marsh grass.", "score": 0.822220385, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:5444ce51-05b1-4dae-a5c7-fd5966480016>", "text": "We have a very convenient option on the boat, a deck wash hose at the front of the boat by the anchor windlass, which can spray either fresh water or salt water by adjusting a valve.

Undoubtedly, more data is being captured and analysed today than we ever imagined. Breakthrough technologies such as cloud computing, big data, and the Internet of Things (IoT) have matured rapidly and opened up previously unimagined possibilities that will revolutionise how we approach and provide healthcare. Research suggests that the digital health market is expected to reach US$206 billion by 2020, driven primarily by mobile phones, medical devices and the wireless health market.\nThe digital future of healthcare includes 3 scenarios:\n- Digital hospitals – Hospitals will become truly paperless and digital from back office to patient flow management, to electronic medical records.\n- Personalised patient-centred healthcare – We will witness the transformation to “healthcare made for me,” where empowered patients receive anticipatory services personalised to their own needs.\n- Hyperconnected healthcare: Every patient, healthcare professional, provider and machine will be hyperconnected, changing established rules for healthcare channels and driving collaboration.\nVital signs observation is a key part of the “chain of prevention” required to avoid deterioration, cardiac arrest and mortality, however, vital sign data presents a problem. Vital signs are not currently being collected in real time, and manual transcription leaves data open to error. The majority of vital sign records are taken during the day, so a lack of data at night risks missing possible patient deterioration during this time. A study found that nearly all early warning charts for patients who had overnight clinical concerns were incomplete, with 64% having one or more observations omitted. Current healthcare systems lack continuous, real-time vital sign monitoring.\nVital sign instabilities are linked to an increased likelihood of death or readmission. Vital sign instability within 24 hours of being discharged from hospital has been linked to an almost 40% increase in likelihood of death or readmission within 30 days. Premature discharge, as indicated by the presence of unresolved clinical instabilities at the time of discharge, is associated with higher post-discharge mortality and readmission rates.\nEarly warning scores are imperative in identifying deteriorating patients. Recognition and treatment of vital sign instabilities through early warning scores may also provide an easily actionable target to help providers and hospitals reduce adverse events post-discharge.", "score": 0.006561557858038253, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:a1b799af-3555-4893-8b8a-6af120a05683>", "text": "Behind the scenes of the creation of Rouge Sur Mesure Powered by Perso\nInterview with Guive Balooch, Global Vice President of L’Oréal’s Technology Incubator\n1. What was the starting point of Rouge Sur Mesure?\nThe development of Rouge Sur Mesure was informed by the L'Oréal Technology Incubator’s successful launches of award-winning products. From this previous work, we knew consumers needed a higher level of personalization with products – especially in the last several years – and we worked tirelessly to perfect the Perso system. Rouge Sur Mesure allows users, for the first time, to have personalized beauty experiences at home.\n2. There have been many attempts to personalize beauty products - what makes this invention the real deal?\nRouge Sur Mesure took more than five years to develop, with the work and input from dozens of beauty, technological and innovation experts, and features various technological feats, including a patented motor system, of which I’m particularly proud. This system is located at the top of the device, which moves and compresses the formula from the cartridges at the base of the machine in an upward motion [versus other devices which push it down] to the dispensing tray above for a clean application. It’s a totally unique feature. 3. As a part of your creative process, you started by looking at the needs of the consumer - the YSL woman. How have these needs changed over time?\nThe beauty industry is rapidly evolving, and we constantly have to be thinking ahead. With Rouge Sur Mesure specifically, a huge challenge was inclusivity and ensuring the device could produce enough shades to meet the myriad skin tones & cultural preferences of consumers. Another challenge was making the experience the most consumer-centric as possible for lipstick lovers that are not necessarily used to using technology. The third challenge was technological: accommodating all types of phones, creating smart packaging that was safe and hygienic, as well as creating a connected system, which dispensed formula up versus down. We successfully worked through these challenges and created a product and system that was truly inclusive with excellent performance.", "score": 0.006412114252436201, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:3a600a61-2b2e-4cc6-8540-3d23c921f77f>", "text": "The 10 main Municipalities of Central Greece, which represent the capital of each one of the 10 counties in Greece and belonging to the Region of Central Greece, adopted in 2008 a strategy to unite their forces in order to adequately meet and serve local citizen and local authority needs.\nThe strategy adopted is a citizen/visitor – local authority centric strategy and is based on the communications, information, and infotainment industry.

First, you have to find the ideal program that will provide the proper training to become a skilled professional. And given that some states do require that ultrasound techs be either licensed or certified, depending on where you will practice you may also need to be prepared to pass a licensing or certification exam. So it’s extremely important that you investigate each college so that you can evaluate and compare your choices. But just where does one begin? Many individuals will begin by looking for schools that are within travelling distance of their homes and then by comparing tuition. Certainly cost and location must be taken into account when arriving at a decision, but there are other significant factors as well. For example, if the ultrasound technician schools are accredited or if they offer internship programs. These and additional qualifiers will be addressed more in detail later in this post. But first, let’s discuss what an ultrasound tech does and the degrees and online training programs that are available.\nSonogram Tech Work Description\nThere are several acceptable titles for ultrasound techs (technicians). They are also called ultrasound technologists, sonogram techs, and diagnostic medical sonographers (or just sonographers). Regardless of name, they all have the same primary job description, which is to implement diagnostic ultrasound procedures on patients. While many work as generalists there are specialties within the profession, for instance in pediatrics and cardiology. The majority work in Carolina RI clinics, hospitals, private practices or outpatient diagnostic imaging centers. Typical daily work functions of a sonogram technician may consist of:\n- Preserving records of patient medical histories and details of each procedure\n- Counseling patients by explaining the procedures and answering questions\n- Readying the ultrasound machines for use and then sterilizing and re-calibrating them\n- Escorting patients to treatment rooms and making them comfortable\n- Operating equipment while limiting patient exposure to sound waves\n- Evaluating results and identifying necessity for additional testing\nSonographers must frequently evaluate the performance and safety of their machines. They also must adhere to a high professional standard and code of conduct as health practitioners. In order to sustain that level of professionalism and stay up to date with medical knowledge, they are required to enroll in continuing education programs on an ongoing basis.", "score": 0.856439, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:ff68ebb0-8017-4de9-804d-4e072e7cd08d>", "text": "Ultrasound Technician Degrees Available\nSonogram tech students have the opportunity to acquire either an Associate or a Bachelor’s Degree. An Associate Degree will normally require about 18 months to 2 years to finish based upon the program and class load. A Bachelor’s Degree will require more time at up to 4 years to finalize. Another alternative for individuals who have already obtained a college degree is a post graduate certificate program. If you have earned a Bachelor’s Degree in any major or an Associate Degree in a relevant health field, you can instead choose a certificate program that will require only 12 to 18 months to complete. One thing to keep in mind is that the majority of sonographer colleges do have a clinical training component as a portion of their curriculum. It often may be fulfilled by entering into an internship program which many schools organize through Natural Bridge AL clinics and hospitals. Once you have graduated from any of the degree or certificate programs, you will then have to fulfill the certification or licensing requirements in Alabama or whatever state you elect to practice in.\nOnline Ultrasound Tech Schools\nAs earlier discussed, almost all ultrasound tech schools have a practical requirement to their programs. So although you can obtain a certificate or degree online, a significant part of the training will be either conducted in an on-campus lab or at a sponsored off campus facility. Practical training can typically be satisfied through an internship at a local Natural Bridge AL outpatient clinic, hospital or family practice. But the balance of the classes and training can be attended online in your Natural Bridge home. This is particularly convenient for those students that continue working while earning their degrees. Plus online programs are many times less expensive than traditional options. Costs for commuting and study materials may be decreased as well. But similarly as with every sonography college you are considering, make sure that the online program you choose is accredited. One of the most highly respected accrediting agencies is the Commission on Accreditation of Allied Health Education Programs (CAAHEP). Accreditation is especially crucial for certification, licensing and job placement (more on accreditation later).

Regardless of name, they all have the same primary job description, which is to implement diagnostic ultrasound testing on patients. Although many work as generalists there are specializations within the profession, for example in cardiology and pediatrics. The majority practice in Phenix City AL hospitals, clinics, private practices or outpatient diagnostic imaging centers. Standard daily job functions of an ultrasound tech can involve:\n- Preserving records of patient case histories and specifics of each procedure\n- Counseling patients by explaining the procedures and answering questions\n- Readying the ultrasound machines for usage and then cleaning and recalibrating them\n- Escorting patients to treatment rooms and making them comfortable\n- Using equipment while limiting patient exposure to sound waves\n- Assessing results and determining need for additional testing\nUltrasound techs must frequently assess the performance and safety of their machines. They also must adhere to a high ethical standard and code of conduct as medical practitioners. In order to maintain that level of professionalism and stay up to date with medical knowledge, they are mandated to complete continuing education training on an ongoing basis.", "score": 0.00027961713903284444, "source": "sparse"}]}

By default, this book provides great affirmative insights into the populous commonality of pronounced dolichocephaly.\nUsing both photographs and x-ray imaging, Las Trepanaciones shows how routinely trepanning was performed on the Dolicho-races, and others. The chronological distribution of trepanning specimens discussed here spanned from about 1000 B.C. through 1532 AD. Quite an ancient epoch, for such a modern idea. Given postmodern preoccupations with the Human Genome Project - the above begs the question re. recessive dolichocephalic genes in Peruvians today. Genetic research in America shows humans have been there at least 20,000 years. But from where and how old are the dolicho-race?\nThe Maltese skulls were mostly found interred in temple-tombs of goddess worship.

The earliest recorded surgical operations were circumcision and trepanation. (Circumcision is the removal of the foreskin of the penis. Trepanation involves making a hole in the skull to relieve pressure and/or release spirits.) The earliest instruments used in these procedures were flint or obsidian (shiny stone) knives and saws. Stone Age skulls from around the world have been found with holes in them from trepanning. Primitive people also used knives to cut off fingers damaged in accidents.\nAncient Mesopotamian (an area in southern Asia between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers) cultures practiced surgery to some degree. Small copper Sumerian (present-day southern Iraq) knives of about 3000 B.C. are believed to be surgical instruments. The Babylonian Code of Hammurabi of about 1700 B.C. mentions bronze lancets (sharp-pointed two-edged instruments used to make small incisions). Because the Code provided harsh penalties for poor medical treatment outcomes, surgery was prac-ticed only sparingly. Ancient Chinese and Japanese cultures were opposed to cutting into bodies, so surgical instruments were not used much.\nBy contrast, the ancient Egyptians recorded surgical procedures as early as 2500 B.C. Egyptians fashioned sharper instruments with a new metal, copper. They designed special tools to remove the brain from the skull when preparing bodies for mummification.\nHindus Excel at Surgery\nThe ancient Hindus of India excelled at surgery. The great surgical textbook, Sushruta Samhita, probably dates back to the last centuries B.C. This work described 20 sharp and 101 blunt surgical instruments. These instruments included forceps, pincers, trocars (sharp-pointed instruments fitted with a small tube), and cauteries (irons to heat and sear tissue). Most of these surgical tools were made of steel. The ancient Hindus also used lancets to carry out cataract surgery, scalpels to restore amputated noses via plastic surgery, and sharp knives to remove bladder stones. At about the same time, ancient Peruvians were performing trepanation.

In the earliest Sumerian Al Ubiad pottery, there is a clear association to the gods, and variations on the idea that it was a symbol of status, high rank, or wisdom have been recorded in the traditions of differing cultures around the world offering a common theme that exists in the minds of people to this day. The pertinent question with regard this phenomena is whether or not such cranial deformity dolichocephaly has ever existed naturally in humans, and if so, what is the significance of such persistent emulation through artificial deformity by so many peoples for such a long time.\nExamples of Dolicocephalic Czech Cranium 35,000 BC:\n\"14.", "score": 0.84378159, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:a50f9838-afca-45ad-9623-661ffce96b89>", "text": "The Incas Mastered the Grisly Practice of Drilling Holes in People’s Skulls\nIf you had a hole drilled through your skull in historical times, the odds of surviving the ordeal were far better in the ancient Inca Empire of South America than they were in North America during the American Civil War, a new study finds.\nResearchers made the finding by studying more than 800 Inca skulls found in Peru that had undergone trepanation — a practice in which a surgeon cuts, scrapes or drills a hole in a person’s head. Between 17 and 25 percent of these Inca patients died before their skulls healed, the researchers found.\nIn comparison, during the American Civil War (1861 to 1865), more than twice that percentage — between 46 and 56 percent of soldiers — died so soon after trepanation that their skulls had no time to heal, the researchers discovered.

Given that the Inca Empire existed a good 300 years before the American Civil War, it’s impressive that Inca trepanation patients had twice the survival rate of Civil War patients, Kushner said.\nThat difference likely comes down to hygiene, as sanitation was notoriously horrible on Civil War battlefields, the researchers said. For instance, Civil War surgeons regularly used unsterilized medical tools, and even their bare fingers, to dig inside head wounds or break up blood clots, said study co-researcher John Verano, a world authority on Peruvian trepanation at Tulane University in New Orleans.\nNearly every Civil War soldier wounded by gunfire later suffered from an infection, but the Inca appear to have experienced a much lower infection rate, the researchers said.\n“We do not know how the ancient Peruvians prevented infection, but it seems that they did a good job of it,” Kushner said.", "score": 0.843644, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:a32b2581-c439-4b8d-b0de-eda27ba32e03>", "text": "I will pass over the smaller differences among the nations, but will now treat of such as are great either from nature, or custom; and, first, concerning the Macrocephali [tribe or `nation' said to be living beyond the Bosphorus / Black Sea or maybe even further i.e Scythians - RD] There is no other race of men which have heads in the least resembling theirs\".\n\"...At first, usage was the principal cause of the length of their head, but now nature cooperates with usage.

One of the most intriguing of these practices that we learned about is cranial trepanation, in which the skull of the human being is intentionally deformed. This process is performed during early infancy when the skull is the most pliable.\nWhile visiting the Museo Nacional Arqueología, Antropología y Historia de Perú in Lima, we learned about this practice of the pre-Incan Paracas nation (750 BC-100 AD). The museum displays skulls that have undergone three different types of cranial trepanation. These variations employ a variety of methods and result in a different head shape. One type, called tabulate modeling, utilizes a wood panel placed at the nape of the neck and projected upwards; a rope keeps the wood panel steady. It results in an elongated skull that extends upwards. The second type of modeling we saw is trepanning, which also produces an elongated skull. The third type is bilobular results in a heart-shaped, rounded skull that is produced by a very specific method of wrapping cloth.\nResearchers strongly believe that this process was used in the Paracas culture as a means to delineate the social status of an individual. However, very little else is known, such as what does each separate shape say about the individual’s specific status? Our tour guide Fernando Benaducci Otayza (who was INCREDIBLY knowledgeable and passionate about Peruvian history!) had the opinion that head binding must have been performed on people of lower classes because it is an incredibly painful process (so, punishing?) with various neurological repercussions. I am encouraged to think the opposite, though simply because the process of head-binding requires a lot of planning and attention for an extended period of time; it makes more sense to me that this time could only be afforded to those of a higher social standing. After all, “beauty is pain” is a cultural saying that has reached just about every corner of the world.\nHowever, the intrigue isn’t so much in whether or not I am “right” or the tour guide is “right”, it’s in the mere fact that there is an elaborate cultural process that dramatically changed the lives of the Paracas people and continues to baffle us to this day. -Sarah", "score": 0.840549648, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:4a9d60b8-75fe-44a5-b5de-0d4def813953>", "text": "New study reveal origins of elongated skulls in the Carpathian Basin\nNew research published this month in the journal Neurosurgical Focus, has sought to unravel the history, origin, and ethnic context of elongated skulls found in the Carpathian Basin, a large basin in East-Central Europe centred in the territory of Hungary.\nThe phenomenon of elongated skulls has been observed in all continents and in different cultures around the world. While there are some skulls displaying features consistent with elongation being genetic, such as those in Paracas, Peru, it is also well-known that various groups of people around the world intentionally modified skull shape through a practice known as cranial deformation, which was performed with the help of strong pressure exerted on the head, typically from the first day of life to approximately 3 years of age.\nThe practice of intentional deformation of the skull was once widespread all over the world. According to current beliefs, this custom probably appeared independently in different regions of the world, beginning as early as the Late Paleolithic Period, but possibly even earlier. In the Carpathian Basin, elongated skulls date to the late Iron Age, known in this region as the Hun-Germanic Period (5 th – 6 th century AD), and can be observed in all the people of the Carpathian Basin equally– the Sarmatians, Alans, Gothics, Depidics, and Hun populations.

The frequent appearance of artificial cranial deformation in Europe and the Carpathian Basin can be attributed to the movements of the Huns, who flowed into Europe in the 4 th and 5 th centuries, pushing people of different Germanic origin westward.

And where will I go then?” The big unanswered questions are still posed today just as they were years ago by the first men who uttered them. Hence the origin of myths.\nThe word myth seems to have been invented in the 19th century to describe stories about the origins of the world and about mankind, in particular those of ancient civilisations such as the Assyrian civilisation (from Mesopotamia), Hebrew, Greek and Roman civilisations etc. Mythology is the study of these stories, of which only fragments remain, and which have continued to change over the course of these multi-millennial civilisations. And what can we surmise from the first mythical stories that came about during Magdalenian times, of which only a few wall frescos remain? Well, not a lot.\nIn other words, in our science-orientated age, disciplinary fields examining humanity’s great past consider the word myth as a crafty word for fairy story. The ancients certainly told some stories, for sure. Whereas today, with astrophysics and the string theory, things are far more logical, things are far more serious.\nBut if we look at the ancient Greek civilisation, whose myths were written down by Homer – finally someone to be reckoned with – they focused on maths as we do, they built the Parthenon and predicted eclipses… “It was back in pre-Socratic times that people distinguished, as Pindare said, between muthos and logos, sacred fantasies and rational discourse.” (Lucien Jerphagnon, Au bonheur des sages) With the birth of philosophy, rational discourse examined these great narratives that focused on root causes but tried to keep the allegorical dimension of myths intact. Lucien Jerphagon reminds us of a certain literary critic called Theagenes of Rhegium (5th century BC) who did this to maintain the reality of Homeric myths. Ancient historian and philosopher Paul Veyne also entitled one of his pieces of work: Do Greeks believe their myths? Certainly, but not without understanding that Apollo would not be coming to shake their hands as they exited the temple or sharing a glass of ouzo with them in the bar opposite it.

Of these, 64 genomes, ranging from 500 to 4500 years old, were newly sequenced – more than doubling the number of ancient individuals with genome-wide data from South America.\nTheir analysis included representatives of civilisations in the Andes from whom no genome-wide data had been reported before, including the Moche, Nasca, Wari, Tiwanaku and Inca.\nAnd it represents “a major step toward redressing the global imbalance in ancient DNA data”, according to Harvard’s David Reich, a professor of genetics.\n“The great majority of published ancient DNA studies to date have focused on western Eurasia,” he says. “This study in South America allows us to begin to discern at high resolution the detailed history of human movements in this extraordinarily important part of the world.”\nThe analyses revealed that by 9000 years ago, groups living in the Andean highlands became genetically distinct from those that eventually came to live along the Pacific coast.

Again, these differences can be observed today.\nAfter that time, gene flow occurred among all regions in the Andes, although it dramatically slowed after 2000 years ago.\nThe team discovered genetic exchanges both within the Andes and between Andean and non-Andean populations.

By 1926, designers were starting to create “mini-golf courses” on the rooftops of buildings in New York, and it soon became a very popular sport. After the start of the Great Depression however, frivolity became something people could not afford so cheaper courses started to spring up. Because these courses could not afford fancy obstacles, so they used whatever they had i.e. old tires, rain gutters, etc. until it eventually became so popular it was the norm.\nIn 1953, Mr. Don Clayton was fed up with the silly style that had become the norm, and he became an advocate for mini-golf as a serious sport. This is the form we modeled our Adventure Golf after, with undulating terrain, beautiful landscaping, and a natural pond complete with waterfall.

Jones wanted this concept of golf course architecture to make a contribution to the game as well as give expression to his ideas about golf course design. This club would be open during the winter season only.\nThomas Barrett, Jr., a mutual friend of Jones and Roberts, was consulted and recommended a 365-acre property called Fruitland Nurseries. The nursery was once an indigo plantation and was purchased in 1857 by Belgian Baron Louis Mathieu Edouard Berckmans, who was a horticulturist by hobby. Berckmans’ son,\nProsper Julius Alphonso, was an agronomist and horticulturist by profession, and the two formed a partnership in 1858. Operating under the name Fruitland Nurseries, the company imported many trees and plants from various countries. The Baron died in 1883. Prosper’s death followed in 1910 and the nursery ceased operations by the time its charter expired in 1918. A great variety of flowering plants and trees, including a long row of magnolias, which were planted before the Civil War, and a plant Prosper popularized called the azalea, remained on the property.\nUpon seeing the property from what is now the practice putting green, Jones said, “Perfect! And to think this ground has been lying here all these years waiting for someone to come along and lay a golf course on it.”\nConstruction on the new course began in the first half of 1931 and the course opened in December 1932 with a limited amount of member play.

Alton Jones. Roberts proposed the event be called the Masters Tournament, but Bobby Jones objected thinking it too presumptuous.

He became professional at the municipal course in Galveston, where he secured backing for the winter tournament circuit, or \"tour,\" from nightclub owner Sam Maceo. Victories in 1938 and 1939 earned him an invitation to the Masters Tournament, which he won in 1940 and twice subsequently; he was that tournament's first three-time winner.\nAfter wartime service in the navy, Demaret was among the top ten in golf earnings from 1946 through 1950; in 1947 he was leading money winner, Vardon Trophy recipient, and holder of seven titles. He also played on victorious Ryder Cup (1947, 1949, 1951) and World Cup (1961) teams and was enrolled in the PGA Hall of Fame, the World Golf Hall of Fame, the Texas Sports Hall of Fame, and the Texas Golf Hall of Fame. In 1958 Demaret and Jack Burke, Jr., opened the Champions Golf Club in Houston. In the early 1970s he was a partner in the Onion Creek Club near Austin, where in 1978 he was instrumental in promoting the Legends of Golf Tournament, which inspired the Senior PGA Tour.\nWell known in entertainment circles, he pioneered colorful dress on the professional tour and in the late 1960s hosted the popular television series \"Shell's Wonderful World of Golf.\"", "score": 0.800198793, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:bf5c2495-18ed-4837-a56e-cd5c5fe117ba>", "text": "Joe Lloyd (1 US Open)\n1964 - 19\nHe was the first golf professional in France, being hired in 1883 at the Pau Golf Club in Pau, France, by Englishmen spending their winters there. One of those Englishmen was John Cumming Macdona, a member at Hoylake and Pau, but who had formed a friendship with Fleetwood Sandeman of the famous Port and Sherry company. Fleetwood Sandeman was the first Captain in 1883 at Hayling Golf Club in Hampshire, where the Sandeman family had a summer house, and Macdona arranged for Joseph Lloyd to become the first professional at Hayling where Lloyd helped lay out the first 9-hole course on the seafront. 'The General', as Lloyd was popularly known, left Hayling after two seasons. From 1895 to 1909 Lloyd spent his summers as the club professional at the Essex County Club, in Manchester, Massachusetts, and was succeeded by Donald Ross as the club professional there. Lloyd retired from the Pau Golf Club in 1925.\nLloyd was known as a player capable of extremely long drives and was considered to be one of the longest hitters in his day. In the 1897 tournament, he was trailing entering the final round. He hit a long drive at the 465-yard 18th hole, following by a wonderful brassie shot to within 8 feet of the pin. He proceeded to sink the putt for an eagle 3 on the par-5 hole that gave him a one-stroke victory over Willie Anderson (who would later win four U.S. Opens).

After all, its history dates back centuries, and many of the stories of years past are legendary. Perhaps the greatest tournament of them all, however, is the Masters. Held at Georgia's beautiful Augusta National Golf Club, this annual event is the first of golf's four majors and has provided anybody lucky enough to get Masters tickets with an experience unlike any other. |\nOften referred to as U.S. Masters by persons outside of the United States, the tournament is the sole annual golf championship that is held at the same location year over year. Located in Augusta, Georgia, the Augusta National Golf Course was founded by Bobby Jones and Clifford Roberts. An amateur golf champion and a banker, respectively, the unlikely pair joined forces to create a course that the world’s best players would desire. Frequented by golf’s upper echelon, Masters Tournament has not only been the source of many innovative policies of play, but also is the foundation for many interesting traditions. These traditions, dating back to the late 1940s, include the presentation of a green jacket to the winner which is returned after one year, the playing of a social Par 3 contest the day before the tournament and a super exclusive dinner attended only by past champions and board members. The dinner has been graced by greats Sam Snead, Fred McLeod, Jock Hutchinson, Gene Sarazen, Byron Nelson, Arnold Palmer and Jack Nicklaus.\nThe Masters Tournament is a professional Golf competition that golf enthusiasts look forward to the first complete week of April every year. At the tournament’s 1934 inception it was billed as the Augusta National Invitation Tournament, continuing to be known as such over the next five years. Continually fine tuned to provide patrons and competitors with the finest golf experience possible, the Masters is the event that golf aficionados and appreciators must attend. At the first Masters, Horton Smith won the first of his two titles, and ever since some of the biggest names in golf have come to Augusta year after year.\nAside from quirky traditions, Masters is home to such pioneering policies as: playing 18 holes on each of four days, abolishing qualifying rounds, allowing only players and caddies to be inside the playing area as well as limiting commercialization of the event.

That was the worst I got up to.\"\nAs for playing conditions on a mini tour event, it was a far cry from the pristine greens and well-manicured fairways at TPC Southwind, a private course in an upscale gated community.\n\"You play mini tour courses and they are cow pastures,\" said Affrunti, who played collegiately at The University of Illinois. \"College golf has you on the best courses. For a few years, I thought I was better than mini tour courses. But you are only as good as the tour you are playing on. I had to work my way up the ranks.

He'd used the mini tours as a tool. They taught him how to score low. A simple minus-5 under par wouldn't be enough to survive another week or make another credit card payment.\nThen his shoulder and wrist injuries happened.\nKnowledge would have to be stored. Affrunti's biggest concern wasn't that he wouldn't be able to utilize how to attack a tricky pin on a tour-firm green or how to book the best hotel closest to the course at the lowest price.\nInstead it would be rehab, recovery and relearning of a golf swing that Affrunti, a former hockey player, describes as a \"slap shot on the golf course.\"\nFueled by doubters that said he couldn't recapture his form after surgeries to his wrist and shoulder, vital body parts for a player that strives on feeling his golf swing rather than mechanically getting into positions, Affrunti said he is finally healthy.\n\"I saw a ton of specialists before I got shoulder and wrist surgery,\" Affrunti said. \"It's not something you take the first opinion on.

I actually came back stronger. I reworked my swing. People that make it convince themselves it's going to work. I don't have a backup plan, so this better work. Tell yourself that enough times and it's going to work.\"\nPGA Tour courses are immaculate compared to the mini tours on which Affrunti carved out his game. There is a spacious, air conditioned clubhouse. A traveling gym and physical therapy center for players. There will also be a large crowd and television audience.\nBut to Affrunti, it's just another job.\n\"People don't see the non-stop grind,\" Affrunti said. \"They only see Thursday to Sunday. Not the flight out Sunday night. The getting clubs tweaked on Monday. In Memphis, it's humid, so your skin puffs up. I get blisters everywhere. My fingers are all taped up.\n\"My toe is taped up.

People wouldn't want to go into the office on their off day.\"\nTo stay in the top 125 on the money list and keep his PGA Tour card, Affrunti will need to earn $650,000. It seems like a huge sum of money. But factor in flights, car rental, hotel rooms, meals, caddy fees and other incidental costs and the sum becomes considerably less.\nWhen Affrunti finished in the top 25 of the Nationwide Tour and secured his PGA card he begrudgingly wrote an income tax check that would have netted him a new Mercedes.\n\"If you make half a million in any other job, you are killing it,\" Affrunti said. \"If you do that out here, you are losing your job.

Zarley Jr. was discharged from the U.S. Army in the spring of 1964. (I still remember my dog tag #: ER18667197.) I had played only two rounds of golf during the past six months of active duty. That didn’t exactly prepare me for the new kind of battle I was about to undertake. I quickly exchanged my black, shiny, lace-up army boots for some colored, golf shoes with metal spikes on the soles. And my green, Army fatigues would now become history. At that time, I had more feel for my M-14 rifle than for my Bulls Eye putter. I was much more prepared to shoot bullets than to launch golf balls.\nBut I wanted to launch my PGA Tour career when the Tour came to my collegiate hometown of Houston, Texas. So, I began my pro golf career three weeks later at the 1964 Houston Open, played at Sharpstown Country Club. During my first two tournament rounds, on Thursday and Friday, I was paired with a Touring pro I had never heard of, a guy named Bert Yancey (1938-1994). He was beginning his career on the PGA Tour about the same time I was.\nYancey went on to considerable success on the Tour, playing full-time for the next thirteen years and winning seven PGA Tour tournaments. He never won a major, but he had several chances. Twice he finished third in the Masters, and fourth another time. And twice he finished third in the U.S. Open. Having lived in Augusta, Bert especially wanted to win the Masters. He even mapped out the course by making a colored, clay model of the Augusta National Golf Club layout. He thought it would help him learn better the many undulations of those fast greens.\nThat first time I played golf with Bert Yancey left a very vivid impression on my mind about him. Standing about six feet, one inch tall, blond-haired Yancey strolled down the fairway with a slow gait, clothes nicely pressed, pants riding high on his hips, shoulders back and head held high. His posture reminded me of my drill sergeant back at Fort Sam Houston Medical Training School. Being from Florida and Georgia, Bert spoke slowly and with a slight southern drawl.

The mistake led to a triple bogey and dropped him seven back at the time.\n“Through 13 holes I couldn’t have drawn up a better round of golf,” said Warren. “Brett was just playing great.”\nAfter putting a 7 on his scorecard, Warren rallied and canned two of four birdie putts he looked at down the stretch.\n“I was proud of myself,” he said. “At that point it would have been easy to pack it up without a chance to win.”\n--Brett Wetterich holds the tournament 54-hole record at 22 under par back in 2003.\n--The largest 54-hole lead in tournament history is six strokes by Robert Garrigus in 2004.

The Huntington’s founder, business magnate Henry E. Huntington, possessed a penchant for plants as well as books and art. His resplendent 120-acre estate features an array of specimens from around the globe that thrive in the mild Southern California climate.\nDespite being a delight for the plant lover, the institution’s plant collections are sometimes overshadowed by the more well-known research library and museum. Kitty Connolly, The Huntington’s Associate Director of Education, expressed the need to advocate for the horticultural collections within the larger institution. One accomplishment in this arena was the construction of The Rose Hills Foundation Conservatory for Botanical Science, which houses “Plants Are Up to Something,” a family-friendly exhibit designed to encourage discovery of plant processes through scientific inquiry. “Real plants, real tools, real science” was the conceptual motto for exhibition development, which combines interactive science stations with the beauty of a lush conservatory. Winning the 2007 American Association of Museums Excellence in Exhibition Competition certainly helped throw the spotlight on The Huntington’s plant wealth.\nAfter taking a brief tour of the herbarium and tissue culture lab with Plant Conservation Specialist Sean Lahmeyer, we were encouraged to explore the grounds on our own. Outside the conservatory, a panorama of green awaited, with an expanse of rolling lawns that perfectly matched the scale of the gargantuan library and museum.\nDiscrete garden areas transport visitors to plant communities that are worlds apart.

Inside the Jungle Garden, the cooling sound of waterfalls guide you through rich green undergrowth, shaded by a canopy dripping with vines.

After parking and making our way onto the grounds, we were immediately impressed by our surroundings. Although I was hungry, as we made our way past signs pointing to the property’s various gardens and The Huntington Art Gallery, I was somewhat anxious to get through our scheduled tea time so that we could explore all of the beauty around us.\nWhile our tea experience was good, I have to admit that I was a bit disappointed by the fact that tea in the Rose Garden Tea Room is served buffet style; I had high hopes for a more traditional afternoon tea. However, the buffet allowed us to eat our fill of finger sandwiches, salads, assorted cheeses, fruits, and sweets accompanied by endless pots of tea (despite the fact that we could only handle one) which, I suppose, justified the pricey $31 per person price tag which doesn’t include admission to The Huntington itself.\nAfter tea, we made our way through the Rose Garden to the Japanese Garden. I was completely enthralled by the pristine architectural landscape of the space. The Japanese Garden is complete with a high-arching drum bridge, a traditional Japanese house known as a ryokan, a bonsai court, a walled Zen garden, and more. Although I have yet to visit Japan, wandering through the Japanese Garden instantly transported me there.\nNot thinking that I could be more mesmerized, I was pleasantly surprised when we wandered into Liu Fang Yuan, the Garden of Flowing Fragrance.

treasure houses of biodiversity, but all rainforests are not the same. Biodiversity may be more evenly distributed in some forests than in others and, therefore, may require different management and preservation strategies. That is one of the conclusions of a large-scale Smithsonian study of a lowland rainforest in New Guinea, published in the Aug. 9 issue of the journal Nature.\nMost previous research has focused on diversity \"hot spots,\" such as upland rainforests in the foothills of the Andes, where steep gradients in elevation, temperature, rainfall and other environmental factors boost diversity by creating diverse habitats within a short distance. Such change in a region's species makeup between sites is called beta diversity: some rainforests have steep environmental gradients and high beta diversity.\nA large proportion of the world's remaining rainforests are lowland forests in New Guinea, Borneo and the Congo and Amazon Basins. Many researchers have speculated that such lowland rainforests also would have high beta diversity, but this has not been rigorously tested. Little data exists for species distributions in these vast forests, particularly for insects, which make up a large share of the world's biodiversity.\nAn international group of entomologists and botanists, including Smithsonian researchers, has assembled data representing 500 species of caterpillars, ambrosia beetles and fruit flies in the undisturbed lowland rainforest of the Sepik and Ramu river basins in Papua New Guinea. The team collected insects and plants from eight study sites across 75,000 square kilometers of contiguous forest--an area the size of South Carolina--and noted the variation in species makeup among the different sites.\nThe data showed low beta diversity across the study area for all three groups of insects as well as for plants, indicating that species tend to be widespread and the biological communities change very little even across large distances. The widespread distribution of insect species was a surprise, given the sedentary lifestyles of many species.\n\"Some spend their entire lives on a single plant, but they've got wings. They may not want to fly, but they can if they need to,\" said Smithsonian scientist Scott Miller, an author of the Nature paper. The insects also showed limited specialization in the plant species they feed upon, in contrast to the common assumption that tropical species tend to be highly specialized.", "score": 0.826970696, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:6ab319dd-3465-4bdd-b735-8c45ab8f2628>", "text": "How do traditional populations deal with habitats fragmented by forest fires, with loss of biodiversity, with increasing risks of flooding? The report is rounded off with a synthesis offering promising approaches for policy-making and project work.\nCoffee from Vietnam: what a cup of it also contains\nSince the 1990s, Vietnam’s transition from a planned to a market economy has led to rapid economic growth and better integration into the global market. Coffee production has been drastically expanded and has caused a considerable wave of migration from the lowlands to the central highlands.\nBased on two case studies, one of an in-migration region and one of an out-migration region, this article shows that the flow of migration has economic, ecological and social impacts on all populations involved. Coffee prices on the global market are volatile. At the same time, coffee production requires increased inputs in fertilisers and irrigation, leading to accelerated soil degradation. This, in turn, exposes all parties involved to increased risks to the sustainability of their livelihoods.\nSupport for out-migrants from family members and social networks is an important strategy to counteract these risks. However, it transfers the risks to those left behind. At the same time, the migration dynamics between the two regions also affects the development of neighbouring regions (urbanisation, industry).\nBased on these insights, the author underlines the importance of taking into consideration the linkages between all regions and populations involved, as well as their coping strategies, when researching the impacts of globalisation on these mountain regions.\nSource: Rural In-migration and Global\nTrade.

How is biodiversity affected by this logging? The answers differ and are controversial among ecologists, environmentalists, and policymakers, and these disagreements have implications for the conservation of biodiversity.\nA new paper by postdoctoral researcher Benjamin Ramage and co-authors, published in Conservation Biology, exposes a critical factor underlying these disagreements, shedding light on past controversies and providing a path forward. The researchers combined a literature review and an analysis of field data to show that (a) most studies of logging in tropical forests suffer from a serious methodological flaw (the failure to distinguish effects of logging from pre-existing differences between logged and unlogged areas), and (b) there is a high probability that pre-existing spatial variation will be falsely interpreted as a treatment effect in such studies.\nThe results of the study demonstrate that logging effects have been systematically exaggerated while important differences relating to specific management strategies have been obscured. These findings have major implications for the science behind tropical biodiversity conservation, as current policies and initiatives are relying upon a body of peer-reviewed literature that is rife with unwarranted conclusions. Confronting these issues is essential for accurately assessing biodiversity in logged forests, identifying the relative merits of specific management practices and landscape configurations, and effectively balancing conservation with timber production in tropical forests.\nThe researchers suggest solutions to these problems to provide an immediate positive feedback on the interpretation of past studies and the implementation of future initiatives. In addition, by demonstrating that methodological issues can permeate and undermine an entire sub-discipline, jeopardizing the success of numerous related initiatives, this paper presents a cautionary tale that may catalyze similar critiques in other areas of ecology.", "score": 0.824650824, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:bddbd7f3-a366-46e9-a14b-dc4a3bb545b5>", "text": "Conserving Key Biodiversity Sites in the Amazon Rainforest\nAmazonia is the ultimate biodiversity-rich tropical wilderness, encompassing more than 6 million km² in nine South American countries. Within its borders lie the largest river system on Earth, and more than half the world’s remaining tropical rainforest. Recent surveys indicate more than 1300 bird species, 263 of them endemic. The Amazon is also home to a wealth of indigenous human cultures.\nIn the Brazilian Amazon alone, deforestation has averaged 1.8 million hectares per year since 1998, the highest rate for any tropical forest area. Major drivers include agricultural expansion policies and transboundary road developments. Forecasts indicate that up to 40% of the forest may be lost by the middle of the century, and BirdLife has raised the threat status of 100 bird species likely to be affected.\nThese threats arise from insufficient consideration of biodiversity conservation in the plans and policies of other sectors. The Aage V Jensen Charity Foundation approved a grant to support BirdLife International and national Partner SAVE Brasil in the development of a simple but effective blueprint for conservation of Amazonian biodiversity.\nThe project set out to identify the highest priority Amazonian sites, using BirdLife’s Important Bird and Biodiversity Area criteria, and integrate them into other national and regional policy sectors, particularly agriculture, forestry, mining, transport and urban development.\nAt the start of the project, full national IBA inventories had been prepared only for the five countries of the Tropical Andes. Over the next few years, a total of 130 IBAs were identified in the Amazon basin: 14 in Bolivia, 42 in Brazil, ten in Colombia, seven in Ecuador, nine in French Guiana, eight in Guyana, 13 in Peru, nine in Suriname and 18 in Venezuela.\nThe results of this work were incorporated in the Brazil’s second IBA directory, and in the regional directory, Important Bird Areas Americas - Priority sites for biodiversity conservation. (The IBA data is fully accessible via BirdLife’s World Bird Database).\nAll IBAs are priorities for conservation. But with limited time and resources, action to minimise biodiversity loss is more urgent for some than others. Priorities were set by combining measures of threat with a measure of biological importance based on IBA criteria. Each national Partner organisation held a series of workshops with local people and researchers from NGOs and government, to obtain first hand information about threats to IBAs.", "score": 0.820419252, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:23a43e08-74eb-485d-a1d2-c2fc3d00ce38>", "text": "Not without challenge, there is typically a correlation between island endemics and diversity; that is, that the greater the diversity (species richness) of an island, the greater the increase in endemism. Increased diversity effectively drives speciation. Furthermore, the number of endemics on an island is directly correlated with the relative isolation of the island and its area. In some cases, speciation on islands has occurred rapidly.\nDispersal and in situ speciation are the agents that explain the origins of the organisms in Hawaii. Various geographic modes of speciation have been studied extensively in Hawaiian biota, and in particular, angiosperms appear to have speciated predominately in allopatric and parapatric modes.\nIslands are not the only geographic locations that have endemic species. South America has been studied extensively with its areas of endemism representing assemblages of allopatrically distributed species groups. Charis butterflies are a primary example, confined to specific regions corresponding to phylogenies of other species of butterflies, amphibians, birds, marsupials, primates, reptiles, and rodents. The pattern indicates repeated vicariant speciation events among these groups. It is thought that rivers may play a role as the geographic barriers to Charis,:97 not unlike the river barrier hypothesis used to explain the high rates of diversity in the Amazon basin—though this hypothesis has been disputed. Dispersal-mediated allopatric speciation is also thought to be a significant driver of diversification throughout the Neotropics.\nPatterns of increased endemism at higher elevations on both islands and continents have been documented on a global level. As topographical elevation increases, species become isolated from one another; often constricted to graded zones. This isolation on \"mountain top islands\" creates barriers to gene flow, encouraging allopatric speciation, and generating the formation of endemic species. Mountain building (orogeny) is directly correlated with—and directly affects biodiversity. The formation of the Himalayan mountains and the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau for example have driven the speciation and diversification of numerous plants and animals such as Lepisorus ferns; glyptosternoid fishes (Sisoridae); and the Rana chensinensis species complex.", "score": 0.819345415, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:c5681a14-dffd-45b2-ac83-bb06b20fe04d>", "text": "Some key features of the MWP include: (i) concentration of biodiversity hotspots in mountain areas, ecosystem diversity, species richness and number of endemic and threatened species; (ii) the fragility of mountain ecosystems and species and their vulnerability to man-made and natural disturbances, particularly in relation to land-use and climatic changes; (iii) the interconnectedness between highlands and lowlands, especially as regards water and soil, and (iv) the high level of cultural diversity, including the key role of indigenous and local communities in conservation and management of biological diversity (UNEP/CDB/AHTEG-MB 2003).\nThis paper is an overview of mountain research in Brazil – which is often hidden or fragmented – that lists mountain sites and locations that are threatened and/or understudied. Further, I propose the creation of a national programme on mountain biodiversity, so as to protect and produce knowledge about the great biological richness of these habitats.\nMountain ecosystems are typically diverse and rich in species, particularly in the tropics (Chaverri-Polini 1998, Sarmiento 2002). This may be attributed to three main factors that have acted at different time scales: biotic evolution in response to climatic and geological history; species adaptations to environmental constraints; and biotic exchanges with the surrounding lowlands (Sarmiento 2002).

Biodiversity is defined by the number of varieties of species, including plants, insects and wildlife, living in an ecosystem. High levels of biodiversity are important for the health of ecosystems and wildlife. RSPO Certified growers are required to take measures to conserve and/or enhance biodiversity beyond the boundaries of their land rights, including identifying, protecting and/or enhancing the connectivity of forest areas that are identified as important for biodiversity.\nUse of fire for land clearing is a common practice for many farmers around the world, but RSPO certified oil palm growers are prohibited from using fire to clear their land. While it may serve as a cheap and convenient way to clear weeds and unwanted growth to make way for the desired crops, this practice releases harmful smoke into the area, releases carbon emissions and often spreads beyond what is intended. This has led to widespread fires and a thick haze in many parts of the world where this is practiced.

The main difference between the two is that they have different diversity ranges when it comes to animal and plant species. In a square acre of land in tropical you can find an already diverse bionetwork and find complete biological diversification in another square acre unlike temperate which are attributed by specific species only. For instance, temperate rainforests could have 6 to 8 species of trees but tropical rainforests could have at least 300 different tree species.\nSustaining rainforests is central to interdependence or the concept that everything in nature is connected to each other and cannot survive without the help of plants, animals and essential abiotic factors including sun, soil, water and air. As such, there are enormous benefits that we can derive from these rainforests in three forms: environment, communal resources and personal enjoyment (Cramer, 2000, pp. 73-75).\nFirst, rainforests are effective source of oxygen and carbon and it can drive and water cycles as well. Rainforests also help stop flooding, prevent erosion, soil fertility and replenish groundwater as well as provide shade and shelter. In terms of biological interactions, rainforests became habitats and/or refuge for and support interdependence of various flora and fauna wherein animals and insects pollinate plants, animals eat insect pests and plants feed animals.\nSecond, rainforests are responsible for genetic resources, education, recreation, scientific discoveries and the two most important of all pharmaceutical products and food. These rainforests also function as suppliers of clean and regular water and fresh air around the world despite their relative minimal size geographically. In addition, rainforests are beneficial sources of plants for horticultural industry and hydro energy.\nFinally, rainforests are a place for serenity and sense of place. Scenic views, bushwalking, bird watching, camping and lifestyle are just some of the personal enrichment that could be derived from rainforest experiences.

Understanding the relationship between wind and trajectory is crucial to making informed decisions on the golf course.\nOne way wind affects trajectory is through its influence on the spin of the ball. When a golf ball is hit with spin, the wind can either amplify or counteract that spin, altering the ball’s flight path. For example, a headwind can reduce the amount of backspin on a ball, causing it to roll farther upon landing. Additionally, a crosswind can create side spin on the ball, causing it to hook or slice.\nAnother way wind can impact trajectory is through its effect on the lift of the golf ball. When a ball is struck, it creates lift as air flows over and under it. Wind can either increase or decrease this lift, changing the trajectory of the ball. For example, a tailwind can increase the lift on a ball, causing it to travel farther. On the other hand, a headwind can reduce the lift, causing the ball to drop more quickly and travel a shorter distance.\nTo compensate for wind’s effect on trajectory, golfers can adjust their shot strategy. For example, they might choose a different club to compensate for a headwind or tailwind. Additionally, they might alter their swing to create more or less spin on the ball, depending on the wind’s direction and speed. By taking wind into account when planning their shots, golfers can maintain greater control and consistency on the course.\nWind’s Effect on Golf Ball Direction\nOne of the most notable factors affected by wind is a golf ball’s direction. Wind can alter the ball’s intended path and cause it to veer off course, making it difficult for golfers to maintain control over their shots.\nThe degree to which wind affects direction depends on several factors, including the speed and direction of the wind, as well as the height and trajectory of the ball. When hitting into the wind, the ball will generally travel shorter distances and drop more quickly, resulting in a lower trajectory. On the other hand, hitting with a tailwind can increase distance and cause the ball to fly higher and farther than expected.\nTo compensate for the effect of wind on direction, golfers can adjust their aim and club selection.", "score": 0.861061275, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:c7d12ba7-1137-4e28-b447-d8b1677a8ff6>", "text": "For example, when hitting into a headwind, golfers may choose to use a more robust club or aim to the left of their target to account for the ball’s tendency to veer to the right. Conversely, when hitting with a tailwind, they may select a weaker club and aim to their right to compensate for the ball’s tendency to move leftward.\nStrategies for Navigating Windy Conditions\nAs a professional golfer, I know that dealing with windy conditions can be challenging. However, there are several strategies that can help you navigate the wind and maintain better control over your shots.\nChoosing the right club is crucial when playing in windy conditions. In general, it is advisable to use longer clubs, as their flatter trajectory is less affected by the wind. Additionally, a lower lofted club can help keep the ball flight lower and decrease the impact of the wind.\nWhen hitting into the wind, it’s important to adjust your shot to compensate for the wind’s effect. This may include hitting a lower shot, reducing the club’s loft, or playing the ball further back in your stance. Conversely, when hitting with the wind, you may want to hit a higher shot to take advantage of the wind’s added lift.\nTechniques for Maximizing Performance\nThere are several techniques you can use to maximize your performance in windy conditions. One such technique is to swing easier and concentrate on making solid contact with the ball. This will help reduce spin and provide more control over the ball’s flight. Additionally, focusing on a more balanced stance and maintaining a smooth tempo can also help maintain consistency in windy conditions.\nBy implementing these strategies, you’ll be better equipped to handle windy conditions and maintain greater control over your shots. Remember, understanding the impact of wind on your shots is key to achieving your desired outcomes on the golf course.\nUnderstanding wind’s impact on a golf ball is crucial to enhancing performance on the course. In this article, we have discussed how wind can affect distance, direction, trajectory, and spin, and provided valuable tips for navigating windy conditions.\nFirstly, wind can either enhance or hinder the distance a golf ball can travel. The magnitude of wind’s effect on shots can be estimated, and golfers can compensate for this effect by selecting appropriate clubs and adjusting their shots.\nSecondly, wind can influence the trajectory of a golf ball by altering its spin and flight path.", "score": 0.852314413, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:54fc3c51-f0e9-467c-9916-0f53b8d71960>", "text": "Results have demonstrated that upwards of 80% of your initial ball flight direction is determined by the clubface direction and the other 15%–20% is influenced by the relationship between the clubface direction and swing path.\nFor example, have you noticed someone slice the ball and they're advised to aim more to the left? This fundamentally shifts the swing path and can result in the clubface direction to become much more open. As a result, you have a path that's traveling much more to the left and a clubface that is directed more to the right of the path (open).\nA common sight with beginners is seeing their ball flight start off to the left and have a large curve off to the right (the banana slice ). This leads to much more slice, more distance lost, and more accuracy lost. You'll be missing the boat by simply altering your swing path to correct this problem. This is because only about 15%–20% of the golf ball direction is affected by the swing path.\nIf you wish to hit it straight, the face of the club needs to point along the swing path. Using this knowledge, you can control your own swing and your golf game improvement. You can easily make on the spot corrections, just as the good players do.\nThe next time you play a round or visit the driving range, pay attention to your flight.

What can you learn from the leftovers of your golf shot? A good golf detective probably could tell exactly what your normal ball flight is without ever seeing your swing or you even hit a ball, simply by observing the footprints left from your stance and the divot you left when hitting the ball. The club path created by the golf swing can only take one of three directions: 1) outside-in, 2) square-to-target, and 3) inside-out. Every golfer probably has a natural tendency to swing on one of these paths based on his/her body type and range of flexibility. And you can play great golf using any of the three basic club paths (ruling out exaggerations of each which completely break down swing mechanics) if you can repeat the motion consistently and ensure the club head is square to the target at impact. A golfers club path is controlled by his/her shoulders. Simply put, the ball flight of a golf shot is going to follow the alignment of the golfers shoulders. If your shoulders are square to the target at impact, then the ball flight will start at the target. If your shoulders are pointed left of the target, then basic swing mechanics will cause your ball to start left of the target. Conversely, if your shoulders are right of the target at impact, ball flight will start to the right of the target. It sounds easy enough, but the story doesnt stop there. While the club path is controlled by the shoulders, the club face is controlled by the hands. To consistently hit shots at the target, a golfer must make contact with the club face square to the target. This requires quiet hands. A handsy swing makes it virtually impossible to have the club face arrive at the ball in a square position every time and to develop a consistent and dependable ball flight. This concept of developing a consistent, dependable ball flight is essential to playing good golf. It gives you a go-to shot you can rely upon in most playing situations. Tour pros all have their money shots that are based on a reliable ball flight. About 70 percent of pros use a slightly outside-in club path that produces a consistent controlled fade.", "score": 0.848253846, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:012a848a-3a71-4e44-84aa-8ba21324a7da>", "text": "Every single golf swing contains two separate golf swing paths, one for the backswing and one for the downswing.

Understanding the cause and effect of wind conditions is critical to making informed decisions and executing successful shots on the course.\nWind’s impact on golf ball flight can be broken down into three primary components: distance, trajectory, and direction.\nWind’s Influence on Distance\nWind has the most noticeable impact on a golf ball’s distance. Headwinds will slow down the ball causing it to fall short of its intended target. Conversely, tailwinds will add distance to the shot allowing it to travel further than normal. Crosswinds can move the ball off its intended line, affecting both distance and direction.\nIt’s important to note that the impact of wind on distance varies depending on the specific conditions and shot type. For instance, longer shots with more airtime are more susceptible to wind effects than shorter shots with less airtime.\nWind’s Role in Trajectory\nWind can also significantly alter a golf ball’s trajectory. When hit with backspin, a golf ball will rise higher and remain in the air longer. Headwinds can exaggerate this effect, sending the ball soaring higher and further than intended. In contrast, tailwinds can reduce the ball’s height and cause it to fly on a lower trajectory.\nSimilarly, side winds can cause a ball to curve or slice unexpectedly, affecting both its trajectory and its ultimate destination.", "score": 0.843744099, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:e18bf4a9-df74-4944-b6b7-994d2b96b718>", "text": "The face of the club starts square to the target line. The club goes straight back and straight through along the same path like a pendulum. One strategy is to aim the ball 10% past the hole. Another is to look at the hole for long putts instead of the ball. For short distance putts, sometimes the Safety Putt is employed.\nList of shots\n- A drive is a long-distance shot played from the tee box, intended to move the ball a great distance down the fairway towards the green.\n- An approach shot is made with the intention of placing the ball on the green. The term \"approach\" typically refers to a second or subsequent shot with a shorter-range iron depending on the distance required.\n- A lay-up shot is made from the fairway after the drive, but intended to travel a shorter distance than might normally be expected and/or with a higher degree of accuracy, due to intervening circumstances. Most often, a lay-up shot is made to avoid hitting the ball into a hazard placed in the fairway, or to position the ball in a more favorable position on the fairway for the next shot.\n- A chip is a very short shot played from near the green, generally made with an abbreviated swing motion. Chip shots are used as short approach shots to the green.\n- A pitch is slightly longer than a chip shot and thus requires a slightly larger swing. It is generally hit with a lofted club and expected to stop fairly quickly once reaching the green.\n- A bunker shot is a shot played from a sand trap. It is hit with a lofted wedge and is intended to hit the ball high so that it can carry over the lip of the bunker while still staying on the green.\n- A flop shot is when a player opens the club face on a chip shot to get the ball to fly over an obstacle and stop quickly or spin back once it hits the ground.\n- A putt is a shot designed to roll the ball along the ground. It is normally made on the putting green using a putter, though other clubs may be used to achieve the same effect in different situations. A lag is a long putt designed less to try to place the ball in the cup than to simply move the ball closer to the hole for an easier putt into the hole.\n- A draw is a stroke played with the effect that, for a right-handed player, the ball moves from right to left during flight.", "score": 0.84323, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:6652dada-d4cf-49b0-a0cf-9851636b3ce0>", "text": "- Aligning your body independently of your ball’s targetline will allow the club to move on differing tracks through the ball, allowing you to alter the curvature of the golf ball.\n- The proper amount of forward bending of the upperbody will allow the shoulders to drive the arms, hands, and clubshaft during the swing.\nFor the Professional Player:\n- The forward bending of the spine is between 25 to 32 degrees forward, allowing the arms to have clearance from the body.\n- The angle of the clubshaft and the forward wrist influences the actions of the clubshaft to the top; the more the forward arm and club shaft are in-line, the more the clubshaft will stay on one plane throughout the golf swing.", "score": 0.842385709, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:a802392e-afc9-492c-9fd3-02174024b435>", "text": "- Aligning your body independently of your ball’s targetline will allow the club to move on differing tracks through the ball, allowing you to alter the curvature of the golf ball.\n- The proper amount of forward bending of the upperbody will allow the shoulders to drive the arms, hands, and clubshaft during the swing.\nFor the Professional Player:\n- The forward bending of the spine is between 25 to 32 degrees forward, allowing the arms to have clearance from the body.\n- The angle of the clubshaft and the forward wrist influences the actions of the clubshaft to the top; the more the forward arm and club shaft are in-line, the more the clubshaft will stay on one plane throughout the golf swing.", "score": 0.842385709, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:c7d12ba7-1137-4e28-b447-d8b1677a8ff6>", "text": "Wind’s Effect on Direction\nWind can also impact the direction of a golf ball. Headwinds can cause the ball to veer off course, while tailwinds can push it in the desired direction. Crosswinds can move the ball both left or right, leading to unwanted hook or slice shots.\nGolfers can compensate for wind’s effect on direction by adjusting their shot aim and club selection to account for the wind’s direction and speed.\nUltimately, understanding the influence of wind on a golf ball’s flight is critical to making informed decisions and executing successful shots on the course. In the next section, we will explore techniques for measuring and estimating wind’s impact on golf shots, as well as strategies for compensating and adapting for windy conditions.\nMeasuring the Impact: Wind’s Effect on Distance\nUnderstanding the relationship between wind and the distance a golf ball can travel is essential for successful performance on the course. Wind speed and direction can impact ball flight, either helping it travel further or hindering its distance potential.\nTo estimate the magnitude of wind’s effect on golf shots, it’s essential to evaluate the conditions of the course. Professionals use a wind gauge to measure the wind’s speed and direction, which can help in determining the required adjustments for shots.\n|Wind Speed||Effect on Distance|\n|Calm||No significant impact on distance|\n|1-5 mph||Small impact on distance, adjust aim slightly|\n|5-10 mph||Noticeable impact on distance, adjust club selection and aim|\n|10-20 mph||Significant impact on distance, adjust club selection and aim significantly|\n|20+ mph||Extreme impact on distance, consider changing strategy or postponing play|\nTo compensate for the effects of wind on distance, golfers can consider varying their shot’s trajectory using specific club types. For example, a low-trajectory shot with a less-lofted club can minimize the wind’s impact and help the ball fly further. Alternatively, a high trajectory shot with a more-lofted club can help the ball remain aloft for an extended period, allowing the wind to carry it further.\nOverall, understanding the relationship between wind and distance is critical for successful golf performance. By measuring the wind’s effects, estimating their magnitude, and selecting the appropriate club and shot trajectory, golfers can adjust their strategies to navigate windy conditions more effectively.\nWind’s Role in Golf Ball Trajectory\nWhen it comes to a golf ball’s trajectory, wind can play a significant role.", "score": 0.842190444, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:eda1a49e-1b91-46df-96bc-2499d90c8b2b>", "text": "There is a lateral water hazard that runs down the left side of the hole, and the green is well bunkered on the left.\nHole No. 9\nPar 4, Handicap 6\nFrom the Championship tee, the par-4 ninth measures 414 yards.

For all golfers, it consists of a pre-stroke — in which golfer choose which club they want and their stance — and the actual stroke. The stroke is a complex motion, and there is still disagreement on what constitutes a good golf swing. In “Work and Power Analysis of the Golf Swing,” Nesbit and Serrano suggest the golf swing has been studied by scientists and mathematicians who have developed various equations to help explain the complexity of the swing. It is generally agreed that a successful and consistent golf swing requires precise timing and mechanics, from the grip and position of one's fingers, to the position and movement of the feet. At any moment of the swing, whether back swing, down swing, or upswing anything can go wrong that will throw off the whole body and result in a miss hit.\nThe goal of the golf swing is to direct as much kinetic energy as possible into the club head so when it comes into contact with the ball, all of the energy will transfer to the ball, sending it into flight. The complex motion of the body first starts with the stance. This is critical to make sure the golfer has a low center of gravity to remain balanced throughout the swing path. The swing starts with the arms moving back in a straight line. When the club head reaches the level of the hip, two things happen: there is a stern wrist cock that acts as a hinge along with the left knee (for a right handed swing), building up its torque by moving into the same line as the belly button before the start of the upswing. As the swing continues to the top of the backswing (again for right handed golf swing), the golfer's left arm should be perfectly straight and his right arm should be hinged at the elbow. The downswing begins with the hips and the lower body rather than the arms and upper body, with emphasis on the wrist cock. As the golfer's hips turn into the shot, the right elbow will drop straight down, hugging the right side of the golfer's torso. As the right elbow drops, the wrists begin to snap through from the wrist cock in the backswing.", "score": 0.840997, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:91701c94-0ffa-4f9d-87ec-ea898c47b52c>", "text": "The left arm is the primary control arm in the golf swing because the only the core rotation you're then going to focus on adding the lead arm into your golf swing.

Sequencing can be a powerful element within a golf swing, and some of the players you watch on TV have learned this well. Even when you see professional golfers who have different technical elements within their swings, you will notice that the general sequence in which they do things is similar from player to player. Getting the sequencing in a good place can help maximize your potential as a golfer.\nPutting together a nicely sequenced golf swing isn’t easy, but it can be difficult if you don’t understand a fine order of operations. The following steps will hopefully walk you through getting the club and body to work together, all leading up to a powerful impact with the ball.\nStep #1 – Club First\nThe take-a-way doesn’t really matter all that much, but in general some say the golf club should be the first thing to move back away from the ball. Of course, in order to move the club, your body is going to have to move as well – but make it a subtle, quiet move. Ideally, they say to move the club back with a turn of your shoulders with a one-piece take-a-way, where your hands and arms won’t get involved until the club is well into the back swing motion.\nStep #2 – Full Turn\nMaking a full turn in your backswing is an important part of maxing out golf swing speed. One goal during your backswing can be to create the greatest possible comfortable difference between the turn of your shoulders and the position of your hips – in other words, you would see your hips move very little, while getting a full turn back from your upper body. When that is accomplished, you can be in a good position to uncoil aggressively and ramp up your speed into the ball.\nIf you are unable to create the type of turn you would like in your golf swing, it’s okay to allow the hips to open more and rear leg straighten to get the upper body further back, but you can also work on your fitness and flexibility – by improving the physical capabilities that your body possesses, you can improve your swing.\nStep #3 – Legs Start the Downswing\nThis is where some amateur golfers go wrong.", "score": 0.01977965674393006, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:afe86819-58a0-441b-ab0f-8176510a34a0>", "text": "You can practically follow all of the greatest golf swing tips, but only experienced players understand that great swinging is also not just in your hands. It is a complete body motion. Even the most accomplished professional players will admit that improving their golf swing takes more than just arm strength. Improving your upper body strength is a definite plus, but to really take your game to the next level you must also work on your lower body. Here are two golf swing exercises that will help to strengthen your core muscles and prevent lower back injury.\nOne of the first golf swing exercises that we will begin with is the one-hand grip. This one-hand grip is very easy to do and can be done in a matter of seconds. Just hold the golf club with one hand and place the other hand behind your head. Now you just need to make sure that your dominant hand is on the club and that your fingers are together. You want to make sure that the club stays close to your body at all times.\nAnother exercise is going to the golf course and hitting some balls. This will allow you to repeat some of the basic swings that you may have already perfected. Once you are able to do this a few times you will find that you can get some improvement in your golf swing. If you want to really work out those abdominal muscles, you may want to try some of these golf swing exercises.\nThere are a lot of golf swing exercises that will focus on your backswing. When people think about improving their golf swing they think about strengthening their arms, getting more accurate with their backswing, and being able to keep the club straight during their backswing. But without strengthening your core muscles you are going to be at a disadvantage when it comes to hitting longer golf shots. By working out these muscles you will notice that you can create more power when you swing the golf club.\nThe first exercise that will focus on your backswing is going to be swinging with only one golf club. You will have someone holding the golf club with either a strap or a chin up bar. You want to be comfortable with the person holding the club and your own body. This will help you get into the proper swing position.

Is it necessary to swing as hard as you can in golf?\nNo, it is not necessary to swing as hard as you can in golf. In fact, many golfers are taught to swing at a controlled speed and use their muscles efficiently to achieve maximum power and accuracy. Swinging too hard can lead to poor control and accuracy, and may even result in injury.\n2. What is the correct way to swing a golf club?\nThe correct way to swing a golf club is to keep your body in balance and your muscles relaxed throughout the swing. Begin by gripping the club with your dominant hand and placing the other hand on the handle for support. Swing the club back, keeping your arms and shoulders relaxed, and bring it forward to strike the ball. As you follow through, keep your arms and body in line with the direction of the shot.\n3. How can I improve my swing in golf?\nTo improve your swing in golf, practice is key. Start by practicing your grip, stance, and swing motion in front of a mirror or with a golf pro. Pay attention to your body position and the position of the club throughout the swing. As you become more comfortable with the mechanics of the swing, focus on maintaining a consistent rhythm and tempo.

It can be difficult to estimate distance and sometimes a power line is closer than it looks. Use a spotter to make certain you stay far away from power lines.\n- Always lower portable augers or elevators to their lowest possible level, under 14 feet, before moving or transporting them. Wind, uneven ground, shifting weight or other conditions can cause you to lose control of equipment and make contact with power lines.\n- Be aware of increased height when loading and transporting larger modern tractors with higher antennas.\n- Never attempt to raise or move a power line to clear a path. If power lines near your property have sagged over time, call your utility to repair them.\n- Don’t use metal poles when breaking up bridged grain inside and around bins.\n- As in any outdoor work, be careful not to raise any equipment such as ladders, poles or rods into power lines. Remember, non-metallic materials such as lumber, tree limbs, tires, ropes, and hay will conduct electricity depending on dampness and dust and dirt contamination.\n- Use qualified electricians for work on drying equipment and other farm electrical systems.\n- If you are on equipment that makes contact with a power line, do not exit the equipment.

In Texas, a fourth worker was also buried in grain, but was rescued and survived. Suffocation from engulfment is a leading cause of death in grain bins, and the number of these deaths continues to rise. In fact, the number of deaths more than doubled between 2006 and 2010. These fatalities are preventable if employers follow work practices and provide training and equipment as required by OSHA's Grain Handling Facilities standard, 29 CFR 1910.272.\nHow are workers suffocated or engulfed in grain bins?\nSuffocation can occur when a worker enters a bin and is engulfed by grain or when bins develop hazardous atmospheres or do not have enough oxygen. A worker can be engulfed or suffocated if the worker enters the bin and:\n- Stands on moving/flowing grain and the moving grain acts like \"quicksand\" and buries the worker in seconds\n- Entering a bin while the auger is operating is dangerous. As the auger unloads the bin, grain flows to the outlet and is released, causing the grain above it to flow in and replace the released grain. When a worker stands on flowing grain, their weight forces the grain supporting them to flow to the outlet more quickly, causing them to rapidly sink into the grain. According to one source, at the average flow rate for grain, a 6-foot tall worker can be covered with grain in 11 seconds and would be unable to free him/her self after the first 5 seconds.1\n- Stands on or below a \"bridging\" condition that collapses and buries the worker\n- \"Bridging\" occurs when grain clumps together, because of moisture or mold, creating an empty space beneath the grain as it is released. Bridged grain resists the downward pull that normally moves loose grain to the bin outlet and rarely becomes hard enough to support a person. If a worker steps onto the bridge, it can cave in under the worker's weight, burying him or her in the empty space.", "score": 0.842449963, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:9b599c08-8319-45a0-8cd0-5b32307a5834>", "text": "Water has \"buoyancy,\" which \"floats\" ships and helps lifeguards rescue victims much larger than themselves. Grain does not have these properties and resists the force a rescuer uses when trying to remove a buried worker. Rescue systems should therefore be designed and built to overcome this resistance. A rescuer's strength alone is not likely to be enough to rescue a trapped worker.\nOSHA requirements: How can employers reduce hazards and protect workers entering grain storage bins?\nUnder the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees.\nOSHA’s Grain Handling Facilities standard sets requirements that employers must follow to protect and train workers exposed to the hazards of grain handling facilities. The standard establishes common-sense safety practices and specific controls that can prevent worker injuries and deaths, and identifies specific controls for engulfment hazards that are covered below. OSHA's standard also covers controls for other common issues at these facilities, including: dust accumulation and explosions, hazardous atmospheres, confined space entry, and emergencies.\nStates that operate their own occupational safety and health programs approved by Federal OSHA enforce similar standards but may have different or additional requirements. A list of State plans is available.\nEntering grain storage bins is EXTREMELY DANGEROUS. To reduce the risk of engulfment and suffocation, do not allow workers to enter a grain storage bin unless it is absolutely necessary.

Otherwise, the air will not be able to pick up additional moisture as it passes through the pile.\nFarmers hoping to reduce moisture content of binned grain using aeration should always ensure that the bin is adequately vented so moist, warm air can exit the structure after it has been forced through the grain.\nIf the bin roof panels are cold, moisture can condense on the under side from the warm humid air and drip back onto the top of the grain in the bin.\nIn crops that have yet to be harvested, the temperature of grain coming off the combine will be an important factor. In many cases, grain that comes off cool with excess moisture will require artificial drying that uses natural gas, propane or some other heat source.\nConditioning costs vary from elevator to elevator, but in most cases, grain terminals will dry grain at posted rates or they will blend tough grain with other grain that was dry at the time of delivery.\nMost elevator locations give priority to producers who also agree to market their grain through that delivery point.\nOn-farm drying or custom drying may be the only other option for producers who are not in a position to deliver or sell their grain immediately.\nAccording to Saskatchewan Agriculture, artificial heat sources can be added to aeration fans to achieve some level of drying.\nIn those cases, producers should follow basic rules:\n- Limit the increase in air temperature to 10 C.\n- Ensure that the minimum air temperature entering the grain is at least 5 C and preferably 10 C.\n- Ensure that the maximum air temperature entering the grain bin does not exceed 24 C.\n- Ensure that the air flow entering the grain is at least one cubic foot per minute per bushel.

The team had André 3000 and Big Boi rap over them, which led to a record deal from LaFace for both Organized Noize and OutKast.

The studio featured mostly secondhand recording equipment. Recording sessions also took place at Bosstown, Dallas Austin‘s D.A.R.P. Studios, Doppler Studios, and Purple Dragon in Atlanta. Located in midtown Atlanta, Bosstown developed a sentimental value for Outkast, who later bought the studio in 1999 and renamed it “Stankonia” after their fourth studio album.

During the early 1990s, the scene was largely discredited by the rest of the hip hop community as misogynistic and inferior to other scenes, particularly East Coast and West Coast hip hop. Those scenes dominated the hip hop market, and acts from other regional scenes were often produced by either East Coast or West Coast producers. The album offered an artistically credible alternative, both musically and lyrically, to those regional scenes and was produced by an Atlanta-based production team. Music journalist T. Hasan Johnson notes “Outkast’s first submission to the music industry” as significant for how they “broke from the binary production options split by California and New York artists”, viewing that their decision to boast their region and a native production team “signaled a break from the conventional split between East and West hip hop aesthetics and openly demonstrated that the South could produce street-certified, quality music.” Nicole Hodges Persley cites its release as a critical moment in hip hop and writes that it “marked a break in bicoastal hip hop sound”.\nThe album presaged hip hop’s “Dirty South” aesthetic, which later achieved mainstream recognition. Its smooth musical style, drawing on soul and funk musical traditions, and the duo’s clever lyrics helped define Southern hip hop’s sound, which influenced acts like Goodie Mob, Joi, and Bubba Sparxxx.

In 1995, Big Boi (mainly known for his work with OutKast) grouped up with members of Goodie Mob (Cee-Lo, T-Mo, Khujo, and Big Gipp) for the record, “Dirty South.” It would go on to be one of the classic records that gave southern rap music its face and make the careers of both the acts blossom. At ONE this year, the 6 came on stage together to remind the crowd what came before all the Futures and Young Thugs of today.\nOrganized Noize Haven’t Lost a Single Step\nTo the younger rap fans of today may not be familiar with one of the higher names on the lineup, Organized Noize.

The secret to their universal appeal is their wide range of influences, which together combine into a cohesive style. The style, like that of the Dirty South in general, contains the best elements of New York and Los Angeles rap.\n1994 – ‘Southernplayalisticadillacmusik’ brought us some original beats, with some ill rhymes from the Dre/Big Boi duo. The title track and others such as ‘Funky Ride’ showed us that Outkast were always going to be different.\nThe scratching and the jazz influences are quite reminiscent of groups like ‘A Tribe Called Quest’ or ‘The Roots’ whilst the instrumental feel and the groovy bass lines are pure g-funk era. In fact Organized Noize, Outkast’s production team, school other rap groups on how to use a wide variety of instrumentation. Check out the electric guitar on ‘Funky Ride’, the organs on the title track and the bass on “Ain’t No Thang” from the Southernplayalisticadillacmusik album. This style still continues with ‘Stankonia.’ The tunes created on Stankonia are generally far funkier, with a quicker, in yer face beat. The highly under-rated ‘Bombs Over Baghdad (B.O.B.)’ is a perfect example of this. However they still have a couple of mellow chill tracks such as the massive ‘Miss. Jackson’. The Atlanta based crew, also produce some highly original lyrics, deterring immensely from the traditional ‘Gangsta Rap’ to simply rapping about life, love and losses, and they pull it off without the help of other big artists featuring in the tracks. 1996 – ‘ATliens‘ was a much less known affair, with the title track ‘ATliens’ probably the only known track on it. However, the duo did manage to maintain the funky tunes from their last album.\n1998 – Outkast once again found success with this album, Aquemini, hitting no. 2 in the US Billboard 200 chart.

Goodie Mob's next album, World Party (1999), was more commercially crafted, trading in some of the social commentary of past albums for good-time festivity. Organized Noize continued to produce, along with Bad Boy associate Deric \"D-Dot\" Angelettie (and his co-producer, Kanye West, who earns an early credit on the track \"Rebuilding\"), and featured guests include TLC (on \"What It Ain't [Ghetto Enuff]\") and Big Boi from OutKast (\"Get Rich to This\"). Despite the commercial considerations, World Party proved disappointing from both a critical and commercial perspective -- particularly the latter, for the album barely broke into the Top 50 of the Billboard 200 (peaking at number 48) and failed to spawn a hit that could crack the Hot 100 singles chart (\"Get Rich to This\" was the only single to chart at all).\nThe disappointment of World Party brought Goodie Mob's tenure at LaFace to an unfortunate end.

The album was a return to Goodie Mob's earlier style of conscious Southern rap, though it lacked the production finesse of Organized Noize as well as the major-label budget of LaFace, and met an unfortunate fate, selling poorly and generally falling upon deaf ears.

They are: the amount of commercial kitchen space allotted for this item, the size and type of foodservice business you own, your refrigerated goods delivery schedule and the amount of perishable goods you use in food prep.\nCommercial refrigeration units come with one, two and three doors, the number of doors will determine the width of the refrigerator. So, exact measurements of your commercial kitchen space, with some inches around for ventilation, would be needed to determine the refrigerator size you could hold. You would then need to determine if that size is adequate for your needs. You would also need to have accurate knowledge of your weekly inventory, your usage and your budget. For example, if you get daily deliveries of perishable goods, such as fish for your seafood restaurant, that is cooked immediately, then you won't need as much refrigeration as a restaurant that gets weekly deliveries.\nIdeally your commercial refrigerator will be easy for your food service staff to get into and out of, as well as be easy to organize for your particular type of food preparation. Depending on the size of your space and your storage requirements, you may find that you need a walk-in refrigerator, which you could even place in the back of your restaurant. Additionally, casters placed on the bottom of heavy commercial refrigerators can increase their accessibility by making them more mobile.\nThe compressor is the part of the refrigerator that keeps it cold and in commercial refrigerators you can find those with the compressor located either on the top or the bottom of the unit.\nIn a top-mount unit, the compressor and condensing unit are on the top of the appliance, giving you more interior storage space, and keeping the area around the refrigerator cooler. Because these components are on the top of the refrigerator, they have better compressor airflow which results in higher energy efficiency in cool environments. They also allow under-the-unit cleaning and are often chosen for kitchens that tend to have a dusty environment, such as a bakery. A disadvantage of this type of compressor is that the refrigerator cavity will be lower down, meaning more bending and stooping in order to reach refrigerated items by you and your kitchen staff.\nIn a bottom-mount unit, the compressor and condensing unit are located at the bottom of the appliance, therefore the refrigerator cavity is usually smaller than the cavity of a top-mount refrigerator.", "score": 0.848978877, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:b028cb9c-7a38-4481-af5d-cb818e82db4d>", "text": "ICBIT-30CIID Tall Refrigerator/Freezer\n- Height 2134 (mm)\n- Energy Class A+\n- Volume Fridge Net 475 (L)\n- Transport Weight 181 (kg)\n- Electrical Connection 13 (Amp)\n- Width 762 (mm)\n- Energy Use 159 (kWh/yr)\n- Temperature Fridge 1 to 7 (˚C)\n- Voltage 220-240 (V)\n- Door Clearance 724 (mm)\n- Depth 610 (mm)\n- Decibel Rating 42\n- Shelve Depth 310 (mm)\n- Electrical Load 2.2 (Amp)\n- Depth Including Doors 610 (mm)", "score": 0.847541, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:6efc51e8-d84c-481a-8d95-688ef958569a>", "text": "SEER vs EER\nWhat is the relationship between the SEER rating of a heat pump and the EER rating.

Think of a refrigerator as analogous to a car, and the wattage of the compressor as analagous to the horsepower of the engine. You can’t predict the gas mileage of the car based on the horsepower. Similarly, “watts consumed by refrigerator” only tells you how much power the refrigerator draws while the compressor runs, not what the unit will use over a given time period or how long the payback period will be.\nJust as two cars with the same horsepower can have radically different gas mileage, two refrigerators with exactly the same compressor (not just the same wattage) can have different energy efficiency. How much insulation does each refrigerator have? How many cubic feet of interior space? How is that space divided between the fridge and freezer compartments? How good are the gaskets? All these factors will affect your refrigerator energy usage and payback period for an upgrade to a more efficient model, much more than the compressor wattage.\nTo determine the watts consumed by a refrigerator over a time period – typically per month – look at the energy efficiency rating provided by the manufacturer. This rating should be provided on an EnerGuide or other data sheet provided with the refrigerator. It will list the kilowatt hours consumed per year. Multiply that figure by your price per kilowatt hour to get the cost per year for running the refrigerator.\nIf you’re comparing two new refrigerators it’s relatively easy to determine the payback period for buying the more expensive one. Let’s assume there are two refrigerators you’re considering, the Inglis I8RXCGFXQ top freezer (475 kwh per year, $549 price tag) and the Whirlpool G9RXXFMWB top freezer (343 kwh per year, $779 price tag).", "score": 0.844293654, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:9de976dc-4c59-4490-afd3-5048156b411c>", "text": "Energy-efficient fridges and freezers\nThis guide is intended to provide general guidance only.

They’re using electricity 24 hours a day, so it’s really important to make sure they’re running as efficiently as possible.\nAre today’s energy-saving fridges and freezers better than their older counterparts?\nYes – modern fridges and freezers are much more energy efficient than their ancestors, so if your fridge or freezer is more than 10 years old you might want to think about replacing it. The energy savings you’ll make could pay for cost of buying it within a few years.\nIn recent years, fridge and freezer manufacturers have improved insulation standards, introduced high-efficiency compressors and enhanced the mechanisms for temperature control and defrosting.

Easy-to-reach freezers and refrigerators can not only improve the efficiency of your service but also, in most cases, improve the quality of your servings.\nIf you are a business or commercial establishment, your refrigerator or freezer is likely to be among the most used equipment, and it is, therefore, essential for you to invest a considerable amount of time and energy in finding one with the appropriate configuration, compressors, and dimensions.\nBelow I have discussed a few important tips which I believe will help you in choosing a right commercial refrigerator for your business.\nThe market is flooded with engineering companies serving its customers with a range of products and options. As a customer or as a business, it is your responsibility to choose a brand that is trustworthy, has been in the business for years, respects the voice of its customers and has dedicated staff members to take care of its customers’ needs.\nThe first place where you will literally get all the information about a brand or company is the Internet. Start digging into the history of brands and current positions by visiting Wikipedia or any other trusted information site. Then look for reviews of any of their commercially available products. If 90 to 95% of the review is positive, it is a green signal. Remember, no company will ever be able to satisfy all their customers, and so a legitimate company will always have some three stars or four stars rating, and in my personal experience, it’s absolutely normal.\nNow take the time to find out what kind of guarantees the brand offers on its products. Also check if you receive a damaged product, or if something goes wrong, then will they provide you with the necessary repairs and if it will cost you something.\nAs a company, you would always like to reduce your energy bills, and it is therefore important for you to look for the Energy Star symbol on the unit in question. Typically, commercial products should have an Energy Star rating of 3 to 5 (the higher the rating, the better). These devices are not only synonymous with energy efficiency, but also energy saving.\nDecide Condenser Location\nThe heart of any refrigeration system is its condenser because that is the only reason why your food and beverages are cold and safe inside the refrigerator.\nGenerally, in most refrigerators, the condensers are located at the top or bottom.", "score": 0.11047031782193431, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:2b54bd7a-2d18-446c-9fdf-16445f0b7cbe>", "text": "Samsung, India’s No. 1 refrigerator brand, today announced that it became the first brand in India to receive a 5-Star rating by Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) for its 653L Convertible 5-in-1 Side-by-Side refrigerator.

The appliance you choose must be able to save money and reduce your carbon footprint. This guide will help you make an informed decision about which appliances are best for saving energy in your household.\nUnderstanding Energy Efficiency\nUnderstanding the difference between energy efficiency and power consumption is important when choosing appliances that are right for your needs. When you want to save money on your utility bills, you should purchase an appliance with a high Energy Star rating.\nThis means it uses less energy than other models even though it has higher wattage because of its design or features like LED lights which use much less electricity than incandescent bulbs. Purchasing an appliance with lower wattage will also help you save energy without sacrificing performance.\nHow To Choose An Energy Star Appliance\nA useful guideline is to choose appliances with an Energy Star rating of 75 or more.\nAnother good tip for saving energy is choosing the right size and brand for your home, in order to avoid leaving items plugged in when not in use. For example, if you have a large family but only one refrigerator, consider buying two smaller fridges instead of one big fridge that stays on all day long (even when it’s not needed).\nAnother way to save money and reduce carbon emissions is by purchasing products made from recycled content materials; this ensures that fewer raw resources are used up while still making sure the product performs as well or better than its non-recycled counterparts.\nChoosing between different brands of products is important, as some brands are more energy-efficient than others. Energy-efficient brands include Samsung, LG, and Whirlpool.\nThe Most Energy-Efficient Appliances\nThe Environmental Protection Agency has a list of appliances that are the most efficient.\nA washing machine may use less water and electricity per load than a clothes dryer.\nThe refrigerator can be placed on its side to increase fridge space without increasing power usage (although this depends on your country’s laws). A refrigerator does use energy when the compressor switches on periodically throughout the day but operates much less frequently than a freezer (which has no defrost cycle).\nA water heater is energy efficient because it only heats water when you need it. As the folks at thinktankhome.com explain, for instance, a water heater is a large contributor to your energy bill (about 25%) so if you can conserve energy or replace your system with a more cost-effective model, you’ll be able to directly impact your monthly expenses.", "score": 0.0026785560657135946, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:b3a39f0c-ace1-42a4-9862-4e619eb4438f>", "text": "There are two rebates to choose from:\n- Get a $100 rebate on the purchase of an ENERGY STAR® certified refrigerator rated 15% better than the federal standard.

They are a constructive version of the so-called energy pyramids, using the proportion of the golden section as a shaping parameter, which provides the possibility of accumulating (speculating) the hypothetical anomalous energy caused by the shape of the pyramid. A distinctive feature of the use of the golden section in the Famine pyramids is its application to the ratio of the diameters of neighboring balls that are successively inscribed in the pyramid. When this condition is fulfilled, the ratio of the height of the pyramid to the side of the square lying at its base is approximately equal to two, and the angle between the faces of the pyramid is about 27.3 degrees. According to A.Golod, this configuration of the pyramid, taking into account the relatively large dimensions of the structure, ensures maximum efficiency of its energy impact.\nThe Pyramids of Golod caused a wide public response in connection with the numerous publications and statements of the author about the discovery of supernatural opportunities for the beneficial effects of his pyramids on processes in living and inanimate nature, as well as on physical phenomena that contradict the basic laws of nature.\nThe Seliger pyramid was installed in the summer of 1997 near the town of Ostashkov on the shore of Lake Seliger.", "score": 0.0019278798347620132, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:6d509cd3-7d74-4acf-a0f8-1ea9e3021fca>", "text": "You are hereRefrigeration and freezing: Products & Services for United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland\n4-star freezer compartment\nFresh food can be frozen and kept in long-term storage in the 4-star freezer compartment.

Withdrawals must be curtailed where they are causing problems.\n2) Will regulations follow in a reasonable time frame? The artesian well sections of Phase 2 of the existing act still have no regulations over 5 years later.\n3) More money will have to be raised from the users (paying higher rates for water) either initially or soon (I can see the rationale for a lower introductory rate with escalation over a reasonable period of time to allow users to adjust their operations) in order to pay for enforcement and rehab efforts. Eventually, it would make sense for large users to pay close to what it would cost to use municipal water less the cost of treatment.\n4) Is there the will to enforce the act and provide personnel in the field? We cannot afford a repeat of the fiasco going on at DFO where the government spends money on layers of bureaucracy and public relations while abandoning work in the field.

So going to the excellent Hutton and Varughese ‘The Costs of Meeting the 2030 Sustainable Development Goal Targets on Drinking Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene, World Bank, 2016 I find the answer quite easily “The total capital cost of meeting targets 6.1 and 6.2 is $114 billion per year (range: $74 to $166 billion). So taking the 15 year period in which to achieve the targets this comes out at $1,710 billion – trillions indeed (well almost).\nBut then I read that “The total cost estimates include the resources required to put in place, operate, and maintain a WASH service for those without the service in 2015. The costs of maintaining access for those already served by a given service level in 2015 are excluded from the calculations.” Reasonable to make that assumption, really appreciating how the authors are quite explicit (and detailed) in the assumptions they have had to make.\nBut it left me wondering, as everywhere I travel to work there is massive unfunded OpEx and CapManEx, particularly the latter with so much renewal, rehabilitation and replacement maintenance required.

Today, the value of world monetary gold stocks is only 1.7% ($1.28 trillion) compared to global GDP of $73.9 trillion. I calculated the value of present monetary gold stocks by multiplying the current 33,250 metric tons of official gold holdings by $1,200 an ounce. Of course, we don’t know the TRUE official gold holdings figure, but this at least provides us a guideline.\nIf we look at another quotation from the U.S. Bureau Of Mines 1932-33 Gold-Silver Mineral Yearbook, they provide the exact figure of world gold and silver monetary stocks for 1931:\nWhat is interesting about this excerpt was the inclusion of monetary silver. According to the data, monetary silver accounted for 25% of total monetary stocks in 1932. Of the $16 billion in world monetary gold and silver stocks, the United States held $4.9 billion or roughly one-third of global monetary stocks.\nNow, where do I arrive at the figure that suggests gold is undervalued 20 times compared to 1929. As stated above, the value of world monetary gold stocks in 1929 was a third of global GDP. A third of global GDP in 2015 would equal $24.6 trillion. If we divide $24.6 trillion by $1.28 trillion in current world monetary gold stocks, we get 19.2…. or 20, if we round it up nicely.\nWhich means, the current gold price of $1,200 multiplied by 20 = $24,000 an ounce. Thus, the gold price would be $24,000 an ounce today if it were to equal the same ratio to global GDP in 1929. While it is true that the Western Central Banks publicly regard gold as a “Barbarous Relic”, privately they quite likely believe the opposite.\nSo, what does comparing monetary gold stocks to global GDP really mean? Well, let’s look at one more section from the 1932-33 Gold-Silver Minerals Yearbook:\nBasically, money should be “a medium of exchange and a standard by which future obligations are determined.” Well, money today doesn’t perform this function any longer.

This is as a result of monetary tightening implemented by CBN in 2011 and further tightening could increase lending cost to private sector and further constrain economic activities.\nGlobal growth prospect remain fragile and weak. Developments in the global economy are still of concern as most advanced economies are projected to show a lower rate of growth in 2012. The latest IMF estimates project growth in advanced economies to decelerate to 1.2 percent in 2012 from 1.6 percent recorded in 2011. The Euro-area would be the hardest hit on the back of high public debt and fragile financial market.

The sales volume is the highest on record since it was first introduced in the country in 2002. The monetary amount of the sales is also the de facto highest, since the price per ticket was halved to 1,000 won from 2,000 won after the previous annual record in 2003.\nExact and detailed figures are due out in February.\nLotto sales had plummeted from 2003 after the government restricted the carryover of winning prize money.

In 2015, sales increased to 3.25 trillion won.\nSocial analysts say the return of Lotto’s popularity is relevant to the current slump in the country’s economy, hit by a worsening job market, household debts and slowing growth.

Depression currently ranks fourth among the major causes of disability worldwide, after lower respiratory infections, prenatal conditions, and HIV/AIDS. Crocus sativus L. is used to treat depression. Many medicinal plants textbooks refer to this indication whereas there is no evidence-based document. Our objective was to compare the efficacy of stigmas of Crocus sativus (saffron) with imipramine in the treatment of mild to moderate depression in a 6-week pilot double-blind randomized trial. METHODS: Thirty adult outpatients who met the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition for major depression based on the structured clinical interview for DSM IV participated in the trial. Patients have a baseline Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression score of at least 18. In this double-blind, single-center trial, patients were randomly assigned to receive capsule of saffron 30 mg/day (TDS) (Group 1) and capsule of imipramine 100 mg/day (TDS) (Group 2) for a 6-week study. RESULTS: Saffron at this dose was found to be effective similar to imipramine in the treatment of mild to moderate depression (F = 2.91, d.f. = 1, P = 0.09). In the imipramine group anticholinergic effects such as dry mouth and also sedation were observed more often that was predictable. CONCLUSION: The main overall finding from this study is that saffron may be of therapeutic benefit in the treatment of mild to moderate depression. To the best of our knowledge this is the first clinical trial that supports this indication for saffron.", "score": 0.00046330492801714826, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:ad884a41-ba3b-4600-ad39-56daffcd5b78>", "text": "There are many saffron benefits associated with this wonderful ancient flower. Saffron is uncanny in its classification as a spice since saffron’s nature rather resembles that of an herb. Unlike other spices, it is neither gleaned from seeds, barks, roots, or any other hard or seemingly impregnable plant matter. Rather it is comprised of the dried stigmas of the saffron crocus (Crocus sativus). Typically characterized by their deep crimson appearance, the stigmas of the ivory-white and purple crocus flower are harvested by hand during blossoming.\nSaffron, the exotic golden spice, can do more than just add color and flavor to your dishes.\nMoreover, it has been valued in traditional Asian medicine for its incredible health benefits. Modern science has also begun to recognize the power of saffron’s bioactive compounds such as crocin, crocetin, picrocrocin, and safranal.\nMore Saffron Benefits\nSaffron can treat gastric disorders, lower depression, improve symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, reduce insulin resistance, and protect the heart.\nSaffron belongs to the iris family, and has had a plethora of saffron benefits throughout millennia. As far back as the writings of Galen and Hippocrates, saffron was mentioned as a medical treatment for coughs, colds, stomach ailments, insomnia, uterine bleeding, scarlet fever, heart trouble, and flatulence.\nNaturally, one of saffron’s first uses may have been for dyeing textiles, since a single grain can color 10 gallons of water with a distinctive yellow hue. More than a grain is used, however, to color the bright orange robes worn by Buddhist priests in India. Three wispy saffron “threads” can be gleaned from each delicate crocus, which, ironically, is lavender-purple in color.\nAs a spice, saffron is known for what it does to energize dishes with a pungent, earthy essence.\nWhy so expensive, you may ask? Because the cultivation and harvest is still performed as it was since ancient times: by hand. Elderly village women are usually set on this task of removing the saffron “threads.” It takes 4,500 crocus flowers to make up one ounce of saffron spice.", "score": 0.000415235333897291, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:fad35870-5af9-426c-81bb-54496d8a2b57>", "text": "Saffron is a spice derived from the stigmas and stalks of the saffron crocus (Crocus sativus) flower.

In its powdered commercial form the rate of thickening and the final-viscosity reflect the process history of the product, including the particle size of the powder. See Fig. 2 for typical swell curves of a range of available products.\nHeating a guar gum solution reduces the time needed to reach its full viscosity potential.\nWater is the only common solvent for guar gum, although it will tolerate limited concentrations of water-miscible solvents, such as alcohols. Dimethylformamide and dimethylsulfoxide are solvents as they are for most other polymers.\nCommercial guar gum solutions are typically turbid. The turbidity is largely caused by the presence of insoluble portions of the endosperm. Polymer solutions, intensively purified in the laboratory by noncommercial methods, approach water clarity.\nDerivatives of guar gum can show dramatically different solubilities and clarities in solution. There are hydroxyalkyl derivatives available, much clearer than guar gum, capable of tolerating major proportions of water-miscible solvents. Carboxymethyl derivatives in general are much clearer than guar gum. Improved clarity results from derivatization and solubilization of insoluble seed impurities. Changes in solubility occur when sufficient hydroxyl groups of the galactomannan are substituted and the new polymer takes on some of the characteristics of the derivatizing reagent.\nGuar gum is one of the most highly efficient water-thickening agents known. Solutions of guar gum and its derivatives are non-Newtonian, classed as pseudoplastic. They thin reversibly when heat is applied and degrade irreversibly with time when an elevated temperature is maintained. Some of the recently developed hydroxy-alkyl derivatives resist such degradation to a much greater degree. Solutions resist shear degradation well compared to other water-soluble polymers, but they will degrade with time under high shear. Figures 1.2 show viscosity and shear properties of guar gum.\nFig. 2: Viscosity development as a function of time for typical guar products.

In a way they represent the past and the future.\nTo start with the former: in many parts of Europe the viola da gamba was on its way out. The Viennese court was under strong Italian influence, and in Italy the viola da gamba had sunk into almost complete oblivion. But the Viennese emperors loved the instrument, and this explains that even music for viol consort was written for the court. The Hamburger Ratsmusik has devoted a whole disc to this repertoire. The gamba was also used as an obbligato instrument in large-scale vocal works. This programme contains an impressive example by Johann Joseph Fux, the aria 'Senta nel core' from his opera La decima fatica d'Ercole. This aria which lasts more than 11 minutes is a vocal tour de force, but it is especially the virtuosic gamba part which attracts the listener's attention. And that was probably as it was meant to be. Also interesting is an early example of a vocal piece with a concertante keyboard part, Di quel trono from La Placidia by Attilio Ariosti. This and the harpsichord items in the programme bear witness to the role of the harpsichord at the court. It is reported that Leopold I was an accomplished harpsichord player. Charles VI directed musical performances from the harpsichord, playing himself the basso continuo. Joseph I's wife, Amalia Wilhelmina, of French origin, owned a personal notebook with harpsichord pieces. The two pieces by Georg Muffat are taken from this collection.\nA large part of this disc is devoted to the role of the chalumeau and the clarinet. They represent the future, as it were. It is often thought that the chalumeau is the predecessor of the clarinet, but that is not correct. For a period of time they coexisted. The chalumeau was to disappear during the third quarter of the 18th century, whereas the clarinet would become one of the favourite wind instruments of the late 18th century which lost nothing of its appeal in the romantic era.", "score": 0.801653564, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:57c31100-20c5-4b07-8119-34b01357577c>", "text": "Whilst many contemporaries considered Marais the foremost viola da gamba exponent of his day, there was a rival, some 16 years his junior, who now laid claim to his crown: antoine Forqueray. ‘Crabbed, whimsical and odd’ was Hubert le Blanc’s assessment of this awe-inspiring performer. He went further: ‘The viol was viewed with favour by King Louis XIV … the elder Marais for his Pieces, and the elder Forcroi for his Preludes preceding the Sonata. The one was said to have played like an Angel, and the other to have played like the Devil.’ Some of this diabolic virtuosity is evident in his works for the viola da gamba, stretching the technical limits of any performer now or then. Antoine’s son Jean-Baptiste, also a viola da gamba player, was clearly a chip off the old block in terms of musical talent. Given that Forqueray père was an intensely jealous man, proud, inflexible, cruel, and determined to be the greatest viola da gamba player ever, one can only imagine the sounds that filled the house during Jean-Baptiste’s lessons. Their strained relationship came to a head when Forqueray père succeeded in having his son imprisoned and later attempted to banish him from the kingdom for ten years on charges of debauchery and stealing from the houses of his patrons.\nSeemingly without any grudge, Forqueray fils published in 1747 his father’s gamba music under the title Piéces de Viole avec la Basse Continuë Composées par Mr Forqueray le Pere. Forqueray père composed more than 300 pieces, of which 29 have survived – three were added by Forqueray fils. For no doubt sound commercial reasons they were published in two different versions: one for viola da gamba with basso continuo and the other as transcriptions for solo harpsichord, perhaps made with the assistance of his accomplished harpsichordist wife, Marie-Rose Dubois. We have chosen to dip into both versions, dividing up the spoils between viola da gamba and harpsichord solo.\nJames Johnstone © 2013", "score": 0.801179051, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:ec1181b3-3495-4e1c-8595-467463b36afe>", "text": "This concerto makes use of a popular chamber music ensemble of the time (flute, violin, harpsichord), which Bach used on its own for the middle movement. The work may have benn written as early as 1719, to show off a new harpsichord by Michael Mietke which Bach had brought back from Berlin for the Cöthen court. It may also have been written for a competition at Dresden vying with the French composer and organist Louis Marchand, as the central movement utilizes one of Marchand's themes (Bach's rival fled before the comp-off could take place, apparently scared off).\nThe concerto is well suited throughout to showing off the qualities of a fine harpsichord and the virtuosity of its player, but especially in the lengthy solo 'cadenza' to the first movement. It seems well nigh certain that Bach, considered a great organ and harpsichord virtuoso, was the harpsichord soloist at the premiere, and this may have been the birth of solo keyboard concerto.\nAn earlier version, BWV 1050a, has innumerable small differences from its later cousin, but two main ones: there is no part for cello, and there is a shorter and less elaborate harpsichord cadenza in the first movement.

One of his pupils was the local burgomaster Willem van Hogendorp to whom he dedicated his sonatas op. 2. In 1674 he moved to Amsterdam, where that same year he published a collection of sacred works under the title Cantiones Sacrae as his op. 1, dedicated to the stadholder Willem III. In 1678 the poet Dirk Buysero commissioned Hacquart to write the music for his pastoral play De triomfeerende min, celebrating the Peace of Nijmegen (recorded by Camerata Trajectina). The work was dedicated to Constantijn Huygens, Willem III's chief counsellor, who became Hacquart's patron. In 1679 Hacquart moved to The Hague, the residence of the stadholder and his family. He acted as organist and choirmaster at a hidden Catholic church, and as music teacher. He published two other collections of music: the above-mentioned op. 2, Harmonia Parnassia, and Chelys, a collection of pieces for viola da gamba, as his op. 3. There is no trace of Hacquart from 1689 onwards, but there is circumstantial evidence that he died in 1701 or 1702.\nHarmonia Parnassia, which is the main subject of the present disc, includes ten sonatas. Six have the scoring of the trio sonata: two violins and bc. One sonata is for violin, viola, viola da gamba and bc, two for two violins, viola, bass viol and bc, and one for three violins, bass viol and bc. The bass viol has a double role: it reinforces the left hand of the keyboard - the bass notes as written down by the composer - but also has some independence. In this recording the viola parts are performed on the viola da gamba.

Severe dust storms can clog road traffic and send cars to the repair shop; it can clog lungs and send people to the emergency room; it can clog the skies and block sunlight.\nRegions rich in sand and waterborne sediments experience frequent dust storms, but dust can easily travel far from its source. Soils in the Amazon rainforest, for example, owe part of their existence to the Bodele Depression on the other side of the Atlantic. Asian dust often migrates across the Pacific Ocean to North America. But while dust can travel great distances, it can also linger in the same region where it originated.\nDust plumes hovered over the ocean off southwestern Alaska in early November 2012. The Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Aqua satellite observed dust over Bristol Bay on November 6, and dust over the Gulf of Alaska on November 7. While the dust over the Gulf of Alaska could easily be traced to sediments along the Copper River, the source of the dust over Bristol Bay was not as obvious.\nGlaciers are common in the region, and as they slowly grind over rocks, they wear away sediment. Meanwhile, river levels rise and fall with the seasons. In the autumn, river levels are falling, and sparse snow cover leaves glacial flour exposed and available for dust storms, which are common between late October and mid-November. “Something like 75 percent of the freshwater to the Gulf of Alaska comes from small, coastal rivers,” explained John Crusius of the U.S. Geological Survey at University of Washington, “and all of these rivers draining ‘glacierized’ landscapes would have deposits of glacial flour at this time of year.” The dust blowing away from the Copper River is an example of a dust storm arising from a regional source.\nThe dust over Bristol Bay, however, might have had a more distant origin. Santiago Gassó of Goddard Earth Sciences Technology & Research—who studies dust plumes in the Gulf of Alaska to better understand sources of iron in the ocean—was struck by the width of the Bristol Bay plume, as opposed to the relatively narrow plume blowing from the Copper River. Gassó saw the wide and diffuse plume over Bristol Bay and doubted that it could have a local source.", "score": 0.848013699, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:498c1f7c-df7e-4cab-aa3c-087ce831a93a>", "text": "Parts of the Arctic could see less snow and more rain sooner than expected\nMost of the Arctic will be rain-dominated by the end of the century if the planet keeps to the current trajectory for 3 degrees C of warming.\nThe Arctic is often thought of as a cold, white and snowy region, but this image is rapidly changing. The Arctic is currently warming much faster than the rest of the planet and is experiencing rapid sea ice loss.\nAs a climate scientist and modeler, I am interested in what drives the Arctic climate and how it is expected to change with continued global warming. In our most recent study, my colleagues and I found that precipitation in the Arctic is changing more rapidly than was previously projected.\nIn the Arctic, most precipitation falls in the form of snow. But the Arctic is quickly transitioning to a rain-dominated climate. In August, for example, it rained at the summit of Greenland’s ice sheet for the first time. These changes will have huge implications on land, for wildlife and for human livelihoods.\nPast, present and future climate\nEarlier studies generally agree that precipitation will increase in the Arctic throughout this century and that this will more likely fall as rain than snow. But with the recent release of new data, we wanted to know how these projections may have changed.\nThis data is generated through the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, known as CMIP for short, and is freely open and accessible to all. This project essentially generates data, based on the same initial conditions, from about 50 centers around the world to better understand past, present and future climate.\nThe data generated by these models provides information on current and future atmospheric and ocean temperatures, sea ice conditions and winds, to name only a few. The new model data is the output from the latest phase of this project, Phase 6, known as CMIP6, which we compared to the previous phase, Phase 5 or CMIP5.\nAs one can imagine, this means we have a lot of data, which when assessing the current and future climate is essential, because the climate and especially future climate change are difficult to predict. Nonetheless these models, which are like simulations, are the best representation of the climate we have.\nIn fact, we were able to show in this study that the model data used does a good job at simulating the observed climate as the average precipitation in the models is very similar to the observations.", "score": 0.846847773, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:3b3c3869-554f-41a7-934c-5e86db878f5c>", "text": "Subject: What effects will hurricane Mitch have Honduras in the furture?\nDate: Thu Nov 19 17:02:47 1998\nPosted by Meagan\nGrade level: 7-9\nSchool: No school entered.\nCity: Somerset State/Province: KY\nArea of science: Earth Sciences\nI've been hearing a much about hurricane Mitch and Honduras.\nSo, what effects will the recent hurricane have on the land and environment in Honduras in years to come?\nRe: What effects will hurricane Mitch have Honduras in the furture?\nCurrent Queue |\nCurrent Queue for Earth Sciences |\nEarth Sciences archives\nTry the links in the MadSci Library for more information on Earth Sciences.\nMadSci Home | Information |\nRandom Knowledge Generator |\nMadSci Archives |\nMad Library | MAD Labs |\nMAD FAQs |\nAsk a ? |\nJoin Us! |\nHelp Support MadSci\n© 1995-1998.

Water engulfs the block, creating an air pocket above it. “When that air cavity closes, it slaps shut and sends up a jet of water,” explains Bartholomaus. “And it’s that slapping shut of an air cavity that produces the strongest seismic signals.”\nThe seismic waves from icequakes have a signature distinct from those from earthquakes.

Just as the width of tree rings are good indicators of wet or dry years, the ratios of calcium to barium in each algal ring is an indicator of salinity conditions at the time it was formed because freshwater runoff is high in barium.\nChan collected specimens and analyzed the growth rings in the species Clathromorphum nereostratum, one that is widespread and long-lived, from the Aleutian Island of Akun along the border of Unimak Pass – the main pathway for Alaska Coastal Current to flow from the Gulf of Alaska into the Bering Sea. The Alaska Coastal Current (ACC) is a narrow counterclockwise current that hugs Alaska’s Coast and is generally somewhat brackish as it collects all of the freshwater runoff from slopes of Alaska’s Coastal Range as it flows around the Gulf.\nBy analyzing the ratio of barium to calcium in each annual ring using a mass spectrometer, Chan was able to show that the ACC has freshened considerably in recent years and to an extent unprecedented in the last 65 years, possibly as a result of accelerated glacial melting.

Patterns in the atmosphere such as the jet stream and storm tracks are, in part, dictated by those slow changes.\nElsner found that for every 1.8°F increase in ocean temperatures in the western Caribbean, 51 percent more tornadoes are reported from April-June in the Great Plains. In the Gulf of Alaska, each 1.8°F above normal corresponded with a 15 percent decrease in tornado reports.\nThat makes sense based on the dynamics needed to form tornadoes. Warm waters in the Gulf of Alaska tend to fuel blocking ridges and reduce the amount of wind shear severe storms need to ramp up. Meanwhile, warm Gulf of Mexico waters can steer more moisture to the Great Plains.\nThis past February, sea surface temperatures were near normal in the Gulf of Mexico and 1.8° to 3.6°F above normal in the Gulf of Alaska. That means the odds might be in favor of less tornado activity, though the outcome is far from certain. Elsner said ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Alaska were one of the factors that could affect a tornado season, but they’re far from the only one, explaining only a fraction how many tornadoes form in any year.\nEven in a quiet year, major tornadoes can still drive up damages and loss of life. In 2013, the incredibly destructive Moore and El Reno tornadoes in May as well as a rare November outbreak in the Ohio River Valley did just that.\nThe Moore tornado was an EF-5 tornado—the highest rating—that killed 25 and caused $2 billion in damage in and around Moore, Okla. Just 11 days later, the El Reno tornado formed in central Oklahoma and quickly expanded to 2.6 miles across, making it the widest tornado ever recorded. It killed 8, including 3 experienced storm chasers who were caught off-guard by its rapid expansion and sudden change of direction.\nAnd we’re only three years removed from the incredibly destructive 2011 tornado season.", "score": 3.773771409293469e-09, "source": "sparse"}]}

Matt’s mom and sister were present throughout all the bridal prep, along with all of Sami’s family and friends. That sounds like such a small thing, but the presence of both families throughout the day perfectly sets the stage for any wedding.\nThe Omni Bedford Springs Resort is gorgeous, both historic and luxurious. Samantha and Matt had selected the Spa Lawn for their wedding ceremony. It’s the perfect outdoor space, and both the groom’s room and the bridal prep room overlooked the lawn, so bride and groom could both peek out and watch their guests arrive (conveniently located so they also couldn’t see each other).\nSide note – this lawn is perfectly shaded in the late afternoon.

In fact, main routes of the Great Silk Roads uniting East and West passed through the territory of present-day Uzbekistan, which was one of the places, where the first civilizations emerged and developed. Uzbekistan’s territory is characterized by fertile land that is intensively developed by humans, by diversity of raw resources, presence of developed city culture, high level of handicraft industry and commodity-money relations. And it is these factors that predetermined main routes over which trade and exchange relations took place.\nDiscovery of the Western Regions (i.e. Central Asia) and formation of the Great Silk Roads is associated with the name of Zhang Qian, a Chinese diplomat, who was dispatched by the order of the emperor Wu Di to Bactria in 138 A.D. He was charged with a task of concluding an agreement with the Yuezhi concerning joint actions against the Xiongnu. All together, the whole journey of Zhang Qian to the Yuezhi lasted for more than 13 years. Although he could not persuade the the Yuezhi chieftain to undertake joint actions, he was nevertheless able to gather some valuable information concerning the states and peoples, living in the Western Regions. Consequently, the information obtained by Zhang Qian stirred an interest of the emperor and his functionaries, so that after some time the emperor once again decided to send him with the aim of establishing trade relations in the Western Region. By so doing the emperor was intending to increase Chinese influence there.\nIn such a way the system of international relations and communications was established, which, later on, was named as the Great Silk Roads.\nAs a result of these efforts quite close trade and cultural contacts were established with four great powers of the ancient world, i.e. Han Empire, Kushan Empire, Parthian Empire and Roman Empire. With a lapse of time the routes of the Great Silk Roads became the ones, on which not only trade took place, but also cultural relations were established. Along the Great Silk Roads travelled religious missionaries, scholars, musicians and many other individuals. However it should be noted that the functioning of the Great Silk Roads was not always stable and permanent.", "score": 0.9957607782575154, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:fb9bc7ac-c015-4da3-b93f-acca1075bf6d>", "text": "The area first appeared in world history when the early Mesopotamians established a colony there to mine the precious lapis lazuli that colored and decorated all their most precious objects, from the banner of Ur to the Ishtar Gate. That makes it the first place ever considered valuable enough for a projection of imperial power beyond the cultural boundaries of the metropole. But that’s just history – the written record – kingdoms and cultures rose and fell in the area long before anyone wrote about them.\nIt was part of the Persian Empire before becoming a center of Hellenistic culture under the Seleucids. In the second century BCE, a Chinese emissary by the name of Zhang Qian found that, “Its people cultivate the land and have cities and houses [an important measure of civilization in Chinese culture] … The people are poor in the use of arms and afraid of battle, but they are clever at commerce. ... The population of the country is large, numbering some 1,000,000 or more persons. The capital is called the city of Lanshi (Bactra) and has a market where all sorts of goods are bought and sold.” His report to the emperor, and description of the sophistication of the society and value of the goods, led the previously insular Chinese court to declare the Bactrian’s as worthy friends.\nThis was a critical turning point in world history. When the Chinese emperor decided to encourage contact with Bactria, his armies were sent to establish control over the uninhabited portions of the route and protect travelers along the way. Thus was the Silk Road created.\nAfghanistan’s role in world trade wasn’t limited to the opening of the Silk Road. The land sits at the T-crossing of the East-West Silk Road and the North-South trade route from Central Asia into India. All goods traveling overland between India, Europe, China, Japan, Persia, and everyone in between, went through what is today Afghanistan, where massive markets covered many square miles of ground. Managing the markets meant not only knowing business and taking care of basic needs, like sanitation, clean water, and food, it also meant providing complex financial services, from money-changing to investment instruments. Not to mention all the locals who got into the trade business themselves.

Bactria was especially important between about 600 bc and about ad 600, serving for much of that time as a meeting place not only for overland trade between East and West but also for the crosscurrents of religious and artistic ideas. Bactria’s capital was Bactra, also called Bactra-Zariaspa (modern Balkh, Afghanistan). Bactria was a fertile country, and a profusion of mounds and abandoned water channels testifies to its ancient prosperity.\nThe first written records of Bactria are Achaemenian. The region was probably subdued by Cyrus II the Great in the 6th century bc and remained an Achaemenian province for the next 200 years. When Alexander the Great defeated Darius III, the Bactrian satrap, Bessus, tried unsuccessfully to organize resistance in the East. Upon the death of Alexander (323 bc) Bactria passed under the rule of Seleucus I Nicator.\nAbout 250 bc either Diodotus, the Seleucid satrap of Bactria, or his son of the same name founded an independent kingdom. The Seleucid king Antiochus III the Great defeated their successor, the usurper Euthydemus, but continued to recognize his independence. Euthydemus’s successors advanced into the Hindu Kush and northwestern India, where they established the Indo-Greek branch of the kingdom. At the height of their power they ruled almost all of what is now Afghanistan, parts of Central Asia, and a large area in Pakistan. Consequently, Hellenistic influence on the culture of Central Asia and northwestern India has been considerable. Hellenistic traditions are especially evident in art, architecture, coinage, and script.\nSometime before 128 bc Greek rule north of the Hindu Kush was challenged by a people known to the Chinese as the Yuezhi. By 128 bc the Greeks had become Yuezhi tributaries, and soon afterward the Yuezhi occupied Bactria. They probably were an Iranian people and included the Tocharoi, whose name was subsequently applied to the whole area (Tocharian kingdom).", "score": 0.833722711, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:c33a7a06-970e-4bec-9aab-50afbe8e8004>", "text": "What happened to the bactrians?\nControl of these lucrative trade routes, however, attracted foreign interest, and in the 6th century BC the Bactrians were conquered by the Persians, and in the 4th century BCE by Alexander the Great.

Two of its significant cities that are still important today are Samarkand (in Uzbekistan) and Kunduz (in northern Afghanistan).\nWhat did the Greeks call Afghanistan?\nBactria, a huge area in todays’ Afghanistan, was the eastern edge of the ancient Greek empire, established by Alexander the Great. Alexander and his army began a massive military campaign in 334 B.C. which resulted in Macedonians establishing many Greek cities across a wide swath of Southeast Asia.\nWhere is the Bactrian treasure now?\nA new museum in Kabul is being planned where the Bactrian gold will eventually be kept.

Trade flourished in Ancient Rome towards the end of the Roman Kingdom during the Republic period around 509 BC.\nThe Roman Empire was established during the Imperial period. After its establishment in 27 BC, Trade became a predominant source of the Roman economy throughout most of its existence.\nWhat helped to establish Trade in Ancient Rome?\nAncient Romans lived across the Italian Peninsula. However, the Roman Empire extended from Portugal to Persia and Scotland to the Sahara Desert, one of the oldest civilizations.\nThe territory expanded to today’s European countries such as Spain, England, Wales, Germany, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, Austria, Croatia, Belgium, and the Netherlands. More significant parts of Poland, France, and Italy also were parts of the Holy Roman Empire.\nSimilarly, it extended to the coastal parts of Northern Africa up to countries such as Egypt and Libya. The extension continued up to the Balkans, including countries like Greece, Hungary, Turkey. The Mediterranean Sea, the Black Sea, Asia Minor were essential parts of the Roman Empire.\nThe Middle East, including countries like Syria, Iraq, Jordan, was also part of the Roman Empire. Thus, the Roman Empire had plenty of land and sea routes that facilitated Trade and helped flourish it to a great extent.\nThe expansion of the Roman territory into the Holy Roman Empire contributed to the development of Trade in Ancient Rome. As a result, the Roman Empire had plenty of both land and sea routes. Sea routes comprised the Mediterranean and the Black Sea.\nThe land routes were constructed across the Holy Roman Empire. Ancient Romans built about 83,000 kilometers of paved roads stretching from Scotland and passing Eastern Europe to Iraq, ending in Northern Africa.\nThe roads were constructed with long-lasting materials that formed systematically engineered highways that could resist traffic and exposure to several atmospheric changes. As a result, the amount of Trade increased.\nHow Trade Contributed to the Economy of Ancient Rome?\nBefore the Imperial period, the Roman economy was based primarily on Agriculture and Animal Husbandry. Ancient Rome had limited areas of plain lands that were farmable due to various mountain ranges passing through the area.\nAs a result, they adapted by rearing animals that need little space to survive, such as sheep, goats, and pigs. They planted crops that required little water to grow, such as barley, wheat, and fruits such as grapes and oranges.", "score": 0.827823162, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:be37f0df-f215-4dcf-8e64-2c19369399e0>", "text": "How did ancient Egypt shape the development of Greek culture?

Greeks began to trade and settle here in the latter part of the seventh century BC, and it became the earliest Greek settlement in Egypt. Here, Greeks lived in close contact with Egyptians for centuries, long before the establishment of Alexandria. Naukratis became a gateway for trade and exchange between Egypt and the peoples of the Mediterranean.\nHistory of Naukratis\nAccording to the Classical Greek historian Herodotus, in the mid-sixth century BC the Egyptian Pharaoh Amasis gave the town of Naukratis to Greeks from 12 different cities to live in, including land where non-resident traders could erect sanctuaries. However, archaeology attests the site’s existence already under Pharaoh Psammetichus (Psamtek) I, from at least 620 BC. Furthermore, Naukratis was not just a Greek but also an Egyptian town.\nNaukratis was frequented by traders from many Greek cities as well, no doubt, as by Phoenicians and Cypriots; it became famous for its elaborate symposia (dining parties) and beautiful hetairai (courtesans). Naukratis functioned as the main trading port in the Western Nile Delta until the foundation of Alexandria, and continued to be significant also throughout the Hellenistic and Roman periods. Officers (prostatai) appointed by the nine founding cities of the Hellenion administered the emporion (Greek trading post) at least from the time of Amasis. Imports into Egypt included wine, oil, and silver, and exports from Egypt included grain, flax, natron, papyrus, perfume and other semi-luxuries.", "score": 0.826865554, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:bfab1c36-3a5d-419f-a302-3d29e815dc0c>", "text": "Geography of China\nDo you know why China has such a large population?\nDo you know why the east part of China is much more developed than the other parts?\nDo you know why Chinese are traditionally conservative?\nDo you know why Chinese were not keen on conquering other nations in history?\nAll of these questions we can find their answers from this course.\nThis course is for foreign students who have little knowledge of China’s geography and have the interests to learn about it.\nThe goal of this course is to enable students to have some general knowledge of China’s geography, in terms of which they can have a better understanding of Chinese culture and customs, for different environments always give different characteristics to their residents.\nIn total, this course is made up by 4 parts:\na.

Interestingly Chinese civilization arose 500 later than Bactria around 2,500 BC. I hypothesize that Bactria was a conduit for the transmission of Mesopotamian culture into China. Before you scoff, realize that the silk route trade would later be the conduit for Buddhism, Manichaean Thought, Christianity, and Islam into China. We know next to nothing about the first Bactrians, but we do know about Alexander’s campaigns to subdue Bactria. He left behind massive fortresses and ten,thousand Greek Mercenaries who he banished there. The Greek-Bactrian kingdom lasted for a couple of centuries and played a pivotal role in fusing Indian Buddhism and Greek art and probably Philosophy. Their written artifacts barely survive, but we do know that in the 250’s two erudite greek scholars wrote greek language versions of Buddhist propaganda using using terms and phrases from Plato and Pythagorus. This greek culture became a center of Buddhist thought and missionary work. Bactria is where the jewish-christian prophet Mani went to learn Buddhism around 250 AD. Zarathustra is said to be born here. The sufi Movement is rooted here, this is the center from which the Barmakids translated Sanskrit texts into Arabic in the 700’s. This is either the birthplace of Mahayana Buddhism or one of the birthplaces around. This knew form of Buddhism arose around 100 AD and stressed Gnostic salvation.

No doubt its legionnaires were feared from Iberia to Galcantray. To fund military might the descendants of Romulus engaged in prolific international trade. Today, as globalization and international trade spark heated debates in capitals around the world, it is important to remember the long history of trade. From the Chinese to the Phoenicians, the Spaniards and the Dutch, the mighty British empire and the American industrial powerhouse, trade has been at the center of every great power in history. Great powers can either take that which they need by force, or buy it away. To most, trade is clearly preferable.\nSince its founding in 1948, the World Trade Organization (WTO) and its precursor have remained quite tightly targeted on the trade and investment zone. With its particular focus on tariff reduction and trade negotiations, it serves as the pre-eminent glorious knight battling on behalf of consumers.\nHowever, all that began to change in the past two decades. Success attracted allies. The number of WTO members rose from 27 in 1948 to 162 today. Decisions of the WTO remain consensus based, which means that all votes have to be unanimous. Pervasive terror threats, encouraged politicians to focus on the high-intensity and visibility politics of national security and war, as opposed to the low-intensity politics of trade and investment. Progress was also slowed due to shifts in the center of trade gravity and challenges in current markets by rapidly growing new competitors. The global recession intensified the tendency to ignore international economic issues, as attention shifted to domestic job creation and the protection of domestic credit markets. In consequence liberalization has stepped outside of the WTO. The last two decades brought a do-it-yourself approach, defined by mega-regional agreements and preferential pluri-lateral trade negotiations, tailored for only a limited number of players.\nThe Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) are key to this development. TPP is a free trade agreement covering 12 countries from North and South America to the Pacific Rim, while TTIP represents a free trade agreement between the United States and the European Union. The TPP negotiations concluded in October 2015 after four years of intensive talks.

Sardinia, the largest island in the western Mediterranean, sat at an important crossroads in this interconnected world. The indigenous Nuragic culture developed across the island, and these local inhabitants interacted with foreign colonizers and traders, who came to exchange goods and to access Sardinia’s salt, marine resources, obsidian, metals, and rich agricultural lands, among other attractions. Both because of Sardinia’s diverse landscape and central position in ancient social and economic networks in the western Mediterranean, archaeology on the island is uniquely positioned to contribute to ongoing discussions about connectivity, human-environment interaction, and the impact of colonialism on both urban and rural landscapes in the ancient past.\nTo this end, the Sinis Archaeological Project uses multi-scalar regional survey and targeted excavation to explore settlement patterns, landscape use, and colonial interactions in west-central Sardinia, a particularly varied landscape from both environmental and cultural perspectives. Our primary research questions include:\n- How were the diverse landscapes (agricultural plains, mountains, coastal regions, and inland hills) used over the course of the 1st millennium BCE and beyond? Can changing patterns of exploitation and settlement be detected over time? How does contemporary landscape use impact the archaeological remains?\n- To what extent did Phoenician, Punic, and Roman colonial interaction impact each of these landscapes? Were there major differences between colonial interaction in urban and rural environments, or between landscapes with different resources (agricultural vs. mountainous)?\n- How were indigenous Nuragic sites perceived and used by foreign colonizers? What imported material or outside influence can be observed at these sites? By contrast, what material culture shows continuity of local traditions? What local influence can be observed at sites of colonial foundation?\nAnswering these research questions, most immediately, helps us to better understand life in Sardinia in the past, with a primary focus on the period from the 1st millennium BCE through late antiquity.

Modern Uzbeks only came into the picture in the 1500s with the creation of modern day Uzbekistan, which came into being after the dissolution of the Soviet States in the late 1900s.\nThe territory that has come to be known as Uzbekistan has always been at the crossroads of the civilizations of Central Asia and the Middle East. The first inhabitants of Uzbekistan were said to be the Indo-Iranians, who came to the region in 1000 BC. These people d\neveloped irrigation of the rivers of the area and eventually, their settlements grew into the cities now known as some of the oldest continually inhabited cities in the world: Bukhara, formerly known as Bukhoro, Samarkand, or Samarqand, and the capital of modern Uzbekistan, Tashkent, formerly known as Chash.\nBy the 5th century BC, these Uzbek cities, particularly Bukhara and Samarkand, were poised to assume their role in history as centers of trade and commerce, and naturally, crossroads of cultures. It was during this time when the civilizations of China and Europe began trading along a highway that came to be known as the Silk Road. Bukhara and Samarkand, the two major settlements of Transoxania province, became two of the wealthiest and most influential cities on this route through Central Asia. They have been declared UNESCO World Heritage sites for their long history, cultural legacy, and architectural heritage.\nIn 327 BC, the historic regions of Sogdiana and Bactria, both forming parts of modern Uzbekistan, came under the rule of the Macedonian king Alexander the Great. Uzbekistan hence became the northernmost reaches of the Macedonian Empire, which stretched from the Ionian Sea in the Mediterranean to the western portions of the Himalayas.\nAfter Alexander the Great, it was the Persians that ruled these lands, specifically the Parthian and Sassanid empires.

Here is the abstract:\nWestern legal prehistory aims to reconstruct some of the earliest proto-legal and cultural developments that gave rise to Western legal systems and the rule of law. So construed, our understanding of Western legal prehistory is currently highly undeveloped. One reason for this fact is methodological: without the aid of written sources, reconstructions of human prehistory can prove difficult. Recent advances in a broad range of cognate fields have, however, now accumulated past a critical tipping point, and we are now in a secure enough position to begin to reconstruct important aspects of Western legal prehistory.\nThis Article draws upon and develops these contemporary findings to reconstruct the most plausible genealogical shape of Western legal prehistory. In the process, it reaches a somewhat surprising conclusion. On the traditional view, the most important traditions relevant to the rise of Western law and Western Civilization are said to have originated in ancient Greece, Rome, and Israel. This traditional view is, however, based primarily on historical sources, and the reconstructions in this Article suggest that important precursors of these traditions very likely emerged much earlier and much further to the East. In fact, some of the most important traditions relevant to the emergence of large-scale civilizations with the rule of law in the West would appear to represent just one branch a much larger and richer family of traditions, which began to emerge around 4500 BC in the Eastern-Iran-Bactria-Indus-Valley region. Beginning at this early time, this region began to produce one of the very first ancient civilizations to arise within our natural history as a species (viz., the “Harappan” or “Indus Valley” Civilization), and the people in this region must have therefore developed some of the very first cultural traditions that were specifically adapted to sustaining large-scale civilizations with incipient law. I will be arguing that these ancient developments most likely had a much closer and much more intimate relationship to some of the earliest precursors of Western tradition than has commonly been recognized because these precursors of Western tradition ultimately originated closer to ancient Bactria — which is an area directly adjacent to the Indus Valley — during this very same time period.", "score": 0.000401878307546955, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:8c25b54d-e29b-44e5-9c12-45521b2686f0>", "text": "Ann Heirman and Stephan Peter Bumbacher (Boston: Brill, 2007), 49–74, here 57; Elverskog, Buddhism and Islam on the Silk Road, 27; Marylin Martin Rhie, Early Buddhist Art of China and Central Asia, vol. 1: Later Han, Three Kingdoms and Western Chin in China and Bactria to Shan-shan in Central Asia (Boston: Brill, 1999), 22; Tansen Sen, Buddhism, Diplomacy, and Trade: The Realignment of Sino-Indian Relations, 600–1400 (Honolulu: Association for Asian Studies; University of Hawai’i Press, 2003), 3; and E[rik].
