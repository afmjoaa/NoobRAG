No statistic can express the devastation of pain and suffering caused by tobacco. The tobacco industry is however, one of the most profitable businesses in the country; in 1998 tobacco manufacturers’ revenue was $50 billion. Nevertheless, the costs of smoking are far higher than the income from cigarette sales. Tobacco use drains the economy of more than $100 billion dollars in health care costs and lost productivity. This does not include costs associated with diseases caused by environmental tobacco smoke, burn care resulting from cigarette smoking-related fires, or perinatal care for low birth weight infants of mothers who smoke. Health care expenditures caused directly by smoking totaled $50 billion in 1993, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Forty-three percent of these costs were paid by government funds, including Medicaid and Medicare. Tobacco costs Medicare more than $10 billion dollars and Medicaid more than $5 billion dollars per year. A decade ago, lost economic productivity caused by smoking cost the US economy $47.2 billion dollars in 1990, according to the Office of Technology Assessment. Adjusted for inflation, the total economic cost of smoking is more than $100 billion dollars per year at the present time.

Unfortunately, some in Washington are considering cramming changes to Medicare and Social Security into a year-end budget deal. Today, AARP is providing a breakdown of the impact a shortsighted budget deal could have on the health and retirement security of New York seniors and their kids and grandkids.\nSocial Security by-the-numbers in New York and what a last-minute budget deal could mean:\nIn New York State, 2.4 million seniors currently receive Social Security for an average annual benefit of $14,600. Social Security makes up about 58% of the typical older New Yorker's income, lifting 32% out of poverty. In addition, it pumps $45.6 billion into the state economy. Changing the way cost of living adjustments (COLA) are calculated for Social Security beneficiaries by moving to a chained consumer price index, as is on the table in debt deal discussions, cuts benefits, taking roughly $7 billion out of the pockets of New York Social Security beneficiaries over the next 10 years – and $112 billion for beneficiaries nationwide.\n\"The current Social Security COLA already understates what an average older New Yorker spends and purchases each month. Assuming that most people receiving Social Security, who are already just getting by, will simply 'trade down' in their spending on prescription drugs, utilities and other fixed expenses for lower cost options is out of touch with reality,\" said David McNally, Senior Manager of Government Affairs for AARP in New York. \"Americans have worked too hard to earn their benefits to end up getting pushed over the edge in a fiscal cliff deal. Social Security is not a cause of the budget deficit and it shouldn't be used to solve it.\"\nMedicare by-the-numbers in New York and what a last-minute budget deal could mean:\nRoughly 2.5 million New Yorkers are enrolled in Medicare, spending 12%, or $3,500 on out-of-pocket medical expenses.", "score": 0.84655422, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:d992f0ce-6e20-4b29-a33e-940f577785dd>", "text": "The American Lung Association believes the tax revenue in Illinois will decrease because of the reduced consumption of tobacco products.

They must pay the surcharge if they or a covered dependent smokes.\nTwelve states make state employees who smoke pay such a surcharge, reported the Wisconsin State Journal recently. Wisconsin is considering imposing a fee of $50 per month.\nJune Deen, state director of the American Lung Association in Georgia, said Monday that surcharges generally have not been proved as effective as offering benefits that help employees stop smoking.\nThe State Health Benefit Plan has added benefits such as phone and online counseling for smokers and covers several medications to help them quit, she noted.\nThe plan’s members, if they join the state’s cessation telephone coaching program, can get either prescription or over-the-counter medication to help them quit their habit. And eventually they can get the surcharge removed.\n“The average smoker quits several times before quitting for good,’’ Deen said.\nThe state’s surcharge may have led some people to quit, she said. “We’re happy to see reductions in smoking,’’ she added.\nUse of employee tobacco surcharges is rising among employers in general. A 2012 national health benefits survey by Mercer found 19 percent of large employers vary the employee contribution amount based on tobacco use, or provide other incentives to encourage workers not to use tobacco. That’s up from 17 percent in 2011.\nRoughly one in five Georgia adults smoke, which is also roughly the national average.

AP-NY-10-08-97 1928EDT\nMidrange estimates based upon likely assumptions suggest net external costs from smoking in the range of 33 cents per pack in 1995 prices, an amount that by itself is too small to justify either current cigarette taxes or the proposed tax increase.\nFinally, the following comes from Jacob Sullum, the author of \"For Your Own Good\"\nAs the U.S. Office of Technology Assessment noted in 1993: \"Reduction or elimination of smoking would improve health and extend longevity, but may not lead to savings in health care costs. In fact, significant reductions in smoking prevalence and the attendant increase in life expectancy could lead to future increases in total medical spending, in Medicare program outlays, and in the budgets of Social Security and other government programs.\"\nIn his 1994 analysis of the issue, the economist W. Kip Viscusi found that \"on balance there is a net cost savings to society even excluding consideration of the current cigarette taxes paid by smokers.\" Based on these calculations, he noted, one could argue that \"cigarette smoking should be subsidized rather than taxed.\"\nNOTE: All of the above calculations are purely economic. The “moral” costs of people smoking and dying younger are not factored in. The question for legislators though is whether “moral” costs are an appropriate basis for taxation, and if they are, then who should be empowered to define that morality? On a purely economic basis smokers seem to be paying far more in dollars than their fair share given what they eventually “cost” society in terms of those dollars.

First, unlike traditional mortgages, it can actually cost more to process an HECM loan and require that people pay out more closing costs and processing fees than for what they may have been initially prepared. If they do not have the cash on hand right now to pay these fees, it could be advisable that they wait until they save that money. In many cases, the loan cannot be processed until those fees are paid up front.\nHowever, aside from higher than average processing and closing fees, the financial implications from a reverse mortgage tend to be overwhelmingly positive. People who live on Social Security or SSDI are often held to tight standards when it comes to bringing more money into their household budgets. They often cannot work a part-time job or receive any other source of income without being penalized heavily by the Social Security Administration. When they take out a reverse mortgage, borrowers often do not have to report this money as income. The money is considered to be a loan, even if borrowers use it to bulk up their bank accounts or supplement their Social Security payments. They can receive this cash without being penalized by the government.\nLikewise, borrowers who rely on Medicare also can receive one of these loans without fear of losing their health coverage. Many times, people who work part-time jobs or receive money from other source have to report the money as income and risk losing some or all of their Medicare coverage. With one of these mortgages, many Medicare recipients escape having experiencing any negative consequences, but instead can use the money for their intended purposes while still retaining their health coverage.\nAlong with avoiding negative implications on their Social Security or Medicare privileges, people also do not have to claim this money on their income tax returns. When they file taxes for the tax year in which they received their reverse mortgage, seniors are not required to claim the funds from the loan as a source of income. As with Social Security and Medicare, the IRS counts this cash as a loan and thus makes no claim to it when people file their returns. These financial advantages let people use the money without fear of having to pay expensive penalties or taxes on it later.\nMoreover, people who apply for one of these mortgages also can rest assured that they will never owe more than the appraisal value of their home.", "score": 0.008358313097358286, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:d1a5e88c-6936-4f02-b777-c91b289b78f4>", "text": "DISCOVER HOW A REVERSE MORTGAGE WILL HELP YOU INCREASE YOUR CASH FLOW, REDUCE EXPENDITURES AND ADD MONEY TO YOUR SAVINGS\nA reverse mortgage can be a financial game changer for those over 62.

The report of the Social Security Trustees should be an eye-opener:\nAs we reported last year, Medicare’s financial difficulties come sooner—and are much more severe—than those confronting Social Security. While both programs face demographic challenges, rapidly growing health care costs also affect Medicare. Underlying health care costs per enrollee are projected to rise faster than the earnings per worker on which payroll taxes and Social Security benefits are based. As a result, while Medicare’s annual costs were 3.2 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2008, or about three quarters of Social Security’s, they are projected to surpass Social Security expenditures in 2028 and reach 11.4 percent of GDP in 2083.\nThe projected 75-year actuarial deficit in the Hospital Insurance (HI) Trust Fund is now 3.88 percent of taxable payroll, up from 3.54 percent projected in last year’s report. The fund again fails our test of short-range financial adequacy, as projected annual assets drop below projected annual expenditures within 10 years—by 2012. The fund also continues to fail our long range test of close actuarial balance by a wide margin. The projected date of HI Trust Fund exhaustion is 2017, two years earlier than in last year’s report, when dedicated revenues would be sufficient to pay 81 percent of HI costs. Projected HI dedicated revenues fall short of outlays by rapidly increasing margins in all future years. The Medicare Report shows that the HI Trust Fund could be brought into actuarial balance over the next 75 years by changes equivalent to an immediate 134 percent increase in the payroll tax (from a rate of 2.9 percent to 6.78 percent), or an immediate 53 percent reduction in program outlays, or some combination of the two. Larger changes would be required to make the program solvent beyond the 75-year horizon.\nThe projected exhaustion of the HI Trust Fund within the next eight years is an urgent concern. Congressional action will be necessary to ensure uninterrupted provision of HI services to beneficiaries.

Others start their social security and pensions if available, and whatever shortfall which might exist, those funds are pulled from their personal investments. This may work for some individuals, but others may find they have run out of funds long before they have run out of life.\nThose retiring must do two things. First, they should determine how much disposable income is needed to cover their living expenses, financial surprises, planned purchases, and income taxes. Some may refer to a rule-of-thumb of sixty or eighty percent of their gross salary at the time of retirement. This may be a starting place, but the final number may be significantly different. Many employers offer a variety of deductions in addition to the mandatory tax deductions. Thus a close examination of the paycheck would be in order. The deduction will range from 7.65% for Social Security and Medicare, to as much as thirty percent or more for other expenditures that will not continue into retirement. There may also be monthly expenses paid that will change, such as costs for business attire, parking, and transportation to name a few. Additionally, there may be new expenses such as hobbies or increased travel costs due to new found time during retirement.\nOnce the income amount is known, then a calculation of the fixed income that will be received is the second step. When the amount of social security, pension income, and any other fixed sources are known, then the amount of reliance upon personal investment assets that will exist can be determined. If funds will be need to be pulled from personal holdings, it is wise to determine the withdrawal rate. This is the expected annual amount withdrawn divided by the value of the accounts available to produce the income. In today’s low interest rate environment, a high withdrawal rate can be an indicator to future troubles. There is no set rule, but I personally prefer to see withdrawal rates less than seven percent.\nIf the withdrawal rate is below seven percent, that does not exempt the investor from future trouble. If the assets are invested very conservatively and are only generating two percent income, then the current withdrawals could be depleting the account unless the investments are changed or the annual withdrawals are reduced. It is our opinion the investments should be allocated in a manner that will over time produce income and increased value at a rate greater than the withdrawal rate.", "score": 0.003012025042430719, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:90a51ca9-b7de-47d7-9998-a37d2d016736>", "text": "These are just a few samples of the tendencies and differences which make the people such a widely diverse collection, with different histories and backgrounds, so giving the group the need for a larger assortment of treatment plans and replies. \nAdditionally, boomers are more likely to possess double diagnosis, together with untreated long standing co-morbid mentalhealth difficulties, such as ADHD, anxiety disorder, as well as different personality disorders, that have been simply not recognized by the health care community back at the day once the boomers were younger.\nIn the end, the aging mistreated human anatomy in retirement will require more medical attention, more care-giving, more nursing homes, more medications, and also much more money, typically, than a person that has led a relatively healthy existence span.\nMacroeconomics: Medicare and Social Security Programs\nThe higher monetary and societal costs associated with older adult treatment, recovery, and clinical service can be substantial.

This time around, the Social Security Administration projects that the system will become bankrupt in the year 2031. Yet, the financial implications of this bankruptcy will confront taxpayers 16 year s sooner, in the year 2015.\nThe historical and projected growth path of expenditures and tax collections are expressed as a percentage of taxable payroll. The tax collections consist of dedicated payroll taxes and, since 1985, the revenue dedicated to the Social Security Trust Fund derived from the income taxation of Social Security benefits. A major mismatch between Social Security expenditures and tax collections confronts U.S. taxpayers and Social Security recipients.\nHowever, the pending insolvency of the Social Security system is only one-half of the story. The other half is that most future retirees can expect to lose money on Social Security when it is evaluated as an investment program for retirement.\nConsequently, the challenge – and urgency- of reforming Social Security is not simply to restore solvency to the system, because any reforms (like payroll tax increases) undertaken with solvency as the sole goal will make Social Security an even worse retirement program for future retirees. The challenge is to devise a reform program that simultaneously honors the promises made to current (and near-term) retirees and offers today’s working population a better financial future.", "score": 0.0027555487997363137, "source": "sparse"}]}

Is it possible the males mistake the bearded ladies for fellow males? Or are bearded ladies somehow less fit and, therefore, less attractive to males?\"\nTo answer this last question, the team members studied the differences between the reproductive output of bearded ladies and the less-common females without male-pattern coloring. They found that, compared to their more-feminine counterparts, bearded ladies laid clutches that weighed less. In addition, they laid their eggs about 13 days later in the mating season.\n\"The lower mass may indicate that the eggs have smaller yolks and so the embryos don't have as many available nutrients,\" Langkilde said. \"As for the timing, the 13-day difference is significant. It means that the bearded ladies' offspring hatch later, so they have less time to gather food and to prepare for overwinter hibernation, which is a tough period that few babies survive. As a result, females with less blue coloration may have an evolutionary advantage with regard to the fitness of their offspring. This might explain why males tend to prefer them.\"\nLangkilde and Swierk hypothesize that, although bearded ladies currently are more common in many fence-lizard populations, the evolutionary tide might be turning.", "score": 0.832377136, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:ed582d9f-b31e-4c74-9126-bf00fbb32e1c>", "text": "While some are carnivorous in nature, thriving mainly on birds, mammals and other reptiles, the vegetarians prefer leaves, vegetables, flowers or fruits. There are mainly two venomous lizards, the Gila monster as well as Mexican beaded Lizard. The saliva glands present within the jaws generate the venom. The lizards chew the venom into the victim. The caiman lizards prefer snails or other shelled animals. Once it catches the shelled animals, it moves up the head and releases the grip, so that the snail can roll towards the back of its mouth. Then it bites and cracks the shell with the help of flat molar-like teeth, and bites and rotates the snail alternatively with its tongue, and gets rid of the broken shell pieces.\nUsually lizards prefer crickets, grasshoppers, flies and other insects which they catch with their elongated sticky tongues. Under domestication, lizards eat worms and meat along with insects, and also feed on vegetables or fruits on the basis of the preferences of the lizard specie.\nThere are numerous processes for the male lizards to arrest the attention of the female lizards. They might oscillate their head up and down rapidly, or showcase the bright colors in the body or any other interesting feature they possess. The green anole can swell a rust colored throat sack and display this for several hours in order to win the lady lizard. The brown colored African lizard changes his head color in fiery red and his body and tail into bright blue color for attracting the females. At times, the male lizards compete with each other, till they eliminate the weaker one.\nBreeding and Hatchlings\nLizards Hatching from Eggs\nThe eggs laid by the females are tender and leathery in nature. The lizards never guard the eggs or keep them warm. Instead, the young hatchlings can protect themselves without any help from the mother. Nevertheless, all the eggs are not soft and some of the mothers to take care of the little ones.\nThe Tokay gecko tends to lay exceptional eggs, which will eventually become hard when exposed to dry air, and adheres to the surfaces where it they laid them.

When expanded, the frill makes this lizard look much larger than it actually is. Read on to learn about the frilled lizard.\nDescription of the Frilled Lizard\nThese lizards are relatively long, though not quite as large as some of the other Australian reptiles. They grow a little over three feet long at their largest, and usually only weigh a pound or two.\nTheir scales are a grayish-brown color, to better match bark, sand, and other similar surfaces.

None other than the frilled lizard of course!\n- Large and in Charge – When predators decide to make a meal out of this lizard, they meet a much larger looking creature than they anticipated. This is because, when fully extended, the frilled lizard’s frill is about a foot across.\n- Spooking Skills – If the large frill isn’t enough, this reptile has a few other tricks up its sleeve. They also open their mouths, hiss ferociously, and rear up on their hind legs. From this position they even charge at their attacker while walking on their rear legs!\n- Tree Dweller – In most videos of this animal, you see it dashing around on the ground with its frill open.

However, the ability to change color and camouflaging enables them to hide by remaining still for several hours. When in danger, some of the lizards shed a part of their tail that is weak and easily detachable. This helps them for a narrow escape, and it gradually grows back after some time, even though it will not look exactly same, but it saves them from dying.\nDifferent species of lizards have different strategies of getting rid of the enemies. The horned lizards squirt blood to scare away the enemies. They have small blood vessels present in the eyes for this purpose. The sungazer lizard bears sharp spikes covering the entire body. The armadillo has pointed scales and they even have the ability to roll the entire body into a tight ball like structure for shielding the soft belly. The alligator lizards on the other hand, bite, beat or eject foul smell for scaring the enemies. The tropical Chuckwallas hides inside a crack, and bloats its body so that predators cannot extract it out of the cavities.\nThe shingle-backed skink (for T. Rugosa Asper, the only eastern Australian subspecies) possesses a thick, bulky tail, which is similar to its head. Thus, as soon as it detects danger, it bends the whole body in a U like shape, which can frighten the predator, as it seems that it has two heads.\nThe Frilled lizard, residing in Australia has its entire neck covered with a layer of loose skin or frill, which swells up as soon as becomes tense or if something scares it. Thus, it appears to be comparatively bigger in size than the actual size, and uses this to advantage to scare the predator by giving an impression that it is really bigger than it actually is; the predator may decide to look for a smaller prey. In case this strategy fails, then it uses its hind feet to scoot.\nChameleon Catches Cricket\nThe food habits of the lizards depend largely on its nature.", "score": 0.822711468, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:0c06d74a-7476-4c2c-9e77-e6a3ddb97c59>", "text": "Lizard Reproductive System\n|This article has been peer reviewed but is awaiting expert review.

Like chameleons, Changeable Lizards can move each of their eyes in different directions.\nChangeable Lizards eat mainly insects and small vertebrates, including rodents and other lizards. Although they have teeth, these are designed for gripping prey and not tearing it up. So prey is swallowed whole, after it is stunned by shaking it about. Sometimes, young inexperienced Changeable Lizards may choke on prey which are too large. Occasionally changeable lizards also consume vegetable matter.

Tokay Geckoes have a hearing range from about 300 Hertz to 10,000 Hertz.\nThey have soft, granular skin that feels velvety to the touch.

Here’s why: the skinks living in the warm coastal lowlands of Australia are oviparous (they lay eggs). But members of the same species have begun opting for live births (no eggs, directly giving birth to babies) further up in the cooler climates of the mountains. So does the yellow-bellied three-toed skink lay eggs or give birth to live babies? Both … for now!\nAnd THAT is what is exciting.\nWhat's special about this?\nOver time, several species of reptiles have made the transition from egg-laying to live births.

If you were a herpetologist (someone who studies reptiles), this would be a chance of a lifetime.\nHow does the skink do that?\nScientists know that the process of giving birth in mammals is highly advanced. Food and oxygen for the developing baby comes through a sac called the placenta. Correspondingly, when a reptile lays eggs on the ground, the nourishment for the unborn baby comes from the yolk and much needed calcium comes from the porous eggshell.\nIf a reptile is moving from laying eggs to live births, what might be happening to make sure that the baby gets its nourishment? The scientists decided to check what was happening in the yellow-bellied three-toed skink that lived in the cool mountains.\nWell, it turned out to be a rather smooth transition! The mother’s womb seemed to secrete calcium that got absorbed into the embryo. Scientists believe that this is the beginning of placenta-formation in reptiles. The ease of the switch is likely why there have been so many instances in history of species making the change from egg-laying to live births.\nThis research was published in the Journal of Morphology in August 2010 by James Stewart from East Tennessee State University and co-authors.\nWhich reptile fascinates you the most and why?", "score": 0.819955111, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:b13c64e8-16fd-46d8-8b25-eed81d2f221e>", "text": "Lizards are reptiles of the order Squamata, normally possessing four legs, external ear openings and movable eyelids.

They are distant cousins to the Bearded Dragon but share very few similarities. Frilled Dragons like being up high in the trees rather than on the ground. The New Guinea Frilled Dragon is the most commonly sold Frilled Dragon. They are grey in color with yellowish tints in their frills but can also have red coloration. Australian Frilled Dragons are larger and can come in grey or reddish orange on their bodies and red in their frill. They also have distinctive white cheeks and are hard to find and very expensive to buy. Occasionally you will come across hybrids of the two or intergrades of the different Australian localities.\nSince Frilled dragons like being in the trees, you will want a tall enclosure. Babies should be housed in 29 gallon tanks or larger. Adults should be housed in nothing smaller than 4′ H x 3′ L x 2′ D. Solid enclosures are recommended although as long as you can maintain proper humidity and temperatures, screen/mesh can be used.\nEnclosures should be furnished with plenty of live or fake plants. There should be a variety of vertical basking areas as well. Housing multiple dragons is possible although not always recommended. Females can sometimes be housed together but never 2 males. A male/female pair is possible but they have to be unrelated and you have to make sure that the two are not constantly breeding or breeding too young. When you house multiple dragons you will need an enclosure that is double the size generally used for a single dragon. You also face risks of the dragons becoming territorial and fighting for dominance (regardless of gender) which could lead to injuries or death. As mentioned before, you can have a pair over-breed or breed too young which may shorten life expectancy. Housing multiple dragons together also increases the risk of cross contamination which could result in you having to pay 2 vet bills instead of just 1 had they each had their own enclosure.\nAs with any reptile, substrate is always a topic of debate. With Frilled Dragons it is a little easier to choose however. They spend majority of their time up high and rarely go to the ground other than to eat.

Halford, A. J. Cheal, D. Ryan, D. M. Williams|\n|Abstract||Recognition of the complex spatial and temporal variability of abundance and diversity found in many populations has led to a greater focus on the roles of heterogeneity, stochasticity, and disturbance in the structure and persistence of communities. This focus is directly relevant to coral reef communities that are characterized by very high species diversity in a spatially heterogeneous environment, display stochastic variability in community structure at small spatial and temporal scales, and are subject to major disturbances. We monitored coral and fish assemblages over 14 years on fixed sites spread over 80 km of the southern Great Barrier Reef (GBR), Australia, and found evidence of large-scale resilience and predictable recovery of these assemblages. Sometime between November 1987 and October 1989, live coral cover on the shallow northeast flanks of some reefs in the southern GBR decreased from >80% to <10%, probably as a result of storm damage. We compared the fish and benthic communities present in these areas prior to the disturbance (1983-1984) with those present in 1992 and the subsequent changes through to 1998. Hard coral cover increased slowly from 1992 to 1994, then accelerated to be indistinguishable from pre-impact levels by 1998. The response of the coral assemblages was largely due to the predominance of tabulate Acropora species and their characteristics of rapid growth and competitive dominance. Patterns of species richness of the fish families Acanthuridae, Chaetodontidae, Scaridae, and Pomacentridae mirrored that of hard coral, except the Pomacentridae had not recovered to pre-impact levels by 1998. Of the 26 fish species analyzed for changes in abundance, 88% decreased after the disturbance, then subsequently increased, with all but two recovering to pre-impact levels by 1998. Although processes such as settlement and immigration are ultimately responsible for replenishment of local populations, our data suggested that habitat plays a strong role in modifying fish assemblages.", "score": 0.87888813, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:478bd1f1-db78-4bcb-8857-6bf3d3fab5c9>", "text": "Climate Variability & Marine Fisheries\nHow Does Climate Variability Affect Fish Populations?\nMarine ecosystems are not in a steady state, but are affected by the environment, which varies on many spatial and temporal scales. Fish populations respond to the variation in different ways. As examples, during short term weather changes such as storms, fish may take refuge from rough conditions through minor changes in distribution. Interannual or El Niño scale changes in the ocean environment may result in changes in the distribution patterns of migratory fishes and can affect reproduction and recruitment in other species. Decadal and longer scale variations may have other impacts, potentially including cyclic changes in the production level of marine ecosystems in ways that may favor one species or group over another. Scientists at the Pacific Fisheries Environmental Laboratory and their collaborators strive to understand how these mechanisms work and to incorporate this knowledge into the management and conservation of the nation's living marine resources.\nTemperature is one way we measure ocean variability, but temperature is also an indicator of more complex ocean processes. Changes in temperature are related to alterations in oceanic circulation patterns that are affected by changes in the direction and speed of the winds that drive ocean currents and mix surface waters with deeper nutrient rich waters. These processes in turn affect the abundance and variety of plankton which are food for small fish. The biological responses to those ocean processes are complex and not well understood.\nMost fish species have a fairly narrow range of optimum temperatures related both to the species basic metabolism and the availability of food organisms that have their own optimum temperature ranges. Depending on the species, the area it occupies may expand, shrink or be relocated with changes in ocean conditions. Some small pelagic fish, such as sardine and whiting, migrate seasonally between southern California breeding grounds and southern British Columbia feeding grounds and the length of these migrations is affected by climatic variations. Some resident fish such as rockfish do not make alongshore migrations but they may move into deeper cooler water during periods of warm water. El Niño and other longterm climatic variations have marked affects on both resident and migratory fishes.\nLong-term records of the abundance for most species are limited to historical commercial and recreational landings. These records are often influenced by economic factors such as the relative price paid for different types of fish, and changes in fishing methods or fishing effort. These non-climatic factors often obscure climate related trends in fish abundance.", "score": 0.875469327, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:2dd5e3da-037e-45ed-b566-75faea293672>", "text": "My research aims to understand how the behaviour of reef fish influences the resilience of coral reefs to environmental change.

Temporal changes in fish community structure were examined in an intensive two-year study of the reef fishes of Hanalei Bay, Kauai, Hawaii. Hanalei Bay is directly exposed to winter swells with high surf, as well as frequent heavy winter rainfall and high river discharge. Twenty-two transects (25 x 5 m) were established in a wide variety of habitats and censused monthly (N = 1052 censuses). Over 121 000 sightings of individuals from 150 species were made during the study. Seasonal patterns in number of species, number of individuals, species diversity, and evenness were observed, with winter values usually lowest. Values of these ensemble variables tended to be higher at deeper sites and at sites with greater habitat complexity. Surf height and degree of wave exposure were negatively correlated with several measures of community organization. Groups of fishes with different levels of spatial mobility tended to occupy depths consistent with their various abilities to respond to events of heavy weather. The rank abundance of fish taxa tended to be more stable seasonally at sites with less exposure to high wave energy.

On tropical reefs, coral bleaching, degradation of habitat and declining adult stocks are also likely to change contemporary patterns of dispersal and gene flow and may lead to range contractions or expansions. On the Great Barrier Reef, where adjacent reefs form a highly interconnected system, we use allozyme surveys of c. 3000 coral colonies to show that populations are genetically diverse, and rates of gene flow for a suite of five species range from modest to high among reefs up to 1200 km apart. In contrast, 700 km further south on Lord Howe Island, genetic diversity is markedly lower and populations are genetically isolated. The virtual absence of long-distance dispersal of corals to geographically isolated, oceanic reefs renders them extremely vulnerable to global warming, even where local threats are minimal.\n|Item Type:||Article (Refereed Research - C1)|\n|Keywords:||climate change; coral reefs; gene flow; genotypic diversity; marine protected areas; asexual reproduction; broadcast spawning; brooding; clonality; dispersal; global warming; scleratinian corals|\n|Date Deposited:||18 Jan 2010 05:01|\n|FoR Codes:||06 BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES > 0699 Other Biological Sciences > 069999 Biological Sciences not elsewhere classified @ 100%|\n|SEO Codes:||96 ENVIRONMENT > 9605 Ecosystem Assessment and Management > 960508 Ecosystem Assessment and Management of Mining Environments @ 100%|\n|Citation Count from Web of Science||", "score": 0.862049758, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:0146be09-3b7c-4108-b7b0-963177311179>", "text": "You are not currently logged in.\nAccess JSTOR through your library or other institution:\nEcologically Relevant Dispersal of Corals on Isolated Reefs: Implications for Managing Resilience\nJim N.

However, the effective design of reserves must account for the spatial scales of larval dispersal that affect the demography of communities over ecological time frames. Ecologically relevant distances of dispersal were inferred from DNA microsatellite data in a broadcast-spawning (Acropora tenuis) and a brooding (Seriatopora hystrix) coral at isolated reef systems off northwest Australia. Congruent with expectations based on life histories, levels of genetic subdivision among populations were markedly higher in the brooder than in the broadcast spawner. Additionally, significant subdivision for both species between systems (>100 km), and between (>10 km) or within reefs (<10 km) within systems, indicated that many reefs or reef patches are demographically independent. There was also a clear distinction in the scale of genetic structure between the different systems; at the more geographically complex of the systems, a much finer scale structure was detected in both species. This suggested that the hydrodynamics associated with these complex reefs restrict distances regularly traveled by larvae. The primary implication is that short-term recovery of these coral communities after severe disturbance requires the input of larvae from viable communities kilometers to a few tens of kilometers away. Therefore, to be self-sustaining, we suggest that coral reef protected areas need to be large enough to encompass these routine dispersal distances. Further, to facilitate recovery from severe disturbances, protected areas need to be replicated over these spatial scales. However, specific designs also need to account for size, complexity, and isolation of reefs, which will either restrict or enhance dispersal within this range.\nEcological Applications © 2009 Wiley", "score": 0.861578107, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:9349cff9-58d4-46ae-9a84-3c4daf80dcd9>", "text": "The loss of genetic variation in traits could be offset by increased expression of environmental variation in the phenotype. Alternatively, fluctuations in the direction of selection, quite possible in marginal populations exposed to changes in population densities , could increase phenotypic variation . As a result, it remains unclear exactly how the extent of phenotypic variation should evolve at range margins.\nIrrespective of the exact processes contributing to this result, we have demonstrated that geographical marginality can be associated with substantial change in P. More work, both theoretical and empirical, is needed to assess the generality of this result in other taxa, and if it proves to be a common pattern, its causes and consequences for evolutionary rates and directions. In the meantime, it appears likely that for reef fishes at least, differences in P, and possibly G, can result from conditions encountered by wild populations living close to their range edges. As patterns of phenotypic variation can have a substantial influence over a population’s evolutionary trajectory [18, 54], such differences in phenotypic covariance are likely to have important consequences for evolution at range margins.\nGiven contemporary threats posed by climate change, invasive species, and landscape fragmentation, understanding the forces shaping species’ ranges is of critical importance to the long-term conservation of biodiversity. Attempts to predict future range migrations, or the longer-term persistence of populations in new locations, or with changing environmental conditions, while ignoring changes in phenotypic covariance at range edges may seriously undermine our predictions of the abilities of species to adapt, and thereby, our estimates of extinction risk. Acquiring a greater understanding of evolutionary potential in marginal populations should be accorded very high priority by evolutionary and conservation biologists alike.\nPhenotypic covariation was greater between populations of reef fishes at both northern (warm) and southern (cool) range margins compared to populations closer to their range centers. Given the variety of life histories and morphologies represented by these species, and differences in environmental conditions experienced by these edge populations, the changes in P between central and marginal populations appear to be independent of these proximate factors, and are more likely the consequence of evolutionary processes operating in marginal populations. Neither the degree of morphological integration of the traits studied, nor the ranks of P, indicated greater evolutionary constraint at range edges. Instead, these differences in P may reflect structural change in P caused by selection or drift, and the potential to evolve in the future.", "score": 0.861450374, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:342d3e7c-38e9-4522-9201-d49fd4c8f767>", "text": "As a fish physiologist, I am interested in understanding how anthropogenic stressors, such as climate change and capture, affect coastal fishes.

Meaningful, consistent, comparable, and quantitative data are required to quantify the changes that result from restoration actions.\nWhy We Care\nCoral reefs provide many key ecosystem services, including coastal protection, habitat for diverse organisms, and support to human uses such as tourism and fisheries. As coral reefs continue to decline due to both global and local stressors, there is an increasing focus on coral reef restoration to help preserve coral reef ecosystems. Restoration can be used to meet many different goals to enhance natural coral populations and improve the services that reefs provide. Restoration goals can include improving coral reefs’ ecological resilience, climate resilience, and the coastal protection that reefs provide; promoting marine education, stewardship and tourism; provisioning of livelihoods; and improving fish and invertebrate abundance through enhanced habitat. Coral reef restoration, while a quickly growing field, is still relatively new. Guidance on how best to evaluate the success of coral restoration for multiple goals is needed, as is spatial planning for restoration implementation.\nWhat We Are Doing\nNCCOS is working to develop scientific guidance for restoration design, implementation, and monitoring for successful coral restoration. Some related products include the “Coral Reef Restoration Monitoring Guide: methods to evaluate restoration success from local to ecosystem scales” and “Coral restoration for coastal resilience: a framework for multi-scale integration of ecology, hydrodynamics, and engineering.” In addition, we work to apply emerging technology to restoration design and implementation and to make this accessible to users. One example is a webinar on “Photomosaics as a Tool for Monitoring Coral Restoration Success.”\nNCCOS is also contributing to spatial planning for restoration siting. We use a geospatial approach that includes spatial data management and visualization (e.g., Dashboards), habitat mapping, and application of predictive species models.\nWe work with multiple partners who represent managers, restoration practitioners, and scientists to create a collaborative community. These include the Coral Restoration Consortium, the NOAA Restoration Center, the Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary, and many others.\nBenefits of Our Work\nThis work provides a scientific framework for designing and implementing coral restoration and for evaluating the success of restoration.

What we uncovered is that fishing has long-lasting seascape impacts, even when fishing has stopped in parks for decades,” said Dr. Tim McClanahan, WCS Senior Conservationist and lead author of the study.\nThe researchers gathered data from a number of reef fish studies conducted between 2005 and 2016 on nearly 1,000 coral reefs to evaluate the effectiveness of remote reef baselines and nearshore benchmarks, management or access systems that are often used to evaluate the ecological status of marine ecosystems.\nThe coral reefs examined included both fishing closures (ranging from more than 15 years to 48 years in duration) and reef systems in sites that were more than 9 hours travel time from land-based markets. The mean distance to markets for remote areas was 39 hours of travel time compared to 2 hours for nearshore fisheries closures. Fish species from 28 families commonly found in coral reefs were included in the analysis. Sharks, generally wide-ranging species that are not always effectively protected through fishing closures, were excluded from the analysis. Thus, the finding could not be attributed to losses of sharks, species known to be highly vulnerable to fishing.\nThe analysis found that there was no significant change in a reef’s biomass between those fish communities found in fishing closures that were approximately 15 years old and those that were nearly 50 years old. They did find that fishing closures had only 40 percent of the fish biomass contained in more remote reefs that had not experienced significant levels of fishing.

A reduction in habitat complexity will result in less hiding places for small fishes and ultimately in a decline of fish biomass affecting not only the socio-economic important reef-fish fishery but also the resilience of reefs to disturbances.

When assessing risk we are trying to determine the likelihood of harm occurring, which requires a failed containment mechanism, a leakage pathway, and a specific hazard form.\nGeologic Storage and Storage Mechanisms To begin the discussion of GS risk, we first need to understand the general characteristics\nof GS operations. In a GS operation compressed carbon dioxide is captured from an emissions source and injected into a subsurface geologic rock layer. Subsurface pressures increase with depth and suitable rock formations are usually at least 800m so that the CO2 can be injected at supercritical (dense fluid) pressures. While an appropriate injection formation will be porous and have sufficient space to accept the CO2, it also must have an overlying layer of impermeable rock so that the CO2 will stay trapped within the storage reservoir. Before injection the reservoir pore space is generally filled with a brine water solution, but this solution is partially displaced by the injected supercritical CO2. The reservoir’s CO2 storage capacity depends on a number of factors, and operators need to avoid over-pressurization which can damage the reservoir. The CO2 is more buoyant than the in-situ fluids and rises within the formation. The design goal of GS is avoid the emission of CO2 and keep the CO2 isolated from the atmosphere for long time scales. The GS reservoir’s ability to store the CO2 relies on four mechanisms: structural and\nstratigraphic trapping, residual gas trapping, solubility trapping, and mineral trapping (See Figure 3-3) (Metz et al., 2005). Additionally, the subsurface in situ pressure serves to limit fluid escape, rock deformation, and seismic events.", "score": 0.806830049, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:6c300ffe-a999-44ff-9568-36544ce42f2d>", "text": "The upper Paleozoic beds in Erdos Basin form good reservoir cap assemblage because inheritance river delta sedimentary system develop, sand body distribute widely, multi-layer sand overlap, sand and coal source rock interbed and are closely adjacent.\nTight sand gas resvoir in upper Triassic series formation Xujiahe section in Sichuan Basin show that sand and source rock are closely adjacent, source-reservoir-cap looks like a sandwich.

Historically in order to accomplish the task of expanding this system of accumulation, this small percentage has drawn up groups amongst subservient classes into alliances based on national oppression and gender oppression. In reality, there is no capitalism, which is necessarily expansive, without imperialism. Likewise, there is no imperialism, which is defined as the bourgeoisie of one nation engaged in the exploitation of other nations, without national oppression. To wit, there is no national oppression, imperialism, or capitalism in which women, who dominate both the global productive workforce and are often coerced into unpaid domestic labor, don’t suffered the most. Going even further, there is no such as the aforementioned system which isn’t reliant on exhausting ecological and natural resources. In this light, the ‘interconnectedness’ between these different forms of oppression, all centering around a process of production and accumulation and the capitalist-imperialist system which embodies it, are clear.\nFrom the perspective of a Marxist approach, hooks’ use of the words oppression and exploitation are clunky and misapplied. While hooks defines the word oppression in relation to exploitation and discrimination early in Feminist Theory, these definitions seem acquired from the perspectives she is attempting to expand beyond:\n“Being oppressed means absence of choices. It is the primary point of contact between the oppressed and the oppressor. Many women in this society do have choices (as inadequate as they are); therefore exploitation and discrimination are words that more accurately describe the lot of women collectively in the United States. [sic]” (p. 5)\nMuch later in the book, in the context of critiquing the ways in which “feminist consciousness-raising has not pushed women in the direction of revolutionary politics” nor “helped women understand capitalism,” she correctly explains that First World women (in hooks’ words, “we”) “benefit from the exploitation and oppression of women and men globally…” (p. 161)\nExploitation, which hooks leaves undefined, and oppression, which ‘absence of choices’ describes in the most apolitical manner, are crucially related.\nExploitation is best understood not by the liberal definition of ‘using another for selfish purposes.’ Rather, exploitation relates directly to the process of production and accumulation.

Whether it's your personality, abilities, or physical looks we're all very unique. These differences are the results of our genetic makeup. One interesting subject in the area of genetics is somatypes.\nSomatype is another term for body type. Most people have a genetic predisposition toward one specific somatype and supportive traits from a second kind. In the 1940's scientists introduced the theory of body types. Their ideas described three basic human body types: the endomorph, characterized by an excess of body fat; the mesomorph, marked by a well-developed musculature; and the ectomorph, distinguished by a lack of either much fat or muscle tissue. They did also state that most people were a mixture of these. These three categories of morphology are used to predict how certain people will react to certain portions of macronutrients, thus enabling health professionals to determine correct diets and exercise regimens for their clients. The three somatypes are widely known in sports such as bodybuilding, and in the applied health fields involving nutrition and weight management.\nSomatypes are looked at most often in sports for different types of athletes. An athlete cannot change what their body type is; all they can do is use nutrition to their advantage and play a sport that fits them as an individual.\nA classic ectomorph is typically a person who is naturally thin. These individuals usually have a low body fat percentage, small bone size, a high metabolism, and a small amount of muscle mass and muscle size. These factors all compliment one another to produce a thin, wiry, nervous type of person or athlete. The bones are light in weight, joints are smaller than normal and muscles are underdeveloped. The limbs are relatively long in proportion and the shoulders tend to droop down.\nThe ectomorph has a linear physique as they may appear to be straight up and down, and may appear longer than he or she really is, due to the length of limbs coupled with lack of muscle mass developed on those limbs.\nThe ectomorph does not have natural athletic power and each ounce of muscle they strive for will take extra effort. It is common to find ectomorphs in sports like cycling, cross country running, and other endurance sports.", "score": 0.802459896, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:bef5c55e-185d-4e01-a2f1-87a410642c53>", "text": "Types of Data and Their Characteristics\n|Type and Characteristic||Typical Applications||Scale Characteristics Possessed|\n|Nominal — identification or classification||\n|Ordinal — specifies order or rank||\nAgreement (Likert scales)\n|Interval — specifies order based on equidistant intervals (implies equal increments of measurement)||\nIQ, test scores\nDegree in F° and C°\nTime of day\n|Ratio — interval data with a zero point denoting an absence of the characteristic being measured.||\n# correct, Units sold\nDistance, Time (amount)\nHeight, Weight, Age\nDegrees in K°\nHow you present results is important.

They were unable to move and had no reproductive organs, perhaps reproducing by dropping off new fronds.\nThe creatures, which were neither animals or plants, are called \"rangeomorphs\". They first appeared on the ocean floor 575 million years ago, after the last global glaciation, and were among the first of the soft-bodied creatures in the Ediacaran period. This biota survived until 542 million years ago, when modern animals diversified rapidly in the Cambrian explosion and most Ediacaran species vanished.\nUntil now, almost all Ediacaran fossils were squashed flat, and the few that were not were poorly preserved. This led to debate over whether the poor preservation obscured links to later life, or if the Ediacaran organisms were in fact a failed experiment in evolution that simply became extinct.\nThe newly unearthed fossils, from Newfoundland, Canada, were preserved three-dimensionally in fine-grained mud by a \"one-in-a-million\" streak of luck, says Guy Narbonne of Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.\nJust after a mud flow entombed the organisms, a nearby volcano erupted, covering it with a thick ash protective ash deposit. Later, the bed escaped the strain that altered most of the rock in the region. Now weathering is exposing them so \"they basically pop out of the rock,\" Narbonne told New Scientist. \"You are seeing what they looked like when they were alive.\"\nThat exceptional preservation is cracking the mystery of Ediacara. In some spots the surface has eroded and \"we see for the first time what was inside an Ediacaran fossil,\" Narbonne says.

My Ministry, in appreciating the growing demand for a sewerage system for Kimende Township, has sought the services of the District Planning Officer who is to identify suitable land for the construction of a sewerage disposal system.

The years 1773 to 1780 marked the longest consecutive period of time Mozart would spend in his provincial hometown since his infancy. And despite his international profile, Mozart—who by this time had performed for Louis XV at Versailles and premiered operas in Vienna, Munich, and Milan—held only a modest court position with a meager salary of 150 gulden per year. Making matters worse, the Mozarts’ supportive patron and employer, Archbishop Schrattenbach, had recently died and been succeeded by the unsavory Hieronymus von Colloredo. Colloredo instituted reforms that ultimately diminished Salzburg’s artistic environment, such as eliminating instrumental music from church services and otherwise curtailing public concerts. His relationship with the Mozarts was particularly contentious; failing to appreciate (or acknowledge) the quality of music being produced by his Konzertmeister, Colloredo dismissively suggested that Wolfgang “ought to go to a conservatory in Naples in order to learn music.” While fulfilling his obligations to provide church music (with little effort and even less enthusiasm), Mozart, naturally, became steadily withdrawn from musical life in Salzburg. With an eye towards securing a post in Vienna, Munich, or Paris, he instead focused greater energy on instrumental and secular vocal composition, producing an excellent catalogue of symphonies, violin concerti, piano concerti, arias, serenades, and other works. Such compositions as the Sinfonia concertante had little chance of being heard in Salzburg. Nor was the imbalance of Mozart’s artistic energies lost on the Archbishop.\nIn January 1781, Mozart led the premiere of Idomeneo, his first mature opera, in Munich, which met with great success. Two months later, Mozart was called to Vienna to join Colloredo’s retinue at the celebration of Emperor Joseph II’s accession. Mozart’s offense at being treated again as a common servant, following the great success he had just enjoyed, precipitated his final break with the Archbishop. He remained in Vienna, the musical capital of the Western world, without a court position, in essence becoming history’s first major freelance composer.\nMozart quickly established himself as the finest keyboard player in Vienna, and likewise steadily built his reputation as a composer.", "score": 0.837028682, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:2530a8ae-48b9-4e26-8477-533b91a760d4>", "text": "Break with the Archbishop and left for Vienna (1780-1791)\nWolfgang came so very disappointed in his hometown with his mother's death and the realization of their musical abilities, he had always wanted to travel more and engage with the new cultural realities, surely the little things that do not and provincial Salzburg could offer. In Salzburg, he was employed, like his father, Leopold, the Archbishop's Court, Leopold as vice-director of chapel, organist Wolfgang. In Wolfgang, however, this occupation was closely: while the father was important that the child could consolidate its position as more and more employee with a fixed salary, Wolfgang aspired to something more, perhaps an artist to be completely free. In this sense Mozart was truly a child of his time, that would have brought that era\nBecause of this thirst for freedom, Wolfgang began to have increasingly frequent disagreements with his father (who saw in him a worthy successor to the salary for a job well local court), but also with Hieronymus von Colloredo, Archbishop of Salzburg, which often the biographies of Mozart dedicated judgments ungrateful. Surely he, who can be defined in hindsight a worthy representative of enlightened despotism (he had a bust of Voltaire in his residence), that he did not understand a genius to its service, but it is also true, however, that Mozart should ask more and more licenses often extraordinary and ever-longer, which Colloredo, of course, could not bear. This, inevitably, could only lead to a rupture between the two.\nThe opportunity came soon. Thanks to contacts with Weber, Wolfgang was commissioned opera, Idomeneo, Ilia and Idamante ie, to be performed in Monaco. Convinced he can win the favor with this Court, Mozart fell in composition with enthusiasm, and at the end of 1780 was in the Bavarian capital.

He was baptized on the second day of his birth, and his Christian name was Joannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart.\nFrom an early age, Mozart was studying music, languages, and other subjects. Leopold, Mozart's father, was his only teacher. Young Mozart was keen on music from childhood and wrote his first musical composition when he was four or five years old. When Mozart's talent became evident, his father gave up on composing himself. Mozart wrote the first symphony when he was only eight years old.\nTo show his son's abilities, Leopold used to make European journeys to big cities such as Munich, Paris, London, Amsterdam, and so on, where young Mozart performed and met other composers and musicians. In 1769 father and son left Salzburg for Italy. Mozart and Leopold stayed there for two years. In 1770, a young composer wrote his first opera named Mitridate, re di Porto. It became trendy, and his performances were successful too, but they had to return home.\nIn 1781, Mozart went to Viena, where he found a job at Archbishop Colloredo. He was Archbishop’s private musician, but Mozart had further goals and dreams. He wanted to perform in front of the emperor. After resignment from Colloredo, Mozart became a freelance performer and decided to settle in Viena.\nMozart got married on August 4, 1782, and had six children. Unfortunately, four of them died in infancy. During this period he became acquainted with Bach's and Handel's work and took a great inspiration out of them.

At three he was playing the clavichord, and a year later began writing short compositions. He was a musician capable of playing multiple instruments and gave his first public performance at the age of five at Salzburg University. Between 1763 and 1766 he toured Europe with his father and his sister Nannerl, playing concerts and performing before royalty.\nAfter being appointed Konzertmeister at the Salzburg Court in 1769 he made several tours of Italy to study opera, and composed two of his own, Mitridate and Lucio Silla. Returning to Austria, he wrote all of his violin concertos along with settings of the Catholic mass, symphonies and chamber music, as well as the opera Idomeneo, which became a sensation in Munich. In 1782 Mozart married Constanze Weber, which was also the year his opera Die Entführung aus dem Serail was staged with great success.\nIn the 1780s he composed many sonatas and quartets, and appeared as soloist in the fifteen piano concertos he wrote.

Mozart startled the musical world as an infant prodigy, playing the clavier and composing little pieces before he was five. Leopold wanted to exploit the musical skill of his children; they played before the empress Maria Theresa astonishing everybody. In 1763, Wolofgang and his sister travelled to Munich, Mannheim, Frankfurt, Bruxelles and many other important towns such as Paris, and London where they came in In these years Wolfgang also learnt to play the violin and the organ. In 1767 the Mozarts returned to Salzburg, from this moment the liitle Amadeus started composing and never stopped untill he died.

In 1769 Mozart, together with his father, went to Italy where he visited and played in the main towns, among which Mantova. The Italians were amazed at his genius.\nAn anecdote which happened in Rome increased his infant prodigy fame: in the Sistine Chapel Mozart listened to a piece composed by Gregorio Allegri and rewrote it completly by heart.

Leopold Mozart was to sacrifice his owncareer in order to foster the God-given genius he soon perceived in his son. A childhoodspent in successful tours throughout Europe, in which the young Mozart demonstrated hisskill on the violin, and on the keyboard in improvisation and in performance with hissister Nannerl was followed by a less satisfactory adolescence at home in Salzburg.\nMozart's talent was none the less, but there seemed little opportunity at home,particularly after the death of the old Archbishop and the succession of a less indulgentpatron.

He invented the piano concerto, and pushed the known boundries of music. His works are still revered by scholars and composers worldwide.\nA child genius, who grew up to be a superlative musician, and redefined the scope of music, Mozart's name is synonymous with classical music.\nEarly Days and Career\nMozart was born on January 27, 1751 in Salzburg (mordern-day Austria). While his father was himself a renowned musician, his mother hailed form a nobel family. Mozart started playing the clavier under his father's tutelage at a very young age. By the age of 5, Mozart started composing his own pieces, which were penned down by his father.\nGrowing up, Mozart travelled to various places around Europe with his family. During these travels, he was exposed to various musicians of the time, including Johann Christian Bach, who was a big influence. He also started writing operas and dramas.\nCount Hieronymus von Colloredo the ruler of Salzburg appointed a 22-year-old Mozart as his court musician. During this period, he composed his popular violin concerto series. However, due to relatively low pay, Mozart was forced to look for better opportunities around Europe in 1777.\nHe travelled to Paris, Manheim and Munich looking for better opportunities. During this trip, he wrote the famous Paris Symphony. Unfortunately, his luck ran out and he had to return to Salzburg. However, his father had managed to get him the job of court organist and concertmaster in the Salzburg court.\nIn 1781, on back of the success of the opera Idomeneo, Mozart decided to pursue an independent career in Vienna. His decision was also fuelled by his tiff with Archbishop Colloredo, who was his employer at the time. Mozart thrived in Vienna, and soon became the most sought-after musician there.\nDuring this time, he was reintroduced to the likes of Bach, and he even played with Joseph Haydn. And later on, he even returned to writing operas. This is when he wrote famous pieces like Don Giovanni and The Marriage of Figaro.\nMozart was married to Constanze Weber with whom he had six children.", "score": 0.817937672, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:07b6c0a8-2d4a-458d-b22a-ee3afe6840fb>", "text": "The Provincial Congress named Osgood to the Massachusetts Board of War and he served there until 1780 when the government was reorganized. He was a delegate to the state's constitutional convention in 1779-1780. Under the new Constitution he was elected to the Massachusetts State Senate in 1780 and served two terms. The new government named Osgood as one of their delegates to the Continental Congress and he served there from 1782 until 1784.\nAfter a brief term in the Massachusetts House of Representatives in 1784, the governor appointed Osgood a judge in 1785 but he soon resigned when the National Congress made him a commissioner of the Treasury later that year. He moved to New York City to take up this office, which he held until the Congressional Government ended.\nPostmaster General and New York career\nWhen a new U.S. government was installed in 1789, President Washington appointed Osgood the first Postmaster General under the new U.S. Constitution, replacing Ebenezer Hazard who was commissioned postmaster of the city of New York by the Continental Congress. Osgood served as Postmaster from 1789 to 1791. One of the first things Osgood would do is make the Post Office in Baltimore the new regional headquarters, whose postmaster was Katherine Goddard. Osgood ordered Goddard to resign from her post and was replaced by John White.\nThe seat of the Federal Government at that time was in New York City and the official residence of the President was located at 3 Cherry Street which was the home of Samuel Osgood and his family. Osgood offered the mansion to Washington so that the President and his wife would have what was then considered the finest house in the city as their home. The residence thus became America's first executive mansion.\nWhen the Federal Government moved to Philadelphia for a ten-year period before finally settling in Washington, D.C., Osgood chose to remain in New York and resigned his post in 1791. Osgood was a presidential elector in 1792, and cast his votes for George Washington and George Clinton.\nHe was a member of the New York State Assembly in 1800-01 and 1802, and was Speaker in 1800-01.

During his tenure, a new state house was relocated to Beacon Hill; new armories were set up; the state’s seacoast was strengthened; and the state’s stockpile of weapons was increased. While still in office, Governor Sumner passed away on June 7, 1799. He was buried in the Old Granary Burying Ground in Boston, Massachusetts. Subsequently, the governor’s office remained vacant, which resulted in the Council headed by Thomas Dawes supervising all of the state’s affairs.

Signer Brearly was born in 1745 at Spring Grove near Trenton, was reared in the area, and attended but did not graduate from the nearby College of New Jersey (later Princeton). He chose law as a career and originally practiced at Allentown, NJ. About 1767 he married Elizabeth Mullen.\nBrearly avidly backed the Revolutionary cause. The British arrested him for high treason, but a group of patriots freed him. In 1776 he took part in the convention that drew up the state constitution. During the War for Independence, he rose from a captain to a colonel in the militia.\nIn 1779 Brearly was elected as chief justice of the New Jersey supreme court, a position he held until 1789. He presided over the precedent-setting case of Holmes v. Walton. His decision, rendered in 1780, represented an early expression of the principle of judicial review. The next year, the College of New Jersey bestowed an honorary M.A. degree on him.\nBrearly was 42 years of age when he participated in the Constitutional Convention. Although he did not rank among the leaders, he attended the sessions regularly. A follower of Paterson, who introduced the New Jersey Plan, Brearly opposed proportional representation of the states and favored one vote for each of them in Congress. He also chaired the Committee on Postponed Matters.\nBrearly's subsequent career was short, for he had only 3 years to live. He presided at the New Jersey convention that ratified the Constitution in 1788, and served as a presidential elector in 1789. That same year, President Washington appointed him as a federal district judge, and he served in that capacity until his death.\nWhen free from his judicial duties, Brearly devoted much energy to lodge and church affairs. He was one of the leading members of the Masonic Order in New Jersey, as well as state vice president of the Society of the Cincinnati, an organization of former officers of the Revolutionary War.

Pegg explains the title of his new book Nerd Do Well as a riff on what he claims is the etymology for nerd; he believes it's a shortened form of ne'er-do-well. That, along with many other theories, was debunked by John C. Dvorak in a 1987 PC Magazine column, though some have stubbornly held on to it. John A. Barry, in his 1991 book Technobabble, presents the ne'er-do-well shortening as his own pet theory, though he acknowledges that there's no real evidence for it.\nA useful term for these speculations about word origins comes from Yale linguist Larry Horn: etymythology.

What I talk about in the book mostly is this idea of high achievement, so people becoming great at stuff, becoming really, really good at stuff. I don’t think it’s really important to make a dividing line to try to figure out you know when you’ve crossed over into genius. The point is gathering your resources, doing the best you can, pursuing whatever it is you love to do with an intensity and a resilience and a passion and just going as far as you can possibly go.\nQuestion: Why do you believe the “nature-nurture” distinction to be a false one?\nDavid Shenk: Sure, so this is a big part of my book and it has a long history. We’ve been living with this myth for about a hundred, hundred and fifty years, going back to the time of Darwin, although I’m not blaming Darwin for this. If the blame resides anywhere it’s really with Darwin’s cousin Francis Galton. We can get into that if you’d like, but so the idea is that we think that it’s nature versus nurture, that there is genes that have all this information that kind of want to push us in a certain direction and then there is the environment, which is nurture, which is obviously different and kind of an opposing force and it’s kind of either or and there are all these studies that are constantly trying to figure out well how much is nature and then add onto the nurture. You know is it 60% nature, 40% nurture depending on what trait you’re talking about? Well it turns out that genes don’t work that way. Genes don’t get you part of the way there you know to the point you’re born or the point shortly after that or before that. Genes are always interacting with the environment, so the new way to think about this is that it’s not nature plus nurture on nature versus nurture.

How much do we look for validation of our ideas from others? How often do we give up if we don’t get the kind of validation for our creations that we were seeking?\nKatarina says “One of the things that really kind of changed my world when I heard it was the difference between awareness and input. Input has judgment attached, awareness does not.” When someone tells you what they think about your idea, whether it’s good or bad, some points of view feel kind of “sticky.” That’s input. Somewhere in there is a judgment that stops the expansion of your idea. When there is no judgment it feels different. It kind of glides in and out of your world, it feels light. It’s there, but it isn’t significant.\nWhen you are willing to function from asking for more awareness or information, rather than asking for validation of your creation or ideas of what you are going to do next, or that you have got it right, your creativity becomes a lot more generative.\nAnother key to allowing your creative genius to show up and grow is functioning from choice, and not necessity. Katarina gave a great example of how living from necessity can limit our creative genius: “We grow up being taught we need to have necessities. That is limiting us in finding what we are truly capable of, and our true genius. If we are making money the necessity, we can’t see any of our other capacities that may not look like they are making money!”\nHow do change this and unlock your genius? One of the question Katarina loves to ask is: What is so easy for me that I can’t even imagine that anyone would notice it, validate it, acknowledge it or pay for it?", "score": 0.841463387, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:5278e2b2-9b59-4545-a886-34700ca9c561>", "text": "Posted by David FG on March 17, 2006\nIn Reply to: \"Strong back, weak mind\" posted by Ben on March 17, 2006\n: What is the origin of the phrase \"strong back, weak mind\"?

You’ve got Albert Einstein and the theory of relativity, Thomas Edison and the invention of the light bulb, and George Crum, the inventor of the potato chip. Who would ever think of questioning their respective contributions to society?\nFor me, a genius is someone whose accomplishment stands out not necessarily because of how earth shattering their achievement is to society, but rather in the way that their achievement inconspicuously creeps into the fabric of every day life. For a good example of this, please refer back to Mr. Crum and his potato chip.\nSo who would personify my definition of a true genius? General Tso T’sung-t’ang, inventor (or inspiration) for General Tso’s chicken.\nAccording to The Harper Encyclopedia of Military Biography, General Tso was born in Hunan, China and lived from 1812 to 1885. He joined Hunan’s military in 1853 and became a full-fledged general by 1860. During his military career, he was most well known for his leadership in driving out the Taiping rebels from Hunan despite being hopelessly outnumbered. He went on to become a governor of the Chekiang province, and later a secretary of state. He died in Foochow on September 5, 1885, and was considered by many to be a hero.\nDid you notice in the above description that there was no mention of General Tso actually coming up with his chicken dish? In my research of General Tso, at no point did I see any mention of his culinary skills. I never heard any quote from him saying, “You know what? Before the Taiping rebels arrive, I’ve just got to tell you about this chicken dish I came up with the other day.”\nIn fact, in my research, I found General Tso’s name to be spelled in any number of ways, from Tzo, Cho, Chau, Tao, and several other variations. The correct pronunciation of his name ran the gamut as well, although most seemed to agree that it was pronounced, “Sow”, rhyming with “cow”.", "score": 0.840136766, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:d877556a-a74e-4d89-8d6c-7de3b239b82a>", "text": "So there’s no arguing that geniuses are central to advancements in science, technology, and our general understanding of how the world and the human body work. But what if the definition of genius encompassed a much broader array of accomplishments? What if each one of us possesses an inner genius that’s aching to come out and contribute to the world in some way, but just needs a gentle nudge? Interestingly, the word genius, which comes from Latin, literally means “attendant spirit present from birth.” This definition implies that we have an internal spirit who guards and protects us, giving rise to our natural abilities. In fact, from this word we get genie, as in the genie in the bottle of Arabian folklore.\nWe may never know precisely how one person ends up with the right balance of brainpower, intelligence, and supernatural creativity to become the type of genius who can keep company with Leonardo da Vinci, Thomas Edison, and Marie Curie (the first woman to win the Nobel Prize, for her contribution to physics), but for a moment I want you to believe that there’s a hidden genius, a special genie, within you--no matter how we define a genius. In fact, don’t even bother to define the word genius just yet. We’re going to explore the word and its many meanings in this chapter. For now, begin by simply pondering this question: what could you accomplish if you could think like a genius?\nWhat’s in a Genius?\nAlthough we can get one definition of genius from a dictionary, from a purely scientific standpoint we don’t really know how to define who or what a genius is.

You’d think of people like Albert Einstein, who developed the theory of special relativity in 1905 and proved the existence of atoms, which are among the most elementary particles of the universe.

Researchers either display unpardonable naiveté and start from scratch or pretend that they had no predecessors. Did Knobloch, a serious historical linguist, know Spitzer’s articles?

Hho has been used in welding and cutting at high temperatures for many years, but, as of 2010, there are proposals for using it as ordinary car fuel. While this may be possible with the right research, the substance has many dangers that may outweigh its benefits.\nCompression and Explosion\nThe most obvious danger is that of a hydrogen explosion. Build up of Hho gas or a general increase in pressure in the system can create a risk of fire or explosion. According to Computer Newbie, there is documented evidence that Hho has caused serious explosions in the past, such as the 1986 Shuttle Challenger disaster. It is worth noting that if the gas is not under pressure, it is considered less dangerous.\nHaving too lean of a fuel mixture can raise the combustion temperature and damage the engine. When early tests were carried out, lots of engines actually blew up because the fuel setting was too lean. This risk increases if you purchase a cheap imitation of a real Hho car conversion kit. Cheap imitations are easy to spot because they are made from lower quality parts, such as cheap PVC materials and the use of water bottles rather than steel containers. These don't stand up well to the temperature changes and constant jarring of on-road use, which can cause them to crack and break. Also, they are often tricky to install, do not easily adapt from petrol to diesel engines and produce less hydrogen for the price, while reputable manufacturers provide high quality, adaptable generators. One liter of hydrogen per minute represents an acceptable performance.\nFaulty Electrical Wiring\nIf a car gas saver is wired incorrectly, there is the risk of fire and explosion created by sparks or moisture getting onto the faulty wiring. There also is the possibility that other electrical components will suffer interference from the generator, which could create hazards during driving.\nIt must be remembered that Hho is a flammable gas, which makes it great for fuel efficiency proposals but highly dangerous.\nHydrogen Build Up\nAnother danger closely linked to explosion is the risk of a buildup of highly combustible hydrogen gas. Flash arrestors, or one-way valves, minimize the risk, but if they are incorrectly installed or fail, the whole system becomes extremely explosive.", "score": 0.826282918, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:44170af3-b952-437e-a29a-b2133d4497d3>", "text": "HT Based Catalysts for Ethanol Steam Reforming\nNowadays, ethanol (C2H5OH/Et-OH) has become a potential source of hydrogen (H2). Ethanol for hydrogen production is advantageous than natural gas and liquefied petroleum as it is renewable (bio-ethanol), non-toxic, easy to handle and high hydrogen yield . Hydrogen from ethanol can be produced by partial oxidation, steam reforming or oxidative reforming method. Among these methods, ethanol steam reforming has a higher H2 yield as part of it comes from Steam. Moreover, ethanol steam reforming is easy to apply process. Equations (5) and (6) present the prime reactions of ethanol steam reforming.\nHowever, C2H5OH steam reforming is a complicated process, where the number of reactions such as dehydrogenation, dehydration, coking, and decomposition can take place successively or even simultaneously . Temperature management during C2H5OH steam reforming is a significant issue due to the endothermic nature of ethanol steam reforming reaction and the necessity of continuous heat supply . Moreover, methane formation during ethanol steam reforming Equation (7) decreases H2 yield.\nTo overcome such obstacles, catalysts can play an important role. Catalysts can effectively reduce operating temperature and prevent methane formation  . Previous studies revealed that noble metal-derived catalysts exhibited good results for ethanol H2O reforming . However, noble metal-based catalysts become deactivated over time during ethanol steam reforming due to the carbonaceous material deposition on the surface of the catalyst.

Due to its ever-increasing industrial relevance, there is a need for efficient methods of hydrogen production, which has traditionally been done at a high temperature.\nSteam methane reforming is a chemical process by which methane is converted to hydrogen. It involves the reaction between natural gas, which contains methane and steam. It is done at a temperature of 700-1000°C and under a pressure of 3-25 bar.\nThe products of this chemical process are initially hydrogen and carbon monoxide. The carbon monoxide is further reacted with steam in a water-gas shift reaction to produce more hydrogen and carbon dioxide. Impurities are then removed from the system using pressure-swing adsorption. As a result, pure hydrogen is isolated and extracted.\nThis process is mediated by reformer tubes – also known as catalyst tubes used in steam reformer furnaces known as steam methane reformers.\nImportance of Steam Methane Reforming\nSteam methane reforming is currently the most used method of producing hydrogen. It is the preferred method for refineries, metal processing, heating furnaces, power generation, heat exchangers and several others. Therefore, the method that produces the greatest amount of hydrogen is the most attractive. Many industries prefer the steam methane reforming method because it produces a high amount of hydrogen, in addition to the hydrogen being very pure.\nHydrogen production is a capital-intensive project. The steam methane reforming method is a system that makes the most of the resources given. The stepwise set of reactions occurs almost simultaneously within the system. This gives the highest pure hydrogen yield with little wastage along the way.\nRegardless of the industry, businesses characteristically appreciate capital cost-saving strategies or systems. As a result, steam methane reforming accounts for most of the hydrogen produced worldwide.\nTemp-Pro Thermocouples Increase the Effectiveness of Steam Methane Reformers\nThe performance of steam methane reforming SMR can be improved through the use of thermocouples. A thermocouple is a device that is used to measure temperature. This device is integral to the steam methane reforming process. Without careful monitoring of the amount of heat being produced, the process cannot be successfully managed.\nWhen it comes to producing thermocouples for steam methane reformers, no one does it better than Temp-Pro.", "score": 0.825637281, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:dea00cea-1dd8-4493-9d2f-6f42ec745063>", "text": "Are you worried about your operators safety?\nDo you want to learn the butane extraction process?\nAt Summit we aim to set the standard for operator safety and strive to decrease processing times with our equipment.\nEach class offers a unique hands-on experience with a closed loop extraction system, and various post processing equipment.\nOne 8-hour class session includes:\n• Botanical Oil Extraction Safety Review\n• Hydrocarbon Extraction Review\n• Operation of the Summit T1 Extraction System\no Performed in a HAL Extraction Booth\no Process hemp plant feed\n• Operation of a Rotary Evaporator (Ethanol)\n• Operation of a Vacuum Oven (Post-Purge)\n• Winterization - Filtration of botanical oils\n• Chemical Hazards Review\n• Hazardous Location Review\nThis event does not accept refunds", "score": 0.825190544, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:8a0f5699-50cd-48a8-8fba-883216f8eb0d>", "text": "Stricter environmental emissions regulations and increased processing of severe crude oil fractions is causing H2 demand to grow across the refining industry.

Praxair's patented oxygen enhanced reforming (OER) technology can expand H2 plant production capacity at a low capital investment. In OER, O2 is used to enrich steam methane reformer combustion air and increase the amount of heat made available to drive the endothermic steam reforming reactions. Incremental H2 is produced without exceeding induced draft fan capacity, reformer tube metal temperature, front-end process pressure, and total reformer firing rate limitations. The O2 injection method can be custom designed to minimize the impact of NOx emissions and the simple, reliable OER retrofit equipment can be installed with little to no plant downtime. This paper will present the results of techno-economic assessments performed on OER retrofits that were designed to increase production in existing H2 plants.\nWould you like to access this content?\nNo problem.

In conformity with Table 2 hydrogen productivity from SRM when HT derived catalysts were used is presented below in Figure 1.\n3.3. HT Derived Catalysts for Methanol Steam Reforming\nMethanol is a promising fuel and it is considered as an attractive hydrogen storage medium as the gravimetric hydrogen density of CH3OH is much higher than that of compressed or liquid hydrogen . The use of methanol for hydrogen storage is advantageous as the necessity of cryogenic or pressurized containers can be avoided. The liberation of hydrogen for methanol can be done by several catalytic reactions such as methanol decomposition, WGS (water gas shift) reaction, methanol steam reforming and partial oxidation of CH3OH. Among these reactions, methanol steam reforming reaction is more convenient for H2 production due to low operational temperature (300˚C - 400˚C), no direct CO production and highest H2 concentration in the product stream . The reaction for CH3OH steam reforming is presented in Equation (4) below.\nFigure 1. Performance of different HT based catalysts during SMR.\nHowever, obstacles like high endothermicity and rapid speed variation of methanol steam reforming reaction affect H2 production. To overcome these problems partial oxidation methods and effective catalysts are used . Broadly applied catalysts for CH3OH steam reforming are zinc oxide, copper, and alumina containing materials which are usually synthesized via co-precipitation method from malachite-boehmite precursor . Hydrotalcite derived materials having copper (Cu), zinc (Zn) and aluminum (Al) are found to have potential applications as a catalyst for methanol steam reforming . In recent years, researchers experimented with hydrotalcite (Htlc) based catalysts containing different Zn, Cu, and Al ratios and metal promoted Zn, Cu, Al-Htlc catalysts for enhancing productivity during methanol steam reforming.", "score": 0.005863342737865799, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:44170af3-b952-437e-a29a-b2133d4497d3>", "text": "Chemical Engineering Research and Design, 91, 581-592.\n Moura, J.S., Souza, M.O., Bellido, J.D.A., Assaf, E.M., Opportus, M., Reyes, P., et al.

Without clean and reliable data, it’s useless to even analyze it for accurate results.\nCross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM)\nContinuing our knowledge journey, let’s look at the CRISP-DM process. Data scholars designed the CRISP-DM model to aid data explorers in their journey to better understand data. CRISP is an acronym that stands for Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM). According to Hunter (2009), CRISP is a process model that provides a framework for carrying out data mining projects, which is independent of both the industry and technology used.\nSource: (Vorhies, 2016) | Image: CRISP-DM Process\nAs outlined in the CRISP model above, the six phases of CRISP-DM include:\nBusiness Understanding – In this phase, hypothesizes are established, the goals of the project are defined, project plans are created, left & right project boundaries are outlined, timelines and expectations are set (Hunter, 2009). Without this step, we lack direction.\nData Understanding – During this phase, the data is collected from its sources, its relationships are assessed, and often requires domain subject matter expertise (Hunter, 2009). Important to note, Hunter states that while exploring the data and its relationships, analysts often discover new insights and further develop their business understanding (2009).\nData Preparation – This phase involves selecting the appropriate data and cleaning it (Hunter, 2009). Data Cleaning, Data Integration, Data Reduction, and Data Transformation are all major tasks associated with data preprocessing, which aid in data preparation (Han, J., Pei, J., and Kamber, M., 2011).\nModeling – During this phase, a variety of data modeling techniques can be used to generate models to assess whether a hypothesis is true or false. This phase also uses advanced algorithms to assess models. According to Hunter (2009), additional data preparation may be necessary to properly use particular algorithms for testing.\nEvaluation – In this phase, we determine how to use the model(s). Models created in the previous phase are assessed and a select few are chosen based on their ability to achieve the desired outcomes initially outlined during the business understanding phase (Hunter, 2009).", "score": 0.836890101, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:1a099b06-4a26-4201-b163-05922216c9c9>", "text": "- Learn how to perform data transformations with Kinesis Data Firehose.\nGet started with Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose", "score": 0.834241033, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:39f673a4-7fe1-4939-aaa2-fc63e6fbb24f>", "text": "The Five Phases are:\n- Planning and Initial Upgrade\n- Analysis and the Upgrade Assistant\n- Final Upgrade and Go-Live\nPlanning and Initial Upgrade\nBegin your upgrade by reviewing information on the Infor E:Info web site. This valuable resource provides all the information you need to plan your upgrade. You will need to create a separate environment (do not share applications) and perform the upgrade of the MAPICS applications as directed. This environment should be brought up to the latest PCM level with all critical PTFs applied. It will be used for integration and testing of your customizations.\nAnalysis and the upgrade assistant\nFor example, if your current environment is MM, the target environment is NN, and all your custom code is contained in two libraries – CUSTOM and CUSTOMF, your configuration would be similar to this:\nThe Analysis Results file produced by the Upgrade Assistant is in standard comma-separated variable format (.csv) which you can download and import in to EXCEL for use in managing your integration effort. It includes columns for the following information:\nThe analysis tool makes recommendations as to the action you should take for each referenced object.\n0 – No action required for this object\n1 – Recompile only\n2 – Modified object requires detailed analysis\nThe first step of the database analysis process involves reviewing the Before/After Record Layouts for changed MAPICS files that were generated by the tool. If you determine that the changes to a file are non-critical, you filter records in the spreadsheet that reference that file and change the action from a ‘3’ to ‘1’ to indicate recompile. If the changes are critical, you change the action flag to ‘2’ indicating that a detailed review of the logic will be necessary. Critical changes may include changes in field length or type, change in keys or select/omit criteria, or deleted fields.\nWhen the data base analysis is complete, you review each custom object to determine if it can be recompiled or if further analysis is required. The action for the object will typically be the highest action assigned to one of its referenced objects. Excel provides easy sorting and filtering to make this task quite easy.\nAs you integrate the MAPICS changes with your custom applications, you will place all new objects in your test environment, which was installed as a part of the initial upgrade to a new release.", "score": 0.832389534, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:46dff012-1b20-42cd-bb12-a651096c4f11>", "text": "Data Preprocessors - Cleaning Data and Removing Noise¶\nData preprocessing describes the process in which a noisy data set is processed into a cleaned data set by transforming its data features.

However, we found that different data preprocessing methods show quite different effects on clustering algorithms. Moreover, there is no specific preprocessing method that is applicable to all clustering algorithms, and even for the same clustering algorithm, the best preprocessing method depends on the input data. Results We designed a graph-based algorithm, SC3-e, specifically for discriminating the best data preprocessing method for SC3, which is currently the most widely used clustering algorithm for single cell clustering. When tested on eight frequently used single-cell RNA-seq data sets, SC3-e always accurately selects the best data preprocessing method for SC3 and therefore greatly enhances the clustering performance of SC3. Conclusion The SC3-e algorithm is practically powerful for discriminating the best data preprocessing method, and therefore largely enhances the performance of cell-type clustering of SC3. It is expected to play a crucial role in the related studies of single-cell clustering, such as the studies of human complex diseases and discoveries of new cell types.", "score": 0.0038664611700700126, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:aff001b8-3fcb-4349-9df7-6c418a0ce1ea>", "text": "Each line unit can comprise a multiplexer with a first input connected to a voice digital line and at least a second and a third input connected to the generator of digital control signals, from which generator the multiplexer receives a signal representing the silence in the coding adopted for voice signals, and a signal having a frequency within the telephone band, the multiplexer switching being controlled by the preprocessing device.\nA first and a second control circuit are connected to the output of the multiplexer for detecting the presence of the silence coding signal and of the signal in the telephone band, sent by the local generator or the announcement data base, the circuits emitting logic signals indicating the occurred detection.\nAlso a switching circuit is connected to the multiplexer output and both to one of the lines for connection to the network and to the test telephone criteria generator, in order to connect the line unit to the network or to the test criteria generator.\nA logic network controls the switching circuit and allows the switching circuit to be operated either by the preprocessing device or by a manual control device, the logic networks of all units being connected together so that only one switching circuit at a time can be manually operated and that the operation of a switching circuit by the preprocessing device hinders manual operation of other switching circuits and disconnects from test criteria generator a line unit possibly connected to that generator via manual operation of the switching circuit.\nA sensor set is connected to the outputs of the control circuits and to the wires of the line for connection to the network in order to receive the logic signals emitted by said circuits and the telephone criteria present on the line, and also connected to the preprocessing device, to which the sensors send the data represented by the signals and/or criteria sensed.\nA driver set connected on one side to the multiplexer, the control logic of the switching circuit and the line for connection to the network and on the other side to the preprocessing device from which the individual drivers receive information and commands related to the operation of the multiplexer or the switching circuit or to criteria to be sent towards the network.\nThe decoding logic network connected to the preprocessing device and to the sensor and driver sets, the logic network receiving from the preprocessing device and decoding signals which select a sensor or sensors which must supply data to the preprocessing device, or respectively a driver or drivers which must receive data and/or commands from the preprocessing device.", "score": 0.0035178065717641222, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:5e20332c-c0eb-40ba-815c-e63cfc37a4c3>", "text": "Why should startups use the MLOps platform?\nBusinesses have started adapting MLOps as part of their operations. Startups need to quickly grow their operations and the MLOps platform guarantees accelerated growth for startups by providing ML models that impact the business sales and help make forecasts, and also gather data that help in business analysis, it also gives the startup an edge over existing competition. ML models built with MLOps platforms are reliable and accurate.\nThis article discusses MLOps platforms and the advantages of a startup using these MLOps platforms.\nWhat is MLOps?\nMachine learning Operations (MLOps) is a process that involves the collaboration of data scientists, machine learning engineers, and businesses for the production of machine learning models which are then deployed. MLOps covers the machine learning lifecycle from data collection to model monitoring and model management. MLOps can also be integrated with DevOps to ensure continuous integration, deployment, and monitoring.\nIt also provides an end-to-end pipeline for building and deploying reliable machine learning models.\nPhases of MLOps life cycle\n- Team integration and Business requirements: The required team needs to be set up which consists of the data scientist, machine learning engineers, and operation managers.\n- Data collection, analysis, and preprocessing: This involves the gathering of data that is needed to build the machine learning models, most times this data is usually raw and unclean, so preprocessing techniques like handling of missing values, outlier detection, and encoding needs to be carried out So that the data can be analyzed and concept models can be built.\n- Model training, evaluation & deployment: This is the stage where the machine learning model is trained from the data collected, ML algorithms like regression, deep learning, Naïve Bayes, decision trees, etc. are applied to the data to analyze its pertain and learn from it. The ML model is stored In a model hub, the ML model is then evaluated and tested on the test data before deployment.\n- MLOps pipeline (Continuous integration, monitoring, and deployment): After this ML model is built, then a pipeline is used to ensure continuous integration, monitoring of the modelops, and deployment of the ML models. This will help ensure that it performs well in production.\nWhat are MLOps platforms and their examples?\nMLOps platforms are frameworks or tools that help manage the machine learning lifecycle and provide infrastructure and processes for the successful development of ML models at scale.", "score": 0.002772450711260264, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:14f63a72-5611-4085-9fb8-1323beca8f3a>", "text": "Plot, strain, and spectrogram are just some of the data visualization tools available in MATLAB. The graph function can be used to display the amplitude of a signal in the time domain over a period of time. The frequency content of a signal in the frequency domain can be obtained with the fft function and displayed with the graph function. Time-varying signals can also be seen with the help of spectrograms.\nData visualization in signal processing is also useful for identifying outliers and repeating patterns. Low-pass filters, high-pass filters, and bandpass filters are useful tools for doing this with your data. Filters can be used to clean up a signal by removing artifacts, isolating certain frequencies, or filtering out background noise. The next section will explain how to pre-process the data to improve its quality and prepare it for analysis after it has been viewed and checked for anomalies.\nThe next phase in signal processing, after data input and display, is data preprocessing. In preprocessing, errors and artifacts are corrected and the signal-to-noise ratio is improved. This is critical to signal processing because it ensures that the data is of sufficient quality for accurate analysis. Filtering, resampling, and normalization are just a few of the many preprocessing tools available in MATLAB.\nIn signal processing, filtering is a standard method for preprocessing raw data. Filtering is the process of cleaning a signal by removing any extraneous elements, including noise or artifacts. Low-pass filters, high-pass filters, and bandpass filters are just some of the data filtering tools available in MATLAB. Data can be filtered in many ways using tools such as filter, fir1 and designfilt. Data can also be adjusted using the normalize function and resampled to a standard sample rate with the resample function.\nIn signal processing, feature extraction is a critical part of the preprocessing phase. Aspects of the data, including frequency content, amplitude, and time-varying behavior, can be extracted through a process called feature extraction. This helps focus attention on the most relevant aspects of the data, which is critical for signal processing. Fft, wavelet analysis, and time-frequency analysis are just some of the feature extraction tools available in MATLAB. Depending on the type of signal being studied, these functions can be used to extract different aspects of the data.\nAfter data preprocessing, the next step in signal processing is transformation.", "score": 0.002529634086304586, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:867db6ef-01ac-4fbe-9c2f-6f653c6c6eca>", "text": "Input pipeline dashboard\nTo open the input pipeline analyzer, select Profile, then select input_pipeline_analyzer from the Tools dropdown.\nThe dashboard contains three sections:\n- Summary - Summarizes the overall input pipeline with information on whether your application is input bound and, if so, by how much\n- Device-side analysis - Displays detailed, device-side analysis results, including the device step-time and the range of device time spent waiting for input data across cores at each step\n- Host-side analysis - Shows a detailed analysis on the host side, including a breakdown of input processing time on the host\nInput pipeline summary\nThe Summary reports if your program is input bound by presenting the percentage of device time spent on waiting for input from the host.

Whether that’s a surgery or ongoing care for rehabilitation & physiotherapy.\nThat’s why having proper medical insurance that covers sport is so important.\nHow can I protect myself?\nThe answer is simple, when you’re taking out a plan, make sure whatever sport you play is covered under the policy. Seems simple enough, but many times this isn’t even something that’s considered when taking out a medical insurance plan. As someone from the UK, I know this wasn’t something I had even considered as it’s not something I’ve ever had to think about back at home.\nEqually as important, make sure you’re covered in the countries you play in.

Shortly thereafter, a cooperating research group showed that the “Prevent Injury Enhance Performance” (PEP) programme effectively reduced the incidence of ACL ruptures in female football players.\nBased on these two initial studies and the meanwhile accumulated body of knowledge, F-MARC developed a simple, catchy and time efficient preventive programme called “The 11” targeting amateur players.\nTo some extent, improved players´ fitness and skills can prevent injuries, however, a substantial amount of injuries is caused by foul play.

An effective way to help protect both kids and grownups from sustaining serious sports injuries is by providing them with high-quality mouthguards. The best place to get an effective, custom-fitted mouthguard is from your dentist, Dr. Winter in Beverly Hills, MI.\nAccording to Dentistry Today, “Approximately one third of all dental injuries are sports related.” When we think about sports-related injuries, high-speed contact sports like football, martial arts, ice hockey, and basketball are typically the first sports to come to mind.\nBut even such non-contact sports as skating and gymnastics can result in injuries to the mouth, teeth, jaw, and gums. In fact, the Academy of Sports Dentistry has compiled a list of 40 sports in which protective mouth gear would be beneficial for participants.\nWhat’s a Mouthguard?\nA mouthguard is a flexible, custom-fitted device worn over teeth during athletic events or recreational activities to protect the soft tissue in the mouth from trauma. A mouthguard provides the following advantages:\n- Reducing the risk of sports injuries\n- Buffering damage to teeth\n- Protecting the cheek, especially for athletes who wear braces\n- Extra protection for athletes with fixed bridges and other dental work\n- Distributes the force of an impact over a wider area\n- Minimizes the risk of broken teeth and other damage to soft tissue\n- Helps athletes feel more confident\nYour Custom-Fitted Mouthguard from Dr. Winter\nThe best way to protect yourself and your kids from sports-related mouth injuries by getting a custom-fitted mouthguard from Dr. Winter. The “boil and bite” mouthguards you’ll at find your local sporting goods store don’t provide the type of comprehensive protection you’ll get from a mouthguard provided by Dr. Winter.\nAlthough mouth protectors typically only cover the upper teeth, your dentist or orthodontist may suggest that you use a mouth protector on the lower teeth if you have braces on these teeth too.

There may be a new repellent on the horizon—and it's \"so much better than anything else we've ever seen,\" its inventor says.\nA few years ago, Ulrich Bernier was busy blending various chemicals together in the lab, hoping to figure out why the blood-sucking insects bite some people more than others. Mosquitoes home in on their targets by sniffing out various chemicals and bacteria on human skin.\nWhen he created one blend with a group of chemicals that are very similar to ones found in low concentrations in our bodies, Bernier noticed that the bugs seemed to ignore it. (Read what happens inside you when a mosquito bites.)\nThese chemicals—which include the tongue twisters homopiperazine and 1-methylhomopiperazine, among others—seemed to have an incredibly robust ability to mask our scent from mosquitoes, said Bernier, a research chemist at the United States Department of Agriculture's Agricultural Research Service.\nNext, Bernier and colleagues set up an experiment where people put their arms or hands inside a cage full of mosquitoes. The insects avoided the skin of the subjects when the chemical cocktail was released from a container inside the cage.\nBernier and colleagues created a formula of several chemicals for a repellent, which was approved by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in 2012.\n\"It's a pretty neat discovery because I don't think anyone else has shown chemicals this capable of blocking skin odors that are normally attractive to mosquitoes,\" said Bernier, who presented the research at the American Chemical Society meeting in Indianapolis last week.\nWhy do we need a new repellent?\nInsect-borne diseases are prevalent and potentially dangerous. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there are about 30,000 annual reported cases of Lyme disease, which is transmitted by ticks, and at least a thousand annual cases of mosquito-caused encephalitis—which includes West Nile virus—in the country. Bernier and colleagues' new repellent is also effective against other blood-sucking insects.\nThe most common insect repellent now in use is DEET, which is designed to be sprayed on the skin. However, there has been some concern about DEET and potential toxicity, and there's high demand for equally effective alternatives. (See \"Mutant Mosquitoes Not Repelled by DEET.\")\nHow does it work?", "score": 0.858361483, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:a6e437fe-8036-4ccf-9b84-82f42abed54f>", "text": "Researchers at Vanderbilt looking for better ways to control the spread of malaria have stumbled across an insect repellent that is thousands of times stronger than DEET. But it doesn’t just work to confuse malaria-carrying mosquitoes. This new compound works against all insects, including flies, ants, and moths.\nThe compound known as VUAA1 was borne of recent discoveries about the fundamental way that mosquitoes smell. Just a few years ago, it was thought that the basic sniffing mechanism for mosquitoes was very similar to that of mammals--that is, that odorant receptors (ORs) sitting atop nerve cells are tuned to different molecules, and when a receptor comes in contact with its target molecule it notifies the brain via the nerve.But mosquitoes’ olfactory senses works a bit differently. It turns out their ORs rely on a sort of nerve switchboard, a co-receptor called Orco. When an OR detects an odorant molecule, it activates while the other ORs on a given antenna remain deactivated. The Orco acts as a sort of switch that tells the brain which OR is activated, and thus what molecule is being detected.\nVUAA1 is basically a molecule that triggers the Orco directly rather than the ORs seperately. Like a sort of universal signal, it stimulates all OR-Orco connections, essentially simulating the effect of all the different receptors on an antenna firing at once. For the mosquito, this creates sensory overload, like tasting something that tastes like every possible flavor at once. In the presence of VUAA1, mosquitoes basically can’t smell anything, which confounds their ability to sniff out blood or anything else.\nNow the obvious question is: what else does VUAA1 do? The Vanderbilt team is working to better characterize the compound and to strip away any parts of it that don’t contribute to its effectiveness. They will then start testing it for toxicity and other attributes that might have negative impacts on people or the environment.\nThe good news is that even if there doesn’t happen to be a safe commercial application for VUAA1, the science is still there. Having found this unique means to overwhelm the common mosquito could lead to better future repellents that keep mosquitoes and other pests at bay (without being deadly/toxic), be it in malaria-prone regions of the world, in agricultural settings, or simply in the backyard.\nFive amazing, clean technologies that will set us free, in this month's energy-focused issue.", "score": 0.858103514, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:372c4770-b2bf-481a-a0a4-8f932a701a2a>", "text": "MOSQUITO CONTROL SERVING THE ENTIRE TRIAD REGION OF NORTH CAROLINA\n3 STEPS TO A BACKYARD WITH NO MOSQUITOES\nAND THEIR LARVAE\nTREAT THE ENTIRE\nREMOVE ALL ADULT\nLAY A RESIDUAL BARRIER\nSAFELY AND EFFECTIVELY\nFOR WEEKS TO COME\nTHIS MONTHLY SERVICE TURNS YOUR PROPERTY INTO A NO-FLY ZONE FOR THE SEASON\nClean, Professional, and Courteous\nOur technicians will arrive at your home in a clearly marked vehicle.

DeVries and his team measured the levels of dust before and after heat treatment and insecticide applications by a professional pest control company.\nWhen the dust was tested, it was revealed that a variety of substances were found in it, such as pollen, human skin cells, and bacteria. However, when compared to apartments not previously infested with bed bugs, there was a higher level of histamine found in the apartments that were known to be dealing with an active or past infestation. In fact, homes with bed bug infestations tested about twenty times higher in histamine than in homes with no bed bug history.\n“Bed bugs leave behind waste that contains histamine.

In most places people have to fend for themselves against the pests by sleeping under mosquito nets or using repellent.\nA number of new repellent formulas have hit the market in recent years, but many have questionable efficacy. So researchers at New Mexico State University decided to compare the effectiveness of different repellents and perfumes, according to a study published recently in the Journal of Insect Science.\nThe researchers tested eight commercially available repellents, two fragrances, and a vitamin B patch that reportedly keeps the mosquitoes at bay, on two different species of disease-carrying mosquitoes.\nTo test the efficacy of each, the researchers put a mosquito at the long end of a Y-shaped plastic tube. One of the researchers who is particularly attractive to mosquitoes placed her two hands at the ends of both forked tubes—one hand was untreated, the other treated with the chemical being tested. If the mosquito avoided the tube with the treated hand by staying still or moving towards the untreated hand, the researchers determined that the repellent worked.\nThe researchers found that, among repellents, those that contained the tried-and-true ingredient DEET were most effective in warding off the mosquitoes. A few others, such as Cutter Lemon Eucalyptus Insect Repellent, worked almost as well, while most of them (including the vitamin patch) didn't make any difference.\nThose findings weren't unexpected. But the researchers were surprised to find that Avon Skin So Soft Bath Oil repelled the mosquitoes for about two hours. Another fragrance, Victoria's Secret Bombshell perfume, also repelled the mosquitoes and lasted even longer.\nThis surprise overturns the previous understanding about how mosquitoes interpret scents.\n\"There was some previous literature that said fruity, floral scents attracted mosquitoes, and to not wear those,\" said Stacy Rodriguez, a research assistant involved in the study, said in a statement. \"It was interesting to see that the mosquitoes weren't actually attracted to the person that was wearing the Victoria's Secret perfume – they were repelled by it.\"\nThe takeaway for the researchers is that the repellents with DEET were as a whole more effective than those without, which is useful information to consumers.

During the height of breeding season, these parasites outnumber every other animal on the planet, except for termites and ants. Unfortunately, mosquito bites don’t affect only humans, they also transmit life-threatening parasites and illnesses such as heartworm disease in animals like dogs, cats and horses, too.\nDid you know mosquitoes are the deadliest animal on the planet, causing more deaths annually than sharks, snakes, wolves, lions, crocodiles, tigers, bears and humans combined? There are currently over 3,500 recorded species of mosquitoes—one hundred of which can be found in the United States. While mosquitoes are extremely adaptable and can live in a wide variety of environments, they tend to prefer warmer tropical climates. The females bite and extract blood in order to support the growth of their eggs, which they deposit into shallow water.\n[contact-form-7 id=”6709″ title=”Contact form 1″]\nLeave a Message\nPO Box 490935\nLawrenceville, GA. 30049", "score": 0.854406178, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:4ec9e9d0-6d75-4cce-be89-3633b2175f3f>", "text": "If you've spent much time outdoors, chances are you've had to fight with mosquitoes intent on making you a meal.

We know they bite but what we often don’t consider is that they can transmit serious and sometimes deadly diseases. In fact, a recent survey of locals indicated that knowledge of mosquito-borne disease is pretty limited, particularly among younger adults aged 18-34 years and those living in the Perth Metro. It’s pretty important we’re aware of the risks posed by these pint-sized blood suckers and how you can avoid them… and here’s why!\nOn average, more than 1,000 people will be infected with a mosquito-borne disease in WA every year. Our mossies can transmit Ross River virus, Barmah Forest virus, West Nile virus (Kunjin substrain) and Murray Valley encephalitis virus. All four cause diseases that are debilitating at best, causing weeks to months of symptoms. Murray Valley encephalitis is limited to the north of the State but is so serious it can result in seizures, coma, brain damage and even death.\nForget the bush, most people bitten in their own backyard. West Aussies are all very prone to getting eaten alive while socialising outdoors but if you’re up in the north of the State, you’ve also got a much higher likelihood of being bitten while boating, camping or fishing or working outside, compared to the rest of the state.\nAnd don’t think you’re off the hook when you head off on holidays. A further 500 WA residents return from overseas travel with an exotic mosquito-borne disease every year. Heading to Bali? Beware of dengue, especially young adult males who return home with the illness more than others.

After all the restrictions and social distancing measures you’ve had to adhere to for an entire year, you’re finally ready to let loose and immerse yourself in the liberating tropical setting of Costa Rica’s rainforests.\nYou’re itching to do this but you also have in the back of your mind the stories of vacationers getting seriously sick or dying in this Central American country due to mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue, Zika, and more. So, how bad is the mosquito problem really in Costa Rica? This is what we look to answer in this guide on mosquitoes in Costa Rica.\nSo How Bad Are Mosquitoes in Costa Rica?\nWhile Costa Rica has some incredible biodiversity, not all the inhabitants in its rainforests are deserving of a postcard. In reality, many are feared, like the mosquito, as they are able to transmit diseases such as Chikungunya, dengue, and Zika.\nAlthough these diseases are a major issue in Costa Rica, a little bit of awareness can go a long way in avoiding them. Here, we will look at the most common mosquito-borne illnesses in Costa Rica, their symptoms, and how to treat them. This way you will not only know how bad the mosquito problem is in Costa Rica but you will also discover ways to overcome it.\nThe Mosquito-Borne Diseases in Cost Rica, Their Symptoms, and Prevention\nAs a tourist in the country, you should be aware that the government of Costa Rica takes mosquito-borne diseases extremely seriously and is always looking to slow the transmission of such diseases. This should give you some level of confidence that you’re not on your own when it comes to protecting yourself against mosquito-borne diseases in Costa Rica.\nHowever, you can increase your protection against these diseases further by having knowledge about the illnesses borne by mosquitoes in Costa Rica, how you can identify them, and the ways to treat them. Let’s begin.\nThe Zika Virus\nA mosquito-borne disease that has recently become a cause of fear in Costa Rica and across Latin America is the Zika virus. In 2016, a few hundred cases were reported in Costa Rica. However, the numbers continuously declined, and the virus outbreak that was all over the news back then never really got off the ground and we are thankful for that.", "score": 0.00023894923567665822, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:417ce8d6-b1ce-4060-9b6e-1e9024ba1792>", "text": "Our district worked out a plan for eradication of the yellow fever mosquitoes downtown through street by street and door-to-door for inspection and treatment.\nAs the letter writer, Nancy Hutton, said, our county is always overrun with tourists.

Our district, under AMCD’s board of commissioners’ direction and leadership, staff expertise and the support of and the county board of health, we have developed a response plan and control strategy for prevention and control of mosquito-borne diseases in the past 12 years. Our county has been free of any locally-acquired mosquito-borne diseases since 2003.\nOur district’s response to any suspected human cases is based on the dispersal or flying distance, behavior and habitats of vector mosquito species after we receive the information about suspected human case from the health department. For prevention and control of yellow fever mosquitoes and Asian Tiger Mosquitoes (container-breeding mosquitoes), we used the barrier perimeter strategy. We enhanced the surveillance, residential and community education, source reduction and treatment by using Ultra-low volume foggers, barrier-spraying, thermal fogging and other practical control techniques, based on local environmental conditions within a mile, because Yellow Fever and Asian Tiger mosquitoes fly only short distances. This successful strategy and method have been adopted by other mosquito control programs.\nMs. Hutton is right. Now it is the time for our mosquito control staff and health department staff to conduct public education for emptying containers, personal protection and prevention against mosquito bites — and to expand treatment rates and areas in order to fight the spread of vector mosquitoes and the Zika virus.\nAMCD is a local governmental entity and a tax authority. Our commissioners set the emerging fund for the response to the possible outbreaks of any kind of mosquito-borne diseases when they set up the annual budget — which specifically includes funding for an response to and control of, a mosquito-borne disease outbreak. The district increased surveillance, inspection, education, treatment and funding for vector mosquitoes after we received the first imported Zika case in our county. Also, the district has planned and arranged to search and apply for more grants to study where our Yellow Fever mosquitoes and the insecticide susceptibility, control technology and strategy against these vector mosquitoes.\nCurrently there are 79 imported Zika cases in Florida.", "score": 0.00023566778587761256, "source": "sparse"}]}

Mathematical models describing avascular tumor growth distinguish between necrosis and apoptosis as distinct cell loss mechanisms: necrosis occurs when the nutrient level is insufficient to sustain the cell population, whereas apoptosis can occur in a nutrient-rich environment and usually occurs when the cell exceeds its natural lifespan. Experiments suggest that changes in the proliferation rate can trigger changes in apoptotic cell loss and that these changes do not occur instantaneously: they are mediated by growth factors expressed by the tumor cells. In this paper, we consider two ways of modifying the standard model of avascular tumor growth by incorporating into the net proliferation rate a time-delayed factor. In the first case, the delay represents the time taken for cells to undergo mitosis. In the second case, the delay represents the time for changes in the proliferation to stimulate compensatory changes in apoptotic cell loss. Numerical and asymptotic techniques are used to show how a tumor's growth dynamics are affected by including such delay terms. In the first case, the size of the delay does not affect the limiting behavior of the tumor: it simply modifies the details of its evolution. In the second case, the delay can alter the tumor's evolution dramatically. In certain cases, if the delay exceeds a critical value, defined in terms of the system parameters, then the underlying radially symmetric steady state is unstable with respect to time-dependent perturbations. (For smaller delays, this steady state is stable). Using the delay as a measure of the speed with which a tumor adapts to changes in its structure, we infer that, for the second case, a highly responsive tumor (small delay) has a better chance of surviving than does a less-responsive tumor (large delay). We also conclude that the tumor's evolution depends crucially on the manner and speed with which it adapts to changes in its surroundings and composition.", "score": 0.10331318974861985, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:0b9bbefc-e2a5-41c0-8dbf-f2376ce3b2c3>", "text": "Joshua E. Elias, PhD\nStanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, California\nA great deal of cancer research focuses on investigating the methods by which tumors cope with damage to their DNA. Less is known about the ways cancer cells deal with damage to any of the thousands of proteins necessary for cell survival. Cancerous cells often occupy environments that subject them to numerous stresses, including oxygen and nutrient depletion, which can lead to protein damage or misfolding. To survive and proliferate in these conditions, cancer cells use specific protective mechanisms to destroy or restore damaged proteins; in contrast, normal cells would die in such surroundings.\nCancer cells may, for example, activate degradation pathways to do away with dysfunctional proteins. Dr. Elias proposes that cancer cells may also promote long-term survival by dividing asymmetrically, thus producing one daughter cell free of damaged proteins. To test these ideas, he will measure the lifetimes of damaged proteins, model the processes cancer cells use to dispose of proteins, and investigate the ways by which these methods contribute to tumor formation. By understanding the mechanisms cancer cells depend on to escape death and promote growth, he hopes to discover new treatments and diagnostics, as well as ways to better target existing therapeutics to individual patients' cancers.\nBenjamin P. Tu, PhD\nUT Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, Texas\nDespite decades of research, how cell growth and proliferation are coordinated with the metabolism in a cell has remained a critical unresolved question. Understanding these specific mechanisms would address the long-standing question of how cells assess their metabolic and nutritional state to decide when to proliferate.\nDr. Tu has discovered a key mechanism by which carbon sources, such as glucose, signal cells to grow and divide; these studies were conducted in the model organism, baker's yeast. His goal is to investigate these mechanisms in mammalian cells and determine whether such mechanisms can be exploited to selectively kill rapidly proliferating cancer cells. He also aims to explore whether novel, unconventional metabolic strategies might be highly effective for the treatment of a variety of cancers.\nMatthew G.

Researchers at the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research (FNL) used multiple experimental techniques along with a computer simulation to understand how KRAS functions at the inner side of the cell membrane and discovered an unexpected, dominant orientation of the protein on the membrane.\nThe KRAS protein sits on the surface of the cell inner membrane. In the active state, KRAS “casts out” part of itself known as the G domain like a fly fisherman in search of partner proteins, like RAF kinase, to enable cell growth. Image by Rob Dimeo, Ph.D., director of NIST Center for Neutron Research.\nTheir work is part of the National Cancer Institute’s RAS Initiative, which is dedicated to learning as much as possible about RAS proteins because of their link to roughly one-third of all human cancers, with the goal of finding therapeutics to directly target cancer-causing mutant RAS proteins.\nContrary to previously published reports, the researchers found part of the KRAS protein (known as the G-domain) to be extended away from the cell membrane about 90 percent of the time. In this orientation, recruiting partner proteins is more feasible, and the protein acts like a fisherman’s lure, hoping for a bite.\nWhen a RAS protein recruits a partner protein, it causes a domino effect of molecular activations that make a cell divide. In cancer, RAS is mutated and stuck in an active state, leading to uncontrolled proliferation.\nCurrently, there are no effective ways to directly block this domino effect in mutated RAS proteins. This unfortunately means the proteins take a form in which there’s no way to stop them from setting off cell division.\nThis study has provided a deeper understanding of how the protein functions, which is essential for understanding the cascade of activations leading to cell division.

As we can see, the level of proliferation for meristematic cells, when treated with a 1:20 diluted solution of apple juice, was half the control values, and their division almost stopped in the roots with a 50% delay in mass growth (EC50).\nAs we know, plants grow due to two main processes, cell division and extension. Like all eukaryotes, plant cells enter the cell cycle in response to external mitogenic stimuli. This process is regulated by a large number of compounds, such as phytohormones, ARGOS proteins, CLE peptides, transcription factors, cyclins, and cyclin-dependent protein kinases. Decreased cell proliferation during stress or after treatment with abscisic acid may result from activated expression of genes that encode protein inhibitors of cyclin-dependent protein kinases, ICK/KRP. However, the mechanisms that control differentiation can function independently of the cell cycle . It appears that the subchronic amounts of apple juice triggered similar processes in our study and, therefore, the inhibition of cell proliferation did not significantly affect the growth in root mass.\nThe percentage of chromosomal aberrations in dividing cells in relation to total stained cells was quite low, about 0.4%, both in the control and the test samples treated with 1:20 and 1:10 diluted juice. We found no effect dependent on the amount. Neither could we determine this indicator in the test samples treated with a higher concentration of juice (1:5 and 1:2 dilution) due to the absence of dividing cells.\nThe abnormalities detected in both the control and the test samples included the adhesion of chromosomes to each other, their leading during anaphase, as well as disorganization and disordered separation during metaphase and anaphase. However, these abnormalities were not distributed evenly among the samples. For example, aberrations (Fig. 3) and anaphase leading were almost ten times as high in the test samples.

These two populations are then incubated together, generally for around 5-6 days. After the initial incubation, Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) is added to each mixture, and is incorporated into the DNA of the proliferating cells while they are incubated for an additional 12-24 hours. Finally, the BrdU is washed out of the mixture and an Enzyme-linked Immunosorbant Assay (ELISA) is performed to quantify the amount of BrdU as a measure for cell proliferation. In the end, you are evaluating the proliferation response of the target cells that occurs when you mix the two populations of lymphocytes.\nTwo-way MLR- A two-way MLR differs from a one-way MLR in that both of the cell populations are able to proliferate. As both cell populations are able to proliferate, the specific experimental design must take this into account. The analysis for the amount of cell proliferation again utilizes BrdU incorporation into DNA with a subsequent BrdU-specific ELISA.\nIn a nutshell, MLR’s are pretty much what they sound like; mixing populations of lymphocytes together, and measuring the reaction that occurs. In a one-way MLR, only one lymphocyte population can respond or proliferate. In a two-way MLR, both populations can proliferate.

By the 8th century BCE, the Greeks had adopted the alphabet from the Phoenicians. Because vowels were more phonetically significant in Greek than in Phoenician, the meaning of five unused consonantal signs shifted to represent five of these vowel-sounds.8 The Greek alphabet was therefore the first to graphically represent both consonantal and vowel sounds, and thus this often considered the first true alphabet.\nRoman writing developed from a mixture of Etruscan and western Greek alphabets around the 5th century BCE. By the 3rd century BCE, this alphabet comprised 21 of the 26 letters we currently use. The last five letters, j, u, w, y, and z, were added over the following centuries. The modern English alphabet was not fixed until the advent large-scale publishing in the 19th century.9 [image: alphabetevolution.jpg]\nThe alphabet was derived from earlier, non-phonetic graphic systems. According to I.J. Gelb in A Study of Writing there were three ways in which the first logograms (in scripts like Sumerian and Egyptian Hieroglyphics) created meaning. The first type of logogram suggests a concrete object or action simply by means of a visual resemblance. The second operates through association. That is, a picture of a circle with lines radiating outward might not only mean ‘sun’, but also ‘bright’ or ‘day’. A third class of signs represented concepts with geometric forms (such as marks for documenting numerical value).10\nThe development that bridged non-phonetic to phonetic writing systems was the rebus.

This Proto-Sinaitic script is often considered the first alphabetic writing system, where unique symbols stood for single consonants (vowels were omitted). Written from right to left and spread by Phoenician maritime merchants who occupied part of modern Lebanon, Syria and Israel, this consonantal alphabet—also known as an abjad—consisted of 22 symbols simple enough for ordinary traders to learn and draw, making its use much more accessible and widespread.\nBy the 8th century B.C., the Phoenician alphabet had spread to Greece, where it was refined and enhanced to record the Greek language. Some Phoenician characters were kept, and others were removed, but the paramount innovation was the use of letters to represent vowels. Many scholars believe it was this addition—which allowed text to be read and pronounced without ambiguity—that marked the creation of the first “true” alphabet.\nThe Greek language was originally written from right to left, but eventually changed to boustrophedon (literally, turning like oxen)—where the direction of writing alternated with every line. By the 5th century B.C., the direction had settled into the pattern we use today, from left tor right. Over time, the Greek alphabet gave rise to several other alphabets, including Latin, which spread across Europe, and Cyrillic, the precursor of the modern Russian alphabet.", "score": 0.825166643, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:374ea157-8e21-4211-b53b-978e18b8c199>", "text": "|Date||V (401 - 500)|\n|Origin and Provenance||\nOrigin uncertain.

The object is what the representamen stands for. The third, and perhaps the most vulnerable to change, is the interpretant which is what appears in the mind of the person decoding the representamen. Representamens, objects and interpretants exist in a complex, dynamic relationship that becomes even more complex when applied to the ancient script of hieroglyphics. When applying Peirce’s terms to hieroglyphics, it becomes clear why translation is difficult and why the medium has changed over time. Even the most basic unit of Peirce’s triad, objects, may have changed over a five-thousand year span so that hieroglyphics are describing objects that do not exist anymore. Peirce’s concept of representamen poses a particular challenge to media theorists and linguists within hieroglyphics because of the complex amalgamation of word and image, icon and sign. And therein lies the crux of this medium – with no firm translation of hieroglyphic representamens, we are incapable of developing accurate interpretants from hieroglyphics. The medium preserves a mystery as our imaginations run wild with exaggerated interpretants. Even though linguists are making progress at decoding hieroglyphic representamen, the fact that the script was considered indecipherable for over fourteen centuries contributes to the overall mystery of this medium (Cottrell, p. 14).\nTo understand what distinguishes Egyptian hieroglyphic script from other ancient systems of writing, it would be helpful to compare hieroglyphics with Greek and Latin. Although Egyptian civilization flourished for five times as long as ancient Greece or Rome, the language became indecipherable for over fourteen hundred years. Conversely, Greek and Latin continued throughout history to be used and understood by the academic community. Greek and Latin can be found in numerous places, especially ancient and modern texts. Most ancient hieratic script (hieroglyphic’s everyday, cursive form) became lost because of its transcription on papyrus and ostraca.

The\nlanguage of ancient Egypt was hieroglyphic, which survived through\nthe ages.

Mitchell defines the imagetext as a mutually antagonistic struggle between the word and image to convey meaning. In writing, words function as a “visible language” that can convey meaning both discursively and pictorially. For example, words can operate as arbitrary signs that require the reader to assign meaning. Words can also operate as artistic aesthetic images themselves. Hieroglyphics is an ancient Egyptian script and a premier example of a medium that combines word and image to convey meaning. Hieroglyphic script constantly switches between icon and symbol to complicate the word/image relationship. At times, characters function as icons that represent the objects they depict. At other times, characters function as arbitrary signs, requiring the reader to assign phonetic value. The amalgamation of word and image not only makes the translation of hieroglyphics difficult, but also raises interesting questions about the characteristics of this medium. It can function archeologically, providing records of ancient Egyptian life. It can function phonetically to help linguists assemble conjectured patterns of speech. Or, its ancient symbols can simply represent esoteric art that resists translation in order to preserve the mystery of the medium.\nHieroglyphic script may be divided into three categories – logograms, phonograms and determinatives (Davies, p. 102 – 105). The simplest form of hieroglyphic writing is the logogram, which is an iconic sign of the object it represents. Examples of Egyptian logograms:\nLogograms can represent not only the exact object they depict, but also extensions of that image. For example, the logogram of a sun may represent the actual object of the sun, or the concept of day. The drawbacks of a pictorial writing system quickly become apparent as iconic signs fail to represent complex concepts. Logograms are sometimes used as arbitrary characters with no correlation to the object they depict. Called phonograms, these arbitrary signs convey meaning phonetically. For example, you can convert the visual images of “bee” and “leaf” into their phonetic value to create a final visual image of the word “belief.” Hieroglyphics combine phonograms and logograms to complicate the word/image relationship. In addition, hieroglyphic script uses determinatives to assist in translation. Located at the end of words, determinatives help to clarify remnants of ambiguity.", "score": 0.10044210763538639, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:9d953776-6931-490f-945e-4a6302dfd239>", "text": "Using Mitchell’s idea of nesting, or mediums existing within other mediums regardless of linear relation, we begin to see how the medium of hieroglyphics nests within a larger medium of our history’s greatest religious monuments. Hieroglyphic’s location on religious monuments contributes to the aesthetic nature of the medium and detracts from its previous usage as an everyday language. While 6,000 hieroglyphics have been documented thus far, Egyptologists surmise that fewer than 1,000 of these were used with regularity. Most of the hieroglyphics that we study today were probably reserved for formal religious ceremonies and not frequently used in ancient Egyptian writing. (Davies, p. 83). If hieroglyphics were discovered in the same type of media as Greek and Latin, namely academic textual sources, hieroglyphics may have developed a much different course throughout history as a multi-faceted language – not just a “sacred writing.”\nIn Understanding Media, Marshall McLuhan describes his hallmark concept, “The medium is the message.” A great example of McLuhan’s trademark phrase, hieroglyphics is a dead language that no longer communicates meaning through its signs. The signs become the message, as each indecipherable symbol becomes a piece of art that represents mystery, magic and ancient Egypt itself. Today, the uses of the term hieroglyphics have expanded beyond its traditional usage to define ancient Egyptian script. It’s used as an adjective to describe writing that is hard to decipher. It’s also used as a noun to describe a symbol with a secret meaning (in the form hieroglyph) OED. As the word assumes these expanded definitions its frequent usage will perpetuate a shroud of mystery around hieroglyphic script. Even if the ancient script were deciphered word-for-word with complete accuracy, the medium is likely to retain an association with mystery, a mystical afterlife, and magical powers. Books and movies use ancient Egyptian settings, especially tombs, as trademark backdrops for mummies and mysteries, and adventures in history. Museums develop elaborate exhibitions on ancient Egypt, using special effects that contribute to an esoteric, ancient culture.

No matter what the skeptics or the debunkers have to say, but there is hardly any doubt that alien life does exist and they have been visiting out planet since the ancient times. A study on the ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics would confirm this further. Here is some of the best hieroglyphic evidence that points towards the existence of alien life.\n(1) The Temple of Seti I at Abydos has a hieroglyphic panel that bears symbols resembling the helicopter, spaceship and fighter jet planes. These hieroglyphic panels were made three to five thousand years ago, when man had no idea about these modern day vehicles.\n(2) An Egyptian woman is seen sitting with an alien looking being in her laps in one of the hieroglyphic panels that has been recovered. Human structures can be easily made out in other hieroglyphic hence it is obvious that the being in question is certainly not human, but an alien.\n(3) Many hieroglyphs bear images of humans with extra elongated craniums. As naturally human cranium is not supposed to be that long, it is believed by the alien enthusiasts that ancient Egyptians tried ropes on the skulls of their babies to make the cranium look elongated. This was a measure to emulate the appearances of the aliens is what is widely believed.\n(4) A flying saucer is seen in one of the hieroglyphic panels that are found on the walls of ancient Egyptian monuments. The shape and structure of the alleged flying saucer is so accurate, that someone might think that the ancient Egyptians had referred to a sci-fi movie to draw that.

These beings have large black eyes and look humanoid, but certainly they are far from being humans.\n(6) There is another hieroglyph that is found in the Temple of the Pharaohs where an alien is found that resembles exactly the little grey men about whom we keep on reading in the various tales of alien encounters.\n(7) Another work of hieroglyphic art depicts a flying object that is emitting some rays pointed towards an animal.", "score": 0.002390724643471483, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:19db25ea-fb8c-4ba0-aeac-c89075a9af25>", "text": "|Languages||Demotic (Egyptian language)|\n|c. 650 BC–5th century AD|\nDemotic (from Ancient Greek: δημοτικός dēmotikós, \"popular\") is the ancient Egyptian script derived from northern forms of hieratic used in the Nile Delta, and the stage of the Egyptian language written in this script, following Late Egyptian and preceding Coptic.

I'm hoping to experience something far from the cliches and sign up for a Graffiti Mundo tour to explore the street art of the city's northern suburbs.\nLed by Marina Charles, an English expatriate living in Argentina, we begin our tour in the leafy suburb of Palermo Viejo. While graffiti is often scorned as the domain of degenerates and delinquents, it's quite the opposite in the artistic neighbourhoods of the Argentinean capital. \"The walls are for the people here\", Marina tells us. It's not uncommon for a graffiti artist to leave an email address on artwork and have prints available in local galleries.\nOur first stop is Calle Conde 391, where we see a 20-metre mural splashed across a wall facing a suburban street. The graffiti was completed by an artist using fluorescent paint with mambo-esque images of living cactuses, angels and seahorses. Many graffiti exhibits in the city were painted as a response to the crippling economic crisis of 2001, showing that even when times are tough there is room for beauty, no matter how simple.\nWe see a gigantic, floating zeppelin-whale painted on the side of a TV production agency's wall on the corner of Calle Zapiola. Gualicho, a local artist, was commissioned to liven up the corner and, with whales, a startled deer making spaghetti and cartoonish characters blobbing along the wall, it changes the block from a drab grey edifice to a stream of consciousness-style exhibition.\nAt the next set of paintings, local graffiti artist Fede Minuchin joins us and offers to show some of his work. He tells me graffiti art is not a clandestine activity. He often works in the middle of the day on busy street corners rather than by moonlight, with a balaclava and head-torch.\nOur next stop is the exterior of an old power station, which stretches for 100 metres.

I liked it, I felt it complicated but I thought I could do something with it.\nWhat relationship did the country have with that era of the beginnings of graffiti?\nIn those early years, art represented a manifestation of freedom in Argentina. After the events of the 70s and early 80s, in which there was a strong repression by the military governments and in which people who thought differently would “disappear”, this feeling of going out into the streets was accentuated. This helped in making the graffiti scene in Argentina less prone to being repressed, painting was seen as an activity of freedom. In Argentina people are more concerned about knowing why you do it and who pays you than wondering if it is legal or not. In Buenos Aires in particular, that constant to occupy spaces naturally began to occur, either through demonstrations with people on the streets or artistically speaking. It is a city that gives you the possibility to experiment, the pedestrian is a very participative person, they always want to talk to you and intervene in what you are doing, he is extremely curious and the results when you paint are immediate.\nWhat were your influences at the time?\nA lot of people used to come from Europe to Buenos Aires. We got together to see European graffiti books and magazines. Somehow this politically and economically colonial relationship between Argentina, mostly Latin America, with Europe meant that what we consumed was European graffiti and hip hop, which at the same time was drinking from the American. Sometimes we weren’t able to understand what people form Europe were doing: we were trying to do good letterings and in Europe they were making lines, shapes… As we progressed we understood the way the street artwork was carried out in Europe, it went beyond letters.\nHow does your work and career evolve to make the leap to a more professional environment?\nBy the early 2000s I had an alternative job in marketing, none of us lived out of painting.

These are messages, prompts to conscience and historical resonators directed more at locals than visitors.\nThere is so much wall art in Buenos Aires that movements have emerged, galleries are dedicated to it, photos of it have been collected in large format books and some of the artists have become celebrities feted by the mainstream art world.\nIn the small Appetite gallery in the suburb of San Telmo you can see the distinctive cartoon-like work Gualicho (aka Pablo Harymbat) whose colourful murals and “neo-graffiti” have appeared all over this city and in other Latin American countries, and latterly in galleries.", "score": 0.845811665, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:806c9033-badb-4f26-b767-ae109d1e7769>", "text": "That’s why I think that Eduardo Kobra is the greatest graffiti artist in the world.

Bogotá is nothing like you’ve ever seen before. First it’s a big city, counting close to 9 millions habitants. It is also considered to be the fastest growing city in South America. For years, during the dark years of Colombia and the drug war, Bogotá was quite of a dangerous city. And that reputation stuck to the name.\nUnfortunately, a lot of people don’t know the good about Bogotá. The city is culturally rich. It’s home to many museums (my fav is the gold Museum), Universities, Libraries and events which gave it the nickname of « The Athens of South America ». It also kept its old town pretty intact with many painted house fronts and a feel of two centuries ago.\nMore recently (the last decade or so), Bogotá became an open sky museum and art gallery. Since spray painting on walls has been decriminalised, it opened the door to self expression from local artists. Bogotá started to get noticed and many international artists make a stop there to paint a wall, often covered soon after by other artists. Painting over and over again to practice and master the art.\nWalking around the city was quite of an experience. Spotting amazing murals at every corner. It even got overwhelming because of so much talent all over town. Today, for some people, Bogotá a new reputation. It’s not attached to violence to them but to creativity, colors and self-expression.

Walking around Buenos Aires' Palermo Soho district, with its abundance of murals, you'll soon understand why this saying has been adopted by a group of local street artists.\nAround here, the street art differs from that found in most other parts of the city. You won't find so many tags and bombs (which rival gangs or crews traditionally use to mark their territory) or political graffiti; the designs tend to be more creative, thoughtful and intricate – and use visual messages rather than words or slogans. After all, this is one of the city's trendiest districts, much frequented by tourists drawn to its designer clothes shops, cafés, restaurants, bars and nightclubs.\nMany of the artworks are also of extremely high quality, which is hardly surprising when you learn that a large number of the local artists have backgrounds as illustrators and graphic designers.\nIt's lunchtime and I've arranged to meet up with a friend in Plaza Serrano to show him some of the nearby graffiti hot spots.

Their brightly coloured clothes painted over a stone grate draw attention away from their pallid faces, seemingly reflecting the elaborate designs in the fashionable boutiques just around the corner.

Even being one vegan and one vegetarian we managed to find plenty of choice to satisfy our hunger, and washed our meal down with a delicious bottle of Argentinian Malbec.\nFor my latest photos of my trip, have a look at my Instagram feed by clicking here.\nYou can also visit my website www.torgoestravellingagain.com for more blog posts about my latest trip, UK vanlife tales and general backpacker travel tips.", "score": 0.0001726232282448256, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:2b404bc5-35cb-4642-a595-22e03d495efe>", "text": "There are no specific laws banning graffiti in the capitol, unless it is contains ethnic or racial slurs, ABC News producer Joe Goldman in Buenos Aires reported.\n\"One could paint a wall of a police station without having any problem in Buenos Aires,\" Goldman added.\nIndeed, Marton Otonelo, a spokesman for the Argentine Director General's Office in Buenos Aires, told ABC News, \"There are two types of street art: political and artistic. Both are good. They are part of the city. ... Street art doesn't bother us.\"\nThere are even now local businesses who employ the artists to adorn their shop fronts.\nA rumor persists about a local politician, dogged by political graffiti, who employed the services of one of the more respected local artists to paint the front of his house. Such is the respect that artists have for each other's work, it has even acted as an effective deterrent against further vandalism.\nGrafitti's Origins and Modern History\nThe beginnings of the graffiti and street art movement have been traced to the mid- to late-1960s in New York City, although there is evidence that it may have begun in Philadelphia at about the same time. Urban historians say the movement emerged from two factions -- political activists looking for a forum and street gangs staking territory.\nThe word graffiti comes from the Italian graffiato, which means scratched. It refers to work that is written, using words or symbols, and as a result, grafitti artists often are referred to as \"writers.\"\nThroughout its recent history, there have been strong arguments that graffiti is simply vandalism, an unwanted sullying of walls and public places; urban visual noise, at best.\nThe most common form, and the most reviled, is known as \"tagging.\" A writer quickly scrawls his name, or moniker, on whatever outdoor, or publicly visible surface he can find, avoiding detection by the authorities in the process -- a quick-in, quick-out blitzkrieg of bus shelters, railway stations and billboards, leaving little time for artistic expression.\nOne particular individual known as Tox has been tagging on London's transport network for over nine years, usually eluding the London Transport Police and causing hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of damage, much to the frustration of London underground employees, such as Andy Hogg.\n\"Anyone that commutes on our trains quite regularly, I think, will have seen 'Tox,'\" Hogg said on a Sky Travel documentary viewable on YouTube.", "score": 0.00014125592952304758, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:51bce6fe-fc65-432f-b328-b65bae3dbb3f>", "text": "Berlin’s tumultuous history offers inspiration for street artists to produce some of their best work. Nowhere is this more apparent than the East Side Gallery, a section of the former Berlin Wall that has been turned into a 1.3-kilometre canvas. Here, you’ll find 105 murals that were painted on the east side of the wall in 1990, where graffiti had been banned during Soviet rule. Kreuzberg is another popular district for street art, and is home to the largest stencil in the world, the Kreuzberg Spaceman. But you don’t have to travel far from downtown Berlin for impressive creations: the central Mitte district is a creative enclave, home to Tacheles, a former department store covered in artists’ work.\nOne of the most popular tourist areas in Buenos Aires, Caminito, is a district that bills itself as the world’s first open-air pedestrian museum. Its colourful building facades are very photogenic, and a number of artists sell their wares in the neighbourhood. However, Buenos Aires is known worldwide for its support of street art. Barren walls city-wide are transformed into building-sized murals, which are not only tolerated by the city government, but oftentimes actively funded. Buenos Aires native Martin Ron’s famous 3D turtle is found here, in addition to a number of his other vibrant and breathtaking murals.\nAs a burgeoning artistic centre, Philadelphia boasts a creative spirit that’s easy to find on its “Mural Mile”. Surprisingly, Philadelphia’s Mural Arts Program – the largest public art program in the United States – began as part of a government-funded anti-graffiti movement. Tired of the artless tags that plagued the city, Philadelphia officials approached graffiti artists and had them direct their considerable artistic talents into full size murals. Today, there are more than 3,600 of these impressive works dotting the city. In addition to these full-size pieces, a number of famous street artists have left their mark here.\nMelbourne has become one of the world centres for street art, with dozens of acclaimed artists having left their mark on the city. Numerous alleyways in the Australian cultural capital are decorated with vibrant works. Hosier Lane and Caledonian Lane are iconic spots, and in 2010 the local council commissioned a number of artists to paint the walls of Union Lane.", "score": 0.00012339472310907265, "source": "sparse"}]}

Among these, your rights in the criminal justice system are among the most important. Anyone accused of a crime needs to have certain rights so justice can be served, whether they are innocent or guilty. But what happens if your constitutional rights are violated? Ultimately it depends on which rights are violated. This guide will explain what happens in this situation and what your rights are. If you suspect your rights have been violated, make sure you tell your attorney as soon as possible.\nFirst things first, there are certain human rights that everyone always has. These include:\n- The right to food and water while incarcerated\n- The right to a safe environment while incarcerated\n- The right to contact loved ones while incarcerated\n- The right to medical treatment while incarcerated\n- The right to have support during interrogations\n- The right to have an interpreter present during interrogations\nOn top of these human rights which must never be denied, there is something called the Miranda warning. This lays out four basic rights that everyone has after being arrested. You are probably already at least partially familiar with the Miranda warning, if not in name, as it is very commonly portrayed in television and movies.\nThe Miranda warning is a right in and of itself. Everyone has the right to have the Miranda warning read to them upon being arrested. Further, the Miranda warning states that you have the right not to say anything, the right to know anything you do say is on the record, and the right to a public defender.\nIf Your Rights Are Violated\nWhat happens when a right is violated depends on which right is violated. If a basic human right is violated, that may be grounds to have the case dismissed. Your criminal defense lawyer in Bloomington, Illinois will know the best way to leverage it to make that possibility as likely as possible.\nIf you were not read the Miranda warning, or not read it right away, then anything you might have said was not on the record until the Miranda warning was read to you.

I’m a pretty easy-going guy and understand that businesses, on occasion will get it wrong, but what IS important is how an organisation aims to fix things\nOn occasion I have been absolutely infuriated, usually as a result of bad decision upon bad decision upon bad decision by those in charge. The most recent example of this was when I visited ZIZZI’s (A place I have regularly eaten in and been happy with for over a decade). I was with my business coach at 7pm and they informed me that, despite the restaurant being 75% empty, they wouldn’t be able to give me a table. And in this financial climate, absolutely crazy . I filmed the restaurant and put it on twitter, to discover others had had similar bad experiences in different venues so something is going on there nationally . I didn’t receive a single reply or apology from the organisation.\n2) How much does the likely redress have to be before you will\ncomplain and why?\nPretty bad. I realise that everyone is human and mistakes happen.

For plants they are useful for\n- Fixing the plant firmly to the soil,\n- Provide water,\n- Provide minerals and manures,\n- Storage of food,\n- Excretion of waste,\n- Supports the life of other organisms.\n- Source of food\n- Provides vital medicine and drugs,\n- Source of fiber,\n- Help in Plant propagation,\nPlant fixation: Plants are the organisms which do not move in their lifetime. They grow and die in the same place where they are born. This ability to stay at one place is due to their root system. These roots fix the plants and trees firmly in the ground.\nHence, the main uses of roots to plants is the firm fixation in the soil. Even heavy winds, flood, tsunamis would be unable to uproot the plants. Such is the strength of roots in fixing the whole plant in soil.\nProvide water: The second major uses of roots to plants include water supply. Plants require a continuous supply of water. This is necessary to move the sap in the plant from root to the stem, branches and leaves at the top. The water helps to manage the body temperature of the plant, support cellular respiration, photosynthesis etc. This water is supplied by the roots system from the soil. The soil water is present as Plant available water. This water is taken up by roots through the capillary action.\nThe roots keep on growing through the entire life of the plant to different regions below the ground in search of water for the plant. So sometimes they grow to a few meters if needed.\nProvide minerals and manure. Besides water, roots also supply manures, minerals from the soil to the plants. These are essential for plant growth and physiology. Minerals include macro and microelements. Manures include ammonia, nitrogen, etc.\nStorage of food: Some plants have storage roots in which the plants store their food materials. These include carrot, radish, beet root, turnip, onion, ground nut etc.\nThis food is meant for future consumption by the same plant. But animals and human can feed on these stored food roots.\nWaste expulsion: Roots also help to expel the waste from plant body. Accumulation of this waste could be toxic to the plant.", "score": 0.846792638, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:b2f9298a-e19a-49d1-abbe-03821122669a>", "text": "Enhancing plant health and vigor, and minimizing stress.\nEnhanced seedling growth.\nEnhanced rooting of cuttings.\nEnhanced plant transplant establishment.\nImproved phytoremediation of petroleum and heavy metal contaminated sites.\nMycorrhiza enhances Drought Resistance\nMycorrhizal Plants in Revegetaion site\nAdvantages of Mycorrhiza:\nProduce more stress resistant plants during production and for landscape.\nPotentially less pesticide usage.\nPlants are more drought and nutrient tolerant in the landscape.\nPotentially higher transplanting success and faster establishment.\nValue added: Marketing landscape plants with greater stress tolerance.\nAll of these \"better\" beg the question, \"better than what?\". For example, if you add mycorrhyzal fungi to a sterile medium, compared to just using a sterile medium without inoculant. But most of the time we're growing in the soil, not sterile and hopefully we use soil that is organically rich. What about a disturbed soil, with or without, say, organic enrichment, that encourages any native or local mycelium? or in a generally good soil that is not so disturbed? I have not found much that really tells me, scientifically, that adding mycorrhiza will be of great benefit. Testimonials and photos are not the best evidence.\nEven so, I want to give my plants the best chance I can, so I don't mind a little \"spicing it up\" with something that seems, at least, not harmful and may have some benefit.

I have a few tips to help your leafy friends grow bigger, better, and stronger. Not to mention, help you become an intuitive and confident plant parent!\n01. Light, light, light!\nAll plants love light, but not all plants love the same amount of light.\nHaving an adequate light source is the most crucial factor in powering plant growth.\nPlants vary in the amount of light needed; some are shade-loving, and others love the sun. As the seasons change, so will our plants’ needs. During the winter, the Northern Hemisphere leans away from the sun giving us fewer hours of daylight and weaker rays of sunshine.\nTo work out the types of light levels you have, observe how the sun passes through your room and how that changes during the day. Keep in mind, levels of light in a typical home vary depending on the placement of doors, windows, and window treatments.\nIf your plant is starting to look spindly or you see it bending towards the light source, this may be an indicator it’s not receiving enough light. If possible, bring your plants closer to the window, and every few days, gradually rotate them to help them even out.\n02. Water Your Plants, Not Too Much\nJust like light, all plants need water. It’s important to remember there are many factors that affect how much you water and how often you water. For example, high temperatures and high light levels increase the plants’ need for water; while, less light and cold temperatures reduce the plants’ need for water.\nHere are a few easy tips to help you become a watering pro:\n- Instead of watering on a set schedule, judge if its time to water based on the soil condition. Has the soil dried out since the last time you watered? If so, its time to go again\n- Never water when the soil is still wet! Overwatering is the number one reason plants do not make it\n- Each time you water, water your plants thoroughly. This means watering the soil evenly and until water runs through the drain hole. DO NOT let that plant sit in a puddle of water after. This can cause major root rot and suffocate your plants’ roots.\n- Water plants with room-temperature water.", "score": 0.843383133, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:068ea7d1-c2ee-42f8-950b-7551807ee2d4>", "text": "What is the function of a root:\n- Absorption of water and nutrients through the root hairs.\n- Anchoring the plant into the soil to support it.\n- Storage of food and nutrients.\n- Synthesis of specific components (nicotine).\n- Primary root, not dominant, the whole root is a system of fibres and branches.\n- Lateral roots.\n- Root hairs.\n- Root tip.\n- Root cap.\nTypes of root:\n- Primary root with lateral roots (Geranium).\n- Taproot (Carrot).\n- Fibrous root (Leek).\n- Tuber (Potatoes).\n- Aerial roots(Ivy).\n- Tuberous root (Dahlia).\n- Haustoria root (Mistletoe).\n- Runners or Stolons (Strawberry) - Stolons are horizontal stems that run above ground and produce new clone plants spaced at various intervals.\nTrue Bulbs - Daffodil, Tulips, Hyacinth, Snowdrop.

Lilies do not have a papery skin and therefore dry out faster and are more easily bruised.\n- They are more or less rounded and narrow to a point on the top.\n- They have a flat part called a basal plate at the bottom. The roots grow from the basal plate as well as the shoots and scales.\n- True bulbs have new bulbs (offsets which form from the basal plate).\n- They are made up of rings called 'scales', which are modified leaves that store food.\n- True bulbs add rings each year from the inside, outside rings are used up.\nA number of causes can be to blame for daffodil blindness;\nDry situation: In a dry place, or in drought conditions, daffodils may die down prematurely. After flowering, growth should normally continue for several weeks, allowing food reserves in the bulb to be replenished before the following season's flower buds are formed. If growth stops prematurely the bulb may, due to lack of food reserves, fail to form a flower bud.\nDefoliation: Leaves removed soon after flowering by mowing or when tidying up the garden can lead to blindness. As with dryness it prevents the bulb building up food reserves for the future.\nKnotting: Gardeners often tidy up clumps of daffodils after flowering by drawing the leaves together into a knot.", "score": 0.843369424, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:bc7d6908-0dfc-4df0-afdf-d9bb5e815ede>", "text": "And tell me about your experiences with plant medicine in the comments below!", "score": 0.842788219, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:4bc8039e-8692-49e0-994d-3c181e27555a>", "text": "Hi Nico, Thanks so much for the time you put into answering questions; and the amount of detail you go into when doing so.

DWC, or deep-water culture, grow systems are known for growing big plants with large yields as they offer excellent aeration for the root zone. In these systems, the plants sit in baskets or netted pots that drop down into larger buckets. The roots dangle down into these buckets, which periodically flood with water and nutrients, allowing the roots to sap up the H2O and nutrients the plants needs for growth.

The terms in AAAAB etc....well, when you take the fifth powers, these all have a fifth root of unity stuck to them. (Try it if you don't believe me.) There are twenty terms...five of them have a multiplier of w, five of them w^2, etc. You know the sum of the fifth roots of unity is -1; so when you add all twenty terms together, you get:\n-(AAAAB + BBBBC +.....+ CCCCA +...etc)\nwhich is also symmetric, so you throw them away.\nAnd the same thing happens whith the third and sixth terms. But the terms I've marked off are a little different. For them, you get all the terms with with a multiplier of a fifth roots of unity: but you also get real terms. You collect the terms with the fifth roots, and they add up to a negative term...the other terms add up positive.

Remember, there were 120 possible Lagrange resolvents based on the order you choose the roots of the fifth: but when you take fifth powers, this reduces to 24 different ones because some of them are just rotations of others.

And actually, they have a much easier time doing that, than they thought they would. So, they thought people would be like no, I’m not going to give you my gun.

This is the remarkable finding of Jonathan Romain's latest book, which reveals the enormous growth in religious conversion that is becoming a widespread phenomenon throughout the country.\nSupposedly godless Britain is in fact teeming with peiokw who are either converting from one faith to another or are adopting a faith for the first time in their lives. In what appears to be an astonishing religious merry-go-round, Christianity, Buddhism, Hindiusm, Islam, Judaism and Sikhism are all losing adherents and gaining new members.\nWhat is it that has led to this explosion of religious change? How can the same religion both attract and repel at the same time? How does conversion affect the lives of the individuals concerned? What are the long-term consequences for the faiths themselves?\nThis pioneering study is based on years of research by Jonathan Romain, who both charts this startling new trend in Britain today and tells the story of the many converts and their families whose lives have been so dramatically changed. Anyone who is interested in the development of religion or in the major currents affecting British life today will find this book both exciting and challenging.\nJonathan A.

Some would describe Chambers as an evangelical mystic. He has become most well-known through books of his teachings that were compiled and published by his wife after his death. His most well-known book is the devotional classic My Utmost for His Highest.\nOswald Chambers was born in 1874 in Aberdeen, Scotland, the son of a Baptist pastor. When he was 15, his family moved to London. There, he and his father went to hear Charles Spurgeon preach. Oswald was touched by the message, and, while walking home, he and his father stopped under a street lamp and Oswald gave his heart and life to Christ.\nOswald grew as a believer and became involved in ministry to the poor, but he was a gifted artist and felt that God’s call for his life was in art. He attended the Royal College of Art in London and then the University of Edinburgh, Scotland. Although he enjoyed his studies, he was not content. Some friends suggested that he should enter the ministry, but he did not feel called and said that God would have to make it very clear if he was supposed to change course. Soon, his income from freelance illustrations dried up, and he began to experience financial hardship. One night he decided to spend the whole night in prayer, wrestling with God, to find direction. In the morning he felt called to ministry, and in the morning mail, he received a brochure for the Dunoon Theological Training College. Chambers left an internationally recognized and prestigious university to attend a Bible college with thirty students and one faculty member because that is what he thought God wanted him to do. The reaction of his friends was mixed.\nAt Dunoon, the students lived and studied in the home of the principal, Rev. Duncan MacGregor, who was a mentor to the students as well as a teacher. MacGregor brought guest speakers and teachers to the school, and Chambers was especially touched by the teaching of F. B. Meyer who spoke about the necessity of being filled with the power of the Holy Spirit. Oswald felt that was missing in his life.", "score": 0.823008, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:53ef6cf2-d9f9-4e62-a4a9-25b8851919a3>", "text": "how old was henry vii when martin luther was born\nHenry VII of England was 26 years, 9 months and 13 days old when Martin Luther was born.\nSay hello to Evi\nEvi is our best selling mobile app that can answer questions about books, music, films, conversions, history, people, places and much more.\nTo experience the full power of Evi you can download her app for free on iOS, Android and Kindle Fire.", "score": 0.820872128, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:94ad1f43-ff1e-4839-9d9a-9c9e8767ca78>", "text": "A.B.

Converted in his teen years under the ministry of Charles Haddon Spurgeon, he studied art and archaeology at the University of Edinburgh before answering a call from God to the Christian ministry. He then studied theology at Dunoon College. From 1906-1910 he conducted an itinerant Bible-teaching ministry in the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan.\nIn 1910, Chambers married Gertrude Hobbs. They had one daughter, Kathleen.\nIn 1911 he founded and became principal of the Bible Training College in Clapham, London, where he lectured until the school was closed in 1915 because of World War I. In October 1915 he sailed for Zeitoun, Egypt (near Cairo), where he ministered to troops from Australia and New Zealand as a YMCA chaplain. He died there November 15, 1917, following surgery for a ruptured appendix.\nAlthough Oswald Chambers wrote only one book, Baffled to Fight Better, more than thirty titles bear his name. With this one exception, published works were compiled by Mrs. Chambers, a court stenographer, from her verbatim shorthand notes of his messages taken during their seven years of marriage. For half a century following her husband's death she labored to give his words to the world.\nMy Utmost For His Highest, his best-known book, has been continuously in print in the United States since 1935 and remains in the top ten titles of the religious book bestseller list with millions of copies in print. It has become a Christian classic.\nAbsolutely no flaming! These daily threads are intended to be devotional in nature.

The turning point in how I read Scripture wasn’t a crisis though—not really. Rather, this change happened because Jesus became the center of everything for me.\nAs I share in my new book Out of Sorts, it was as my discipleship to the man from Nazareth unfolded over the years that I began to realize Jesus himself is the Word of God (John 1), and so I needed to learn to read my whole Bible through the lens of Jesus Christ. Oswald Chambers, writing about centering our lives on Jesus, said, “We are not asked to believe the Bible, but to believe the One whom the Bible reveals.” Jesus himself put it this way as he responded to religious leaders who challenged him: “You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about me, yet you refuse to come to me to have life” (John 5:39–40, NIV).\nA New Approach\nWhen I was a child, I remember asking a Sunday school teacher if God had been “born again” between the Old and New Testament. I thought maybe that was why, to me, God seemed to change from the ancient stories of war and tribalism in the Old Testament to the Jesus I knew and loved—the God of lavish love spoken of so fervently by John, the bridegroom to a yearning bride, the one who had only to say “Follow me” for people to drop everything and run after him. In my childish reasoning, I thought that perhaps God had also experienced transformation like the rest of us.1", "score": 0.012840305667251306, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:01f2c7d9-3388-4326-9878-d4770cb866fc>", "text": "OSWALK Hall in Ayrshire, an outstanding classical mansion with superb Robert Adam interiors, is on the market for offers over £1 million through leading Scottish property consultants CKD Galbraith, together with Knight Frank.\nThe mansion is the main house of the Auchincruive Estate which is situated in wooded countryside on the River Ayr, on the outskirts of the county town of Ayr.

It’s true that the 2016 election has been unprecedented in American history, for a number of reasons. But it is part of a historical continuum. Not long ago, particularly after watching PBS Frontline‘s wonderful documentary “The Choice,” profiling the lives of both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, I began thinking about the kind of people who become President of the United States and the various paths that their lives take to reach that point. There are plenty of historical theories out there on what makes Presidents and presidential candidates, but in this post I want to offer my own, as a historian, for whatever it may be worth.\nI posit that Presidents and major-party Presidential nominees fall into three basic categories: “Strivers,” “Opportunists” and “Party Hacks.” These titles are not intended to be pejorative, just descriptive. You can’t tell which category a person falls into without looking at the totality of their lives and circumstances in historical context. Also, it can be difficult to tell between the categories in some instances. To some degree, which category a candidate falls into, and which one their opponent falls into, probably does have a significant impact on the outcome of the election, as I’ll describe. This analysis considers only major-party nominees, not third-party also-rans, failed primary challengers or joke candidates. It’s not a perfect system, but I think there’s something to it.\n1. Party Hacks\nWhat I call the Party Hack is a person whose occupation is politics, and whose loyalty and service to a major political party happens to position them to achieve the Presidency. A Party Hack is a loyalist, an apparatchik, who has most likely spent his entire adult life in politics and who usually becomes a presidential contender when it’s “his time.” Usually a Party Hack’s resume will include legislative offices at multiple levels, and also some executive and administrative offices.

As Instagram account parkdalelife has put it: “Prince, Madonna, Cher, Loga. Legends don’t need last names.” Loga is unaware of his social media fan following, thanks to Instagram and the combined star power of Matty Matheson and Eddie Huang. I show him an Instagram video clip of a Huang’s World episode in which Loga’s Corner is profiled. Laughing heartily, he says he isn’t on Instagram but that he remembers Eddie Huang coming to film the episode. We talk about momos, the neighbourhood’s diversity, the growing Tibetan community, and cowboy movies. Like many older Tibetan men, Loga loves Westerns. I always figured it must be the horses and cowboy boots. His favourite movie is Ringo and His Golden Pistol, a 1966 spaghetti western also known as Johnny Oro. Loga immigrated to Canada in 2012 from India, and with his entire family chipping in, built a beloved Parkdale institution in two years.

Over those same 12 years, the Los Angeles Dodgers did not win a single playoff series. This past season, Torre departed New York to coach the Dodgers. The result? The Dodgers won their first post-season series in 20 years, while the Yankees missed the playoffs altogether.\nAsk Yankees and Dodgers fans, and they will tell you that Joe Torre’s leadership matters. However, they may not be able to tell you exactly why Joe Torre is an excellent leader. What’s true of the fans in New York and Los Angeles is true for many of us. We experience the effects of leadership without understanding the cause.\nIn this article, I hope to make plain why the best leaders are the best leaders. In a nutshell, remarkable leaders give their best to their people, and get the best from their people. Let’s look at how this happens.\nThe Best Leaders Give Their Best to Their People By…\nPeople naturally follow leaders they respect as being more advanced than they are. For this reason, personal growth is directly proportional to influence. If you desire to gain followers, then pay the price of getting better.\nTo give people your best, you have to elevate your leadership capacity. Consider the metaphor of walking up a narrow staircase – you can only go as fast as the person in front of you. When leaders stop growing, they quit climbing and impede the progress of everyone following them. However, when leaders grow, they ascend the stairs and create space for those behind them to climb higher.\nPersonal growth involves challenging yourself, and pushing beyond the realm of comfort. When is the last time you did something for the first time? How long has it been since you felt in over your head?\n“Only a life lived for others is a life worthwhile.”\n~ Albert Einstein\nServing others is an attitude issue. Unfortunately, many leaders operate under a king-of-the-hill mentality. They attempt to pull down anyone above them in order to secure the top spot for themselves. In doing so, they clutch at power, grapple for control of company resources, and strive to dominate others. Seeing relationships as win-lose propositions, they ultimately burn bridges and isolate themselves.\nThe best leaders take an entirely different approach.", "score": 0.824721277, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:68a9d085-b5ad-4c6b-81e8-5b10bdb947af>", "text": "But there's no question his teams would have failed to enjoy the same success if it wasn't for his ability to handle difficult players like Dennis Rodman and to bring individuals together as a team.\nAccording to Michael Jordan, Jackson successfully melded different styles and talents, and fostered harmony among teammates. Recognizing that each athlete possesses unique emotional, mental and spiritual attributes, Jackson's success relies on taking a holistic approach to managing his players.\nApplying it to work: Treat your subordinates as distinct, complex individuals and try to recognize the root of behaviors that you wish to encourage or discourage.\nJoe Torre, Major League Baseball CoachWhat he's done: Torre is a New York icon.

However, he was an adept run producer throughout his career, driving in 100 or more eight times and totaling 1,424 RBI. His .857 OPS makes him one of the greatest hitting shortstops in baseball history.\nInterestingly, while he was putting together a Hall of Fame playing career, Cronin also managed the Senators from 1933-1934, as well as the Red Sox from 1935-1947. As a manager, he tallied a record of 1,236-1,055, proving to be successful both in and out of the dugout.\nFollowing his retirement in 1945, he managed for two more seasons before transitioning into the Boston front office. He became the general manager, and served in that capacity until 1959.\nContinuing his trend of constant involvement in baseball, he immediately moved onto his next role in the game, becoming the president of the American League in 1959. Cronin would be the first former player to be elected to such a post within the league. He would occupy that position until 1973, finally retiring from the game after nearly 50 years of continual involvement.\nA career-long member of the Detroit Tigers, Hall of Fame second baseman Charlie Gehringer played from 1924-1942.\nThe 1937 AL MVP was a career .320 hitter, with an .884 OPS, collecting 2,839 career hits and 1,427 RBI over his 19 seasons.

Torre’s sense of strategy was often trivialized, his job little more than filling out their glittering lineup card.\nYet it’s no coincidence that they took on their manager’s National League ethos. Though they will always be known by their ancient handle, the Bronx Bombers were way more Cardinals, moving runners, playing pristine defense, and a conga line of golden arms on the mound.\nFor all their success, those dynastic Yankees had just one player hit 30 home runs while winning four World Series in five years. True to Torre’s personal and professional approach, those Yankees were best known for making the enemy bleed a slow drip – taking pitches, extending innings, and making those pay who gave them an extra out.\nTorre was often regarded more as gatekeeper than general, his job was simply to stroke the epic egos dotting his dugout. But in the nouveaux sports climate of sensitivity and social media, being a referee is an enormous asset. His singular talent was keeping those stars aligned.\nManager of the New York Yankees is unlike any job in sports, a gig that requires a rack for all the hats he must wear. Despite his historic success, he was never truly appreciated, even by yours truly, who joined the angry chorus in 2004 calling for his vocational head after blowing that 3-0 lead in the ALCS. It feels rather foolish in retrospect. Only neurotic New Yorkers (like me) could find fault with six pennants in eight years, a run not seen since Casey Stengel and not even approached since.\nIt ended poorly, as it must with George Steinbrenner, with Torre rejecting an incentive-laden contract in 2007 and his protege, Joe Girardi, assuming the helm. Some remember Torre not for the four rings but rather the heartbreaking losses in 2001 and ’04.\nBefore joining WFAN/CBS I interviewed Torre for amNew York. One of his most indelible memories was having a fan tell him “You’ll do better next year” right after losing Game 7 of the World Series in the ninth inning. Despite his Brooklyn heritage, Torre never understood why fans would consider such a season a failure.\nFor those of us who made you feel that way, I apologize, Joe.", "score": 0.821317255, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:eba34b70-1e3c-4de2-a274-f2055fc71008>", "text": "Even if Torre never manages another game, he’s been one of the finest managers in baseball history. His 2,067 victories rank eighth among all managers all-time. Torre took the Yankees to the playoffs during all twelve of his seasons at the helm.

His 1,173-767 record with the Yankees, a .605 winning percentage, is a standard of excellence any successor would be hard-pressed to match.\nThat winning percentage improved to .613 in the postseason, but mostly on the back of his record from 1996-2000, a period that included four World Series titles in five years. The Yankees have won just four postseason games since losing to the Red Sox in the 2004 ALCS.\nSpeculation over Torre’s successor will be intense in the coming days. Two in-house candidates, bench coach Don Mattingly and former Marlins’ skipper and current YES announcer Joe Girardi, figure to get a shot, while fashionable outside names like Tony La Russa and even former Mets manager Bobby Valentine have also been floated.\nOver the past week, the Steinbrenners took their time—excruciatingly–deciding the fate of the manager’s job.

We've called two young physicians in training to hear their views in just a few minutes.\nBut first, we want to talk about a different malady, March Madness, when 65 teams begin battling it out on the hard courts to win the NCAA Men's and Women's Basketball Championships. Already this year's tournament looks very different with some perennial powerhouses shut out of the competition.\nTo hear more, we are joined by our regular sports contributor Pablo Torre. He's a sports writer for Sports Illustrated magazine. Welcome back. Thanks for joining us.\nMr. PABLO TORRE (Sports Writer, Sports Illustrated): Hey, Michel.\nMARTIN: So, it's been an atypical we're going to talk about the men first, no particular reason. Just, you know, talk about the men first. It's been an atypical year in college basketball for the men. These big names like UCLA, UConn and UNC are not in the tournament, and in place, big teams like Wofford, North Texas and Robert Morris. What's up with that?\nMr. TORRE: Yes. I mean, every March Madness season there are these teams that no one's heard of. That's not the real surprise. But you're absolutely right. Not having UNC, which won the tournament last year in Detroit, the national championship game; not having UCLA, maybe no story program in college basketball; not having UConn, which looked like a powerhouse midway through the season is surprising.\nAnd so, yeah, there is a little bit of education that needs to go on with college basketball fan and all the amateur gamblers that'll be coming out of the woodwork this week. And, yeah, there's a little bit of homework you got to do, a couple of smart picks. But, yeah, you can no longer rely on picking those old, historic big names so much anymore.\nMARTIN: I'm going to ask you for the smart picks in a minute.

Modesty does not come in pinstripes.\nOne thing in particular that the Bronx Bombers are good at is myth making. The organization has more legends - real and imagined - than perhaps any other professional sports team. From announcers to managers to players, myth making in New York is part of the job description.\nOn Saturday, Joe Torre attempted to add to Roger Clemens' real legend with what, if you're being generous, could be called hype. If you're being realistic, it's called propaganda. Pinstripe propaganda. More myth.\nAsked to explain his team's recent run of success during one of Fox baseball's \"informative\" in-game interviews, Torre used the opportunity to blandish the Rocket. In short, Torre's thinking went, Clemens is the reason the Yankees have turned things around this month. Which, of course, is exactly what Clemens wants people to think. Too bad it's not true.\nIf Torre were being honest he could've offered a much simpler explanation for the Yankees' 14-6 record in June prior to Saturday's game against the San Francisco Giants: weak competition.\nAside from the Red Sox, whom the Yankees took two of three from to start the month, the combined monthly record for Yankee opponents in June is 46-71, good for a .393 winning percentage. Overall, those teams (the White Sox, Pirates, Diamondbacks, Mets, Rockies, and Giants) are a combined 209-225 for the season, good for a .481 winning percentage. In other words, the teams the Yankees have played during their win streak are either (a) not very good (the White Sox, Pirates, and Giants) or (b) they are slumping (the Mets).\nSure, the Mets are battling for first place in the NL East, but they headed into the Yankees series riding a four-game losing streak and having lost 10 of 12. The Yankees beat a slumping team.\nOr consider the Rockies, the one hot team the Yankees have played since ripping off nine straight wins. Colorado came into the Yankees series having won 10 of 15 and continued their winning ways by sweeping the Evil Empire, who had previously won 10 of 12.", "score": 0.005807146988317724, "source": "sparse"}]}

I can recall lending books to someone only to have the person return my books to me three years later. I've also loaned books out and NEVER gotten them back.

I knew about a few titles, but at last count Cat was up to 30 titles. Which, needless to say, has created a very long “to read” list for me.\nCat and I got talking about just how many titles there are and what their availability is like, when it dawned on me – “You’re a librarian Kath! You know how to access books!”\nLet’s face it, books are expensive to buy. Plus they take up space, have environmental impact and it’s not always necessary to keep them or read them again. So being able to borrow them from the library is a fantastic exercise in accessibility. Now I don’t know about your local library, but mine is free to join, you can borrow up to 20 items at any given time, can request books from other branches of our library service for a small fee, can have most items for four weeks AND has over 3 million items in the collection. Not to mention that there are multiple languages available, resources for people with disabilities and a whole bunch of other services you can take up. That does vary from library service to library service, but whichever way you go, it’s still a budget way to read all these great titles.\nOne of the things Cat and I have been talking about is the concept of having fat studies titles in a library collection as an alternative voice to the usual diet books and “you can lose weight too” pop psychology/self help books.\nNow I know we have Health at Every Size by Linda Bacon PhD in our collection. If I take the Dweey number (Dewey is the classification by subject matter) of just that title alone, 613.25, and search our catalogue, I come up with 256 titles. All of them, except Health at Every Size, are diet books. So to one fat-friendly title, I get 255 weight loss/diet books, just in our collection alone.\nWhen I search the Dewey of Kate Harding and Marianne Kirby’s book Screw Inner Beauty (US title: Lessons from the Fatosphere), 616.398, I bring up 19 titles, 17 of those are weight loss/diet help guides or titles about the “obesity epidemic”.

SupremEX® Metal Matrix Composites (MMCs), which are made of high-strength aluminum alloys that are reinforced with nano-to-micron sized ceramic particles, offer a unique combination of properties that provide advantages in body in white (BIW) and other structural automotive applications, including chassis, suspension and braking components. They combine the lightweight properties of aluminum with outstanding strength and stiffness. With enhanced isotropic modulus and strength, SupremeEX composites can reduce chassis weight by 20 – 25 percent -- without sacrificing performance or rider safety. These MMCs offer excellent fatigue performance, the ability to withstand impact damage and improved damping of vibration which ensures good handling and a smoother ride. SupremEX products can be used to replace aluminum, titanium, steel, carbon fiber and other structural alloys and composites. LIGHTWEIGHT WITH HIGH STRENGTH & STIFFNESS While auto manufacturers have used aluminum extrusions and carbon fiber and other materials to save weight, SupremEX composites offer advantages over both types of materials. SupremEX composites are available in several grades with different metal to reinforcement ratios and combinations of physical and mechanical properties to meet application requirements. SUPREMEX 620XF EXTRUSIONS FOR BIW SupremEX 620XF is a conventional 6061B alloy that is reinforced with 20 percent ultra-fine (0.7 mm) SiC ceramic. This metal composite can be extruded into complex sections using standard precision extrusion facilities and tool steel dies. The high specific stiffness and strength of 620XF offers design advantages for BIW applications. Extruded sections made from SupremEX 620XF have a similar bending modulus to the equivalent titanium section combined with the weight of aluminum. By utilizing the improved stiffness of 620XF compared with conventional aluminum alloys it is possible to produce chassis with either improved torsional stiffness or reduced weight. SupremEX 620XF can be joined using a range of standard techniques including; cold metal transfer (CMT) welding, adhesive bonding, friction welding and rivets, self-piercing rivets (SPR), self-pierce & clinch (SPAC) nuts.", "score": 0.82205224, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:fb9ba536-b40d-4f04-88c4-88cd3a851290>", "text": "A versatile and easy to use materials tester, the twin-column OmniTest is available in 10 kN, 25 kN and 50 kN capacities.\nControlled by VectorPro MT, Mecmesin's newly developed materials testing software designed for use in QC and R&D laboratories.\nLower capacity models of 5 kN and 7.5 kN are available in the OmniTest single-column range.\nGot a question about this system?

This 100% recyclable and almost infinitely available raw material is not just lighter and less costly than aluminium or carbon, but also has practically the same strength properties as conventional materials. This new quality of basalt fibre, which is to be utilised in the construction of rotors for large-scale wind power plants in the future, can now be put to systematic use in the automotive industry. This type of basalt fibre therefore has the potential for becoming a main structural element and thus being used as a future lightweight material in cars for the high volume market.\nThe body concept of the “Light Car – Open Source” is based on a rolling chassis – a genuine, universal platform to which the modules for various bodies can be added.

Bushings are made of rubber which separates the faces of two objects while allowing a certain amount of movement. As a car moves over tough or bumpy surfaces, this movement allows the suspension parts to move easily. The rubber which is flexible in nature helps to minimize transmission of noise and small vibrations through to the chassis of the vehicle.\nMaterials Used and its Effect\nBushings are made through hot-bonded construction where elastic material is melted to the inner and outer metal sleeves. Another method used for producing bushings is whereby the elastomer or rubber material is injected in the sleeves. Polyurethane or synthetic rubber does not bond to metal; it remains suspended on the mount surface which allows a greater range of motion.\nThe rubber material is placed around a small metal cylinder that allows for a small bolt to pass through it. As rubber wears out over time as a result of heat and frequent movement, it is advisable to check bushings regularly for damages to prevent failure.\nFunctions of Bushings\nBushings press in control arms at each end of the device to secure the connection to the chassis. The control arm is the device that connects suspension system to the chassis of the vehicle. Control arm bushing is used to hold the bolt in place that connects the control arm to the chassis. They are located at the broad end of the control arm to which the part pivots.\nEffects of Bushings\nThey are installed at the front and rear suspensions of vehicles which helps to maintain proper alignment while driving. This is achieved even on off road and under extreme weather conditions. The presence of control arm bushing in the suspension system enhances navigation and safety features of the vehicle. As a result, there is an overall improvement in handling, cornering and control. This also enhances driving experience as it provides smooth operations.\nInstalling high quality bushings lightens up handling which hastens navigation. In a car’s suspension, three or four control arms are installed between the rear axle housing and the frame to carry the brake torque. Control arms are used to save weight and add adjustability which enhances suspension performance. Therefore installing quality bushings complements these functions and makes it easy to maneuver uneven road surfaces or when driving in extreme weather conditions.\nControlled Wheel Hop\nAnother benefit of bushings is that they are useful in controlling wheel hop which also improves cornering control.", "score": 0.032050657510971525, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:af0f2e85-deeb-49ad-89f6-f80f8ec42cd6>", "text": "Official Dealer of KPI/JCI, Roadtec Pavers, and custom Goodfellow chassis and conveyors.Equipment Rental Bucket Crusher, Equipment Rental Bucket Crusher Stone Crushing Machine: equipment rental bucket crusher - We provide customers with a variety of good quality construction and mining crushing equipment, and optimize the combination of various types of equipment to meet different process needs. ...Xcentric Crusher Buckets | Excavator Attachments, Xcentric Crusher Buckets are a type of high-performance excavator equipment for crushing both wet and dry materials right on the jobsite.

Tea was first introduced to Portuguese priests and merchants in China during the 16th century. Historians believe that tea originated from southwest China as a medicinal drink during the Shang dynasty - there are records of medical text dating back to 3rd century of tea drinking for medicinal purposes, written by Hua Tuo. During the 17th Century, drinking tea became popular in Britain, and the British introduced tea production to India, in order to compete with the monopoly on tea in China.\nTea preparation Tingqua (1809-1870) source from: Bonhams\nTea Production in China\nThis rare export painting depicting the various stages involved in the production and preparation of tea, with plantations in the background, the middle ground with figures storing tea into crates and carrying packed tea, the foreground with men sampling tea and binding crates and women sorting leaves, the large doorway inscribed 'Specialising in Various types of Renowned Teas', the flanking columns with banners inscribed 'For One Investment You Receive 10,000 in Return', and 'Unity Leads to Harmony'.\nDifferent Types of Chinese Tea\nThere are many different types of tea classifications in China; according to the different degree of fermentation, tea can be divided into non-fermented tea, semi-fermented tea, fully-fermented tea; The six types of teas are green tea, black tea, oolong tea, yellow tea, white tea and dark tea; re-processing tea, namely, scented tea, condensed tea, extracted tea, medicinal tea, fruit tea and tea food. Among them, six teas and scented tea are the most common tea.\nGreen tea is non-fermented tea, made from Camellia sinensis leaves. What makes Green Tea different to Oolong and black tea is that Green Tea has not gone through the same withering and oxidation process. The number of Green Tea's varieties ranks the highest of China’s six basic teas. The quality of green tea is influenced not only by tea varieties and environmental impact but also by tea processing. The different varieties are slightly different in the early manufacturing process, but in overall, the steps to make green tea include fixation, rolling and drying.", "score": 0.852782428, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:8f12ee2f-685a-4ef8-aa67-8728d975a28f>", "text": "Life In Teacup gives free tea samples - Earliest 2010 green tea arrived!\nGingko, what’s the difference between your “modern” style green Tie Guan Yin and ¥our “traditional” style green Tie Guan Yin?\nI once wrote a blog about 3 styles in Tie Guan Yin.

People of the Han Dynasty used tea as medicine (though the first use of tea as a stimulant is unknown). China is considered to have the earliest records of tea consumption, with records dating back to the 10th century BC. Lucky, no one can challenge this!\n• Laozi (ca. 600-517 BC), the classical Chinese philosopher, described tea as “the froth of the liquid jade” and named it an indispensable ingredient to the elixir of life. Legend describes Lao was saddened by society’s moral decay and, sensing that the end of the dynasty was near, journeyed westward to the unsettled territories, never to be seen again. While passing along the nation’s border, he was offered tea by a customs inspector named Yin Hsi. Yin Hsi encouraged him to compile his teachings into a single book so that future generations might benefit from his wisdom. This then became known as the Dao De Jing, a collection of Laozi’s sayings. To honor Yin’s generosity and its effect on the book’s creation, a national custom of offering tea to guests began in China.\n• During the Song Dynasty (960-1279), production and preparation of all tea changed. The tea of Song included many loose-leaf styles (to preserve the delicate character favored by court society), but a new powdered form of tea emerged. Steaming tea leaves was the primary process used for centuries in the preparation of tea. After the transition from compressed tea to the powdered form, the production of tea for trade and distribution changed once again.

This is the origin of today’s loose teas and the practice of brewed tea.\n• In 1391, the Ming court issued a decree that only loose tea would be accepted as a “tribute.” As a result, loose tea production increased and processing techniques advanced.

The answer is simple: the way it was planted, grown, and brewed contributes to a good tasting tea.\nEven if that’s the case, the origin of tea is not just the same because of the plant. The long history and influence of tea started in China.\nCultural Influence and History of Tea\nFor every country, tea is served with a different flavour in a different manner. This only means that the best tea in the world by country is actually different.\nDiscovered in China around 30th Century BC – 21st Century BC, tea has become part of China’s daily customs. There are several stories on how the tea was discovered. However, the most popular amongst them is the one with Emperor Shen Nung and his soldiers.\nIt is said that they’re taking some rest under a tree while boiling some water. After a while, the wind blew and some leaves fall in the boiling water. Since then, tea has become one of the well-loved drink not only in China but in the rest of the world.\nTea is served differently in every country.\nIn Japan, for instance, tea is not just a simple beverage. The country even has “The Japanese Tea Ceremony” where a lady wearing kimono will be the one serving the tea with a ritual that dates back to more than a hundred years ago.\nAlthough the Chinese way is quite similar to the Japanese, serving tea is greater than any other drinks in China because it’s considered as a way to communicate with other people.", "score": 0.836705089, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:e70c47f0-7131-41d5-bcfe-b25ba91212fc>", "text": "Taiwan Formal Small Pot Ceremony\nThis ceremony is based on traditional Chinese Gong-Fu (literally “making tea with skill”) dating back over 400 years to the Ming Dynasty. 40 years ago Grand Master Tsai of the Lu-Yu Tea Culture Institute realized that Gong-Fu brewing was headed for extinction as Taiwan society modernized.

It took years for the ordinary Russians to get cheaper tea.\nIn the following centuries, tea became very appealing to the Russians, and they developed their own unique traditions surrounding this drink.\nWhen my son returned from Russia after his graduation, he brought a peculiar looking utensil, which we later reckoned a “Samovar” – an urn that developed from the Mongolian cooking stove.\nA little pot of black tea is brewed very strong and placed on the top of the samovar to keep it warm. The Russians have always traditionally brewed their tea with a samovar. When the tea is served, a cup is half filled with strong tea, watered down with hot water drawn from the tap in the side of the samovar and drunk with sugar or jam.\n(Pic above) Tea Custom of Russia – The pot is designed to sit one atop the other, with the bottom pot holding the hot water. A pot with thick black tea is kept on the top. This keeps the tea warm and makes it easier to dilute to suit one’s taste from the hot water readily available.\nWORLD-TEA-CUSTOMS - UNITED STATES OF AMERICA\nWhile coffee is by far more popular, hot brewed black tea is enjoyed both with meals and as refreshment by much of the population.

Tea was first introduced to Portuguese priests and merchants in China during the 16th century. Drinking tea became popular in Britain during the 17th century.

From there, the drink spread to Sichuan, and it is believed that there \"for the first time, people began to boil tea leaves for consumption into a concentrated liquid without the addition of other leaves or herbs, thereby using tea as a bitter yet stimulating drink, rather than as a medicinal concoction.\"", "score": 0.18772595772625406, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:bef5de41-9b30-4f53-8a1e-f667923c64db>", "text": "For the gastronomical and spiritual enjoyment of the tea,\nwe must thank the Tea Saint, Lu Yu, who living between A.D. 733 and\n804, almost single-handedly wrote his monumental book \"Classic on Tea\"\nperfected and perpetuated tea drinking.

During these tea ceremonies, they would have tea-tastings. At these events, they evaluated the best quality teas.\nAs they underwent these tastings, they also changed the process of making tea. Instead of boiling tea, they began to whip it. With this method powdered tea is added to hot water, which is then whipped with a fine bamboo whisk. This method was developed in the Song dynasty. Whipping tea was easier and more convenient than boiling, and brought drinking tea into greater prominence in mainstream society.\nBuddhism spread from China to Korea, and with it, tea spread as well. Similarly, around the year 805 the Japanese Monk Saicho went to China to study Buddhism. He traveled from Japan to Guoqing Temple at Mount Tiantai in Zhejiang Province.

Five years later, when the plants reached maturity, Abbot Eichu served the green tea to Emperor Saga.

The name says it all: gaiwan translates literally into \"lid-bowl.\"\nMany tea historians believe that the gaiwan evolved from the chawan, or “tea bowl,” which has been used in China since the Tang Dynasty (618-907). The famous tea expert and writer Lu Yu, author of The Classic of Tea, is credited with creating the chawan, which became widely popular during the Tang Dynasty. The use of chawan eventually spread to Japan, where it is still used in the traditional Japanese matcha tea ceremony. However, the gaiwan did not develop from the chawan and become widely used in China until the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644).\nThe popularity of the gaiwan mirrors the evolution of tea itself. It took several hundred years for the chawan to evolve into the gaiwan because loose tea leaves did not become popular until the Ming Dynasty. Before the Ming Dynasty, most tea in China came in various powdered forms. Although the quality of these powdered teas was likely questionable, this easily transportable form was essential to the spread of tea and tea culture.\nIn China, loose tea leaves finally came into fashion during the Ming Dynasty when the Imperial Court created a law dictating that only high quality, loose leaf tea could be offered as gifts to the emperor. The general population began to drink this type of tea as well. Eventually, the older tea brewing methods and utensils used with powdered tea fell out of favor.\nThe modern tea brewing technique was created after this shift towards whole leaf tea. Tea was brewed by pouring hot water over the leaves inside of a vessel. A strainer of some sort was needed to remove the steeped tea leaves. The modern teapot and gaiwan were created.\nThe gaiwan was originally intended to be used for drinking tea. When drinking from a gaiwan, you simply bring the cup to your lips and use the lid to prevent the leaves from entering your mouth.\nIn the modern day, gaiwans are often used as a brewing vessel, with the decanted tea being served in a separate cup.

Reading this history will ground you in the physically and spiritually nourishing benefits you’ll find with matcha!\nOrigins of Matcha\nThe earliest records of matcha green tea date back to the Chinese Tang Dynasty between the 7th to 10th centuries A.D. Tea harvesters during the Tang Dynasty were looking for ways to grow their businesses, hoping to make it easier to transport and trade their goods. In doing so they changed their traditional method of tea preparation to instead roast and pulverize the tea leaves into a powder form. They would then mix it with water and salt to create a “brick” of tea that was easier to carry and haul, especially across Chinese trade lines.\nThe following era of the Song Dynasty, from the 10th to 13th centuries, was when matcha tea became more widely accepted and utilized. Harvesters were utilizing a powdered form of tea to make it easy to trade and consume. More Chinese homemakers were adopting this tea into their daily routines.\nThe powdered green tea form also became incredibly popular among Buddhist monks for spiritual practices and natural homeopathic remedies. This would prove important for the spread of matcha to Japan (and later to the west).\nMatcha Goes to Japan\nEisai, a highly regarded monk from 12th century Japan, was the first to truly bring matcha to the Japanese. After a majority of his life studying Zen (“Chan”) Buddhism in China, he returned home with customs and goods to share. After becoming a certified practitioner in China, he wanted to bring back the teachings to his home country.\nIn 1191, Eisai packed up the Zen Buddhist scriptures and the green tea seeds he gathered while leaving in China. When he returned home to Japan, he began replicating the production of powdered green tea he’d learn from the Buddhist monks.\nEisai was a strong believer in the use of tea as an herbal and medicinal tonic.

These early compasses were made from lodestone which is a naturally magnetized iron ore.\nThese devices were later used for navigation during the 11th Century Song Dynasty. Lodestone was replaced with iron needles that were magnetized by striking with some lodestone.\nAs with other Chinese inventions, the compass would later be adopted by other cultures as they made contact via trade.

It is such a mixture of structure and surprise, formality and freedom.\nThe topiary is underplanted with blocks of colour and the winter bedding was about to be taken out and replaced with verbenas, double daisies and antirrhinums for summer.\nIt was the first time I have been there so early in the year, and we picked a perfect two days when the beech leaves were out, still soft, and bright, bright green, and the topiary still sharp from winter. The sun was brilliant and we sat outside while the south of England was grey and damp - that was another first for me because it can rain in Cumbria like nowhere else, hence the number of fantastic gardens there.\nBefore breakfast we walked in the Park, once a medieval deer park (modernised around 1700!), along the great avenue of oaks and where the river Kent wends its way.

It has an excellent cafe too.

The Bruggeman (BG) formula is used to study the complex permittivity of SnO2 NWs/paraffin composites at microwave frequencies. The real and imaginary parts of the complex permittivity increase with the volume concentration of SnO2 NWs, showing a distinct increase at around 30 vol. % due to semiconductor-insulator transition at the percolation threshold. The BG equation is noted to be more suitable for qualitative analyses and may introduce errors in quantitative analyses due to the large aspect ratio of SnO2 NWs. The study highlights the potential for tuning absorption frequency by altering SnO2 NWs content for achieving wideband absorption.", "score": 2.3948822021484375, "source": "basic", "doc_IDs": ["<urn:uuid:9b5be7c1-b347-4120-9f06-9035c7e2330e>", "<urn:uuid:ad24c62b-8cec-4c43-bde8-1f8df190cc90>", "<urn:uuid:4648fddd-4625-47a8-a524-31a8edbe9244>", "<urn:uuid:40a8140f-5afe-4fcd-8e3f-62ff5d3c8d9a>"]}], "retrieved_chunks": [{"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:4648fddd-4625-47a8-a524-31a8edbe9244>", "text": "With the increase of proportion in the nanocomposites, the matching frequency tends to shift to the lower frequency region, and similar results have been gained on CNTs [1,2] and ZnO NWs . Fan et al. pointed out that with an increase of CNT content in composite, the electric field of short-distance resonance multipoles leads to dominance of reflection property rather than absorption property. They reported that ε increase with increasing CNT concentration, resulting in a shift of reflectivity peak toward lower frequency . The revelation is important because it suggests that the range of absorption frequency can be easily tuned by changing the SnO2 NWs content of composites. Thus, wideband absorption could be achieved by coupling SnO2 NWs/paraffin layers of different SnO2 NWs contents. So, it is of great significance to calculate real and imaginary part of complex permittivity at different loading proportion of SnO2 NWs.\nComposites consisting of metallic or semiconductor particles embedded in a dielectric matrix have been widely used and studied for years [20-22], but their physical properties are still not fully understood or unveiled. It would be extremely useful to predict the properties of composites once the properties of constituent components are known and extract the properties of constituents from the measured composite properties. If the composites are isotropic and homogeneous, this work could be done with EMTs. Classical EMTs are usually based on an equivalent dipole representation of the composite. The effective macroscopic EM properties of the composites are modeled on the effective dipole moments per unit volume, which is determined by the intrinsic dipole moment contributions of each constituent and their relative volume concentration . Among EMTs, the Bruggeman (BG) formula is the most commonly used. In this work, the complex permittivity ε of SnO2 NWs/paraffin composites at microwave frequencies has been studied in the framework of the BG formula.\nFrom formula (3), one can calculate Φe, Φm as follows:\nΦ is either of the real part and imaginary part of the complex permittivity ε and complex permeability μ.

As BG formula has difficulty in dealing with composite with percolation, we find that EMT can be only used in qualitative analyses, and leads to large error in quantitative analyses.\nIn conclusion, SnO2NWs have been prepared by a CVD method and their microwave absorption properties have been investigated in detail. Complex permittivity and permeability of the SnO2nanostructures and paraffin composites have been measured in a frequency range of 0.1–18 GHz, the value of both real part ε′ and imaginary part ε″ of the permittivity increase significantly with increasing SnO2NWs loading, and the variation curve of every content has the similar shape.", "score": 0.00038956433453569164, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:c2996035-493d-40c6-88d9-c18fae9db334>", "text": "Winegardner & Hammons, Inc. announces changes in company leadership\nChairman of the Board and CEO J.

These Dance Music-Lovers Have the Answer\nDoing good on the dancefloor.\nAnyone who’s been to a music festival knows the feeling of euphoria and unity that sweeps through the crowd. Unfortunately, this sense of positivity often evaporates as soon as you leave the festival gates.\nBut 10,000 HOURS, a foundation based in the Netherlands, believes the power of the dance floor can be a force for good. Launched six years ago, just after the recession hit, the organisation works with music festivals and world-class DJs to connect music fans with voluntary projects that can make a difference, hour by hour.\n“There’s a powerful feeling of unity at music festivals,” says co-founder of 10,000 HOURS, Nienke Basslé, who is a die-hard music lover. “We wanted to get this feeling and share it with the vulnerable people around us.”\nWhen the recession hit, Basslé noticed that the elderly and children with special needs were being hit hardest by government cuts.\n“They are weak and can’t speak up for themselves, so we thought, can we do something? Can we share the positive energy of the dance floor with these vulnerable people?” she asked. Joining forces with fellow music-lovers, they set themselves a challenge: “Can we donate 10,000 hours of community work to those vulnerable people?”\nThey partnered with festival Welcome to the Future for their first event, inviting fans to volunteer to plant trees and bake pancakes with the elderly. The demand was overwhelming, with more than 600 fans signing up to help out.\nSince then, the innovative project has encouraged music fans to donate more than 35,000 hours to vulnerable people in the Netherlands — and they aren’t prepared to stop there.\nThe impact of the initiative on individual lives is palpable. When DJ Nicky Romero visited a home for children with special needs, he gave one child a memory that will last a lifetime. Born a boy, Yuriko desires to be a girl and uses music to express the challenges she faces with her identity.

At the same time, a shift in communication methods, and giving culture means it is showing diminishing returns.\nCrowdfunding is an umbrella term for a relatively new method of raising capital from a variety of networks, expanding your donor base to fund ideas and projects. It allows a large number of people to contribute and support you, financially or otherwise, whether you’re working on social causes, product development, research and innovation, or a myriad other worthy initiatives.\nCrowdfunding allows word of your project to reach passionate investors that would have otherwise remained too far out of your network, or even your awareness. The impact of this can be huge.\nFor example, in 2015 a smartwatch company used crowdfunding to raise more than $20 million dollars from 80,000 people. The potential of crowdfunding is almost limitless, for the right campaign.\nHow does crowdfunding work?\nA campaign refers to a set project. For example, rebuilding a community after a natural disaster; the rehabilitation of rescued animals; providing education for a child, or a school for a set period of time; or covering medical expenses.\nEach campaign runs for a certain number of days, with a target goal amount. Companies reach out to their direct network (these are their first degree connections), both to raise funds, and to get their project pushed out to their connections’ connections (second degree connections).\nThis process progressively widens to span a huge network. The further the reach, the greater the impact.\nTypically, the most successful companies receive 25-40% of their revenue from 1st- to 3rd-degree connections. Once the project gains more awareness and attraction, other potential investors will start to support the campaign.\nWhat are the advantages of crowdfunding compared to traditional fundraising?\nRegardless of who you are, raising funds for new projects and ideas can be expensive and hard – even at the best of times.\nIt’s notoriously challenging to get a loan from the bank if you’re just getting started, or even securing capital from within your company to launch a pilot project. This is just part of the reason why crowdfunding might be a great tool for you.\nWhat are the different types of crowdfunding?", "score": 0.824560463, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:1b137fbe-9003-4147-8e18-9f9d1221f4a2>", "text": "Interdependent Definitely Excellent Activities Society\nThis has been keeping me up at night for a while now, in good ways.

Then, everyone works around it, tries different ideas. It is rare for us to have a precise idea of a final song before its creation. However, the album has an intentional unity. Nowadays, music is tending towards dematerialized format. Everybody can easily find and listen a band he likes on the internet. Nevertheless, in metal music, people mostly support the bands they like, and they seem to keep buying physical format, the one they prefer. The tape is certainly the most underground format. We are not especially pro-tape, but it has been a great opportunity for us to promote our album, so we took that chance.

To get an idea, here British Rock has inspired the local musical scene for a long time. I have been making music since 2003 and I realize that in recent years the city has improved a lot from creative initiatives in the field of art. Currently, the scene has diversified and electronic music is gaining momentum in a more alternative or track environment and we have countless events, independent labels and street parties, and so new artists are emerging.

Evaluate a significant experience, achievement, risk you have taken, or ethical dilemma you have faced and its impact on you.\n2. Discuss some issue of personal, local, national, or international concern and its importance to you.\n3. Indicate a person who has had a significant influence on you, and describe that influence.\n4. Describe a character in fiction, a historical figure, or a creative work (as in art, music, science, etc.) that has had an influence on you, and explain that influence.\n5.

The consortium’s next airliner, the A310 (entered service in 1983), introduced many new concepts, among them a two-pilot cockpit (in which the duties of a third crew member, the flight engineer, were performed by computers) and extensive use of composite materials for the airframe. Its third product, the A320 (1988), was the first subsonic commercial aircraft to be designed with fly-by-wire (electric rather than mechanical) primary controls and the first commercial aircraft to feature the so-called glass cockpit, which used electronic rather than mechanical displays. Through its innovations and the growing range of aircraft offered, the European consortium became the second largest maker of commercial aircraft worldwide, deferring only to Boeing while relegating McDonnell Douglas to a distant third place by the mid 1990s (prior to its merger with Boeing in 1997). Although Airbus aircraft used many American-manufactured components, the program gave a tremendous boost to European aircraft suppliers.\nEurope’s growing involvement in space activities provided another opportunity for international cooperation. In 1962 six western European countries and Australia signed a convention leading to the formation of the European Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO) to develop the experimental heavy-lift satellite launcher Europa, based on the British Blue Streak and French Coralie rockets. A parallel effort set the stage for the establishment of the European Space Research Organisation (ESRO), devoted to scientific space programs and the construction of satellites.

Coldbeck\nFull Text Available In the 1980's the British aircraft industry changed its approach to the management of projects from a system where a project office would manage a project and rely on a series of specialist departments to support them to a more process oriented method, using systems engineering models, whose most outwardly visible signs were the introduction of multidisciplinary product teams. One of the problems with the old method was that the individual departments often had different priorities and projects would get uneven support. The change in the system was only made possible for complex designs by the electronic distribution of data giving instantaneous access to all involved in the project. In 1997 the Defence and Aerospace Foresight Panel emphasised the need for a system engineering approach if British industry was to remain competitive. The Royal Academy of Engineering recognised that the change in working practices also changed what was required of a chartered engineer and redefined their requirements in 1997 .", "score": 0.81018275, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:d8e0a543-072b-438c-bb08-19e7c377a357>", "text": "The Airbus A380 has wings and engines manufactured in the UK.\nThe UK plays a leading part in the aerospace industry, with companies including Rolls-Royce playing a leading role in the aero-engine market; BAE Systems acting as Britain's largest and the Pentagon's sixth largest defence supplier, and large companies including GKN acting as major suppliers to the Airbus project.

The initial version of Ariane was first launched successfully on December 24, 1979, beginning a new era in Europe. To finance and operate the Ariane rocket and to commercialize space launch services with it, ESA set up Arianespace in March 1980 and gave it responsibility for operating the launch centre in Kourou, French Guiana. Its shareholders were 36 of the principal European aerospace firms, primarily those involved in actually building the rocket, as well as 13 major European bank groups and the French space agency CNES (Centre National d’Études Spatiales). Subsequently the Ariane series became the world’s most successful commercial expendable launch vehicles.\nSpacelab, the second major European program, was developed by German companies in cooperation with manufacturers from Italy, France, Britain, and six other European countries. Taken into Earth orbit in the payload bay of a space shuttle, the laboratory consisted of two separate segments: a pressurized 16-ton module in which astronauts could work and supervise experiments in a shirtsleeve environment and a pallet for external payloads. Spacelab made its maiden voyage in November 1983 and more than a dozen flights thereafter.\nFollowing the lead of the flagships of international cooperation—Airbus and Ariane—many other civil and military programs were established that involved two or more companies from different countries.

Due to low weight, good mechanical and electrical properties, magnesium is widely used for manufacturing of mobile phones, laptop computers, cameras, and other electronic components.\nHistorically, magnesium was one of the main aerospace construction metals and was used for German military aircraft as early as World War I and extensively for German aircraft in World War II. The Germans coined the name 'Elektron' for magnesium alloy which is still used today. Due to perceived hazards with magnesium parts in the event of fire, the application of magnesium in the commercial aerospace industry was generally restricted to engine related components. Currently the use of magnesium alloys in aerospace is increasing, mostly driven by the increasing importance of fuel economy and the need to reduce weight.

It is found in large deposits of magnesite, dolomite, and other minerals, and in mineral waters, where magnesium ion is soluble.

However the farmer noticed that the water seemed to heal scratches and rashes. The fame of Epsom salts spread.

It’s a term medical professionals use to describe an abnormal, sideways curvature of the spine. The curvature can range from minor to severe and doesn’t cause pain in most instances, but it does need to be monitored by a physical therapist who can determine if the curvature is getting worse and provide treatment if needed.\nThe human spine is a complicated construction that’s subject to a variety of conditions that disrupt normal formation, shape and alignment. Scoliosis is the most common, causing areas of the spine to form a C or S shape. In the severest forms, it can result in gait disruptions and disability.\nMinor curvatures often go unnoticed and many cases may be mistakenly attributed to poor posture or activities such as playing video games hunched in awkward positions. A physical therapist will look for signs they’ve been specially trained to identify that include one side of the body appearing to be tilted or “higher” than the other. Girls are more likely to develop scoliosis than their male counterparts.\nThere are three types of scoliosis. The first is infantile scoliosis that’s found in children from birth to 3 years and the second is juvenile scoliosis that appears between ages 3 to 9. Adolescent scoliosis is the most common, accounting for approximately 80 percent of all cases. It typically appears between 10 and 18 years of age during the rapid growth that accompanies adolescence.\nCongenital scoliosis is caused by a bone abnormality, while neuromuscular scoliosis is the result of a muscle or nerve condition and can accompany cerebral palsy and spina bifida. Degenerative scoliosis results from a traumatic injury or thinning of the bones. The most common type is idiopathic scoliosis that has no discernable cause.\nThe degree of curvature and whether or not it increases will determine the amount and types of physical therapy that will be needed. The rate of curvature may grow slowly, rapidly or stop and it’s the primary reason that youngsters must be monitored so closely. It’s never too early or too late to begin physical therapy and it can even be employed with infants.\nThere’s no way to determine the degree of curvature that will occur or who will develop scoliosis. Treatment and management plans are customized to the individual, factoring in the degree of curvature, the child’s age and when treatment commences.", "score": 0.845915794, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:78cba486-301a-4a4e-8308-5adaa67517a6>", "text": "AIS in girls accounts for about 90 percent of curves seen in clinical practice.\nScoliosis in Boys\nScoliosis can occur in boys at any age. In very small children, the “infantile idiopathic” form is actually more common in boys than girls. However, past that age, scoliosis is far more common in girls. In adolescence, girls are up to eight times more likely than boys to have a scoliosis. For reasons that are not known, the bigger the curve the more likely it is that it will be in a girl. Therefore, it is uncommon for a boy to have a scoliosis requiring treatment. Consequently, there have not been the same screening measures for boys in the past. Nevertheless, it is recommended that parents check their boys for scoliosis at least once. The recommended age to do this is 14.\nIn as much as approximately 90 percent of the patients seen in scoliosis clinics are adolescent girls with AIS, this website concerns this disorder and its management. However, the management of curves of other aetiology is generally along the same principles as those used in AIS.\nThe above remains a useful way of considering scoliosis. However, the following is a newer classification system:\nEARLY/LATE ONSET SCOLIOSIS\nIt is rare for children to develop scoliosis below the age of 10. Given that scoliosis is driven by growth, one occurring in younger children is more likely to need treatment than those seen in adolescence. Early onset scoliosis is defined as that presenting at 5 years or less. Late onset is in those over 5 years. At 5 years or less, a scoliosis can have a major impact on health if untreated. This is because a deformed spine can affect the development of heart and lungs. Long term, this can lead to breathing and blood pressure problems (pulmonary hypertension) in adulthood. A scoliosis developing over the age of 5 does not significantly impact on heart and lung development. Life expectancy is generally normal.\nThe difficulty of treating scoliosis in the young is controlling the scoliosis without interfering with growth of the spine. In adolescents, surgery involves fusing the bent part of the spine. This straightens it and prevents further growth at those levels. This is not a problem as the spine has grown enough by that age.", "score": 0.845530927, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:f67e3b9c-764b-4715-ab35-1db4899dce08>", "text": "What is scoliosis?\nScoliosis is a sideways curve in the spine. While small curves are common, only about 2-3% of people will actually develop scoliosis. A much smaller percentage of those people will actually benefit from some form of treatment.\nWhy is scoliosis important to detect?\nSome curves in the spine can get worse over time. In general, most scoliosis is at highest risk for progressing while your child is growing, and in particular while they are growing rapidly, such as around an adolescent growth spurt. When your child stops growing, most smaller curves will also stop progressing and tend to not cause significant problems later on in life. However, once curves get big enough, they may slowly get worse over time. This slow progression can be significant over the course of a lifetime and can lead to problems with increasing deformity, pain and decreased lung capacity and exercise tolerance leading to shortness of breath with exertion.\nWhat causes scoliosis?\nThere are several causes of scoliosis. In a vast majority of scoliosis (over 80%), an underlying cause cannot be determined. This most common type of scoliosis is termed “idiopathic scoliosis.” Scoliosis can also be related to abnormal formation or segmentation of the bones of the spine during fetal development. This is known as congenital scoliosis. Syndromic scoliosis refers to curves of the spine that are related to specific diagnosed conditions, such as Marfan syndrome or neurofibromatosis. Neuromuscular scoliosis is very common in conditions that can affect the function of the nerves or muscles, such as cerebral palsy, spina bifida, spinal muscular atrophy and muscular dystrophy.\nHow is scoliosis found?\nAs the spine curves, there can be subtle changes to the appearance of the body. You or your pediatrician may notice differences in the heights of the shoulders, asymmetry or protrusion of one of the shoulder blades or one side of the back, asymmetry of the waist, hips, rib cage or chest or shifting or leaning of the body to one side.\nYour child will likely be screened for scoliosis yearly by their pediatrician at their well-child checkups, particularly as they start to approach their adolescent growth spurt. Your child’s school may also perform routine screening around the same age, or as part of pre-sports participation evaluations.", "score": 0.845226347, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:78cba486-301a-4a4e-8308-5adaa67517a6>", "text": "About Scoliosis – causes, symptoms, treatment. Information for patients & parents.\nWhat is Scoliosis\nScoliosis was originally a Greek word meaning curved or bent. Today it is a word used to describe the most common type of spinal curvature. Scoliosis is simply a descriptive term, like headache, and not a precise diagnosis.\nWhen a scoliosis develops the spine bends sideways and rotates along its vertical axis. These changes have cosmetic and physiological effects with long-term consequences which may result in significant health problems with severe curves.\nTypes of Scoliosis\nThere are many causes of scoliosis, like there are many causes of headache. It is the doctor’s task to determine which type of scoliosis the patient has.\nThe word idiopathic also comes from the Greek language and means pathology unto itself. More simply, idiopathic means a condition not associated with any other disease or disorder. Unfortunately the term idiopathic is widely used in medical literature to indicate the cause of a given condition is unknown.\nThere are three main types of idiopathic scoliosis which are classified according to the age of onset.\nA curvature that develops before a child is two years old. Nine out of ten of these curves will spontaneously resolve. This type of scoliosis is very rare in Australia.\nPhysical Therapy in Infantile Idiopathic Scoliosis\nInfantile idiopathic scoliosis is a rare condition. The cause is unknown, but possible factors include birth position and sleeping position after birth. It is more common in boys. It tends to improve with simple measures such as stretching and changing sleeping position. Early diagnosis and treatment is important as the smaller curves are truly curable in most cases. These children should be seen by paediatric spinal surgeons. They will usually involve physiotherapists at children’s hospitals to teach the parents the positioning needed. Progressive cases are treated as for early onset scoliosis.\nA curve that develops in the age range of two to ten years. This type is also rare in this country.\nADOLESCENT IDIOPATHIC SCOLIOSIS (AIS)\nThis type appears in early adolescence and is much more common in girls than boys. While the incidence of very small curves is similar in both sexes, the ratio of boys to girls for curves in the treatment category is 1 : 8-10.", "score": 0.844049, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:c6658b0d-4a14-4824-82b0-00c345342ae4>", "text": "Scoliosis is a sideways curvature of the spine that occurs most often during the growth spurt just before puberty. While scoliosis can be caused by conditions such as cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy, the cause of most scoliosis is unknown.\nMost cases of scoliosis are mild, but some children develop spine deformities that continue to get more severe as they grow. Severe scoliosis can be disabling. An especially severe spinal curve can reduce the amount of space within the chest, making it difficult for the lungs to function properly.\nChildren who have mild scoliosis are monitored closely, usually with X-rays, to see if the curve is getting worse. In many cases, no treatment is necessary. Some children will need to wear a brace to stop the curve from worsening. Others may need surgery to keep the scoliosis from worsening and to straighten severe cases of scoliosis.\nCauses of Scoliosis\nThere are many types and causes of scoliosis, including:\n• Congenital scoliosis. Caused by a bone abnormality present at birth.\n• Neuromuscular scoliosis. A result of abnormal muscles or nerves. Frequently seen in people with spina bifida or cerebral palsy or in those with various conditions that are accompanied by, or result in, paralysis.\n• Degenerative scoliosis. This may result from traumatic (from an injury or illness) bone collapse, previous major back surgery, or osteoporosis (thining of the bones).\n• Idiopathic scoliosis. The most common type of scoliosis, idiopathic scoliosis, has no specific identifiable cause. There are many theories, but none have been found to be conclusive. There is, however, strong evidence that idiopathic scoliosis is inherited.\nThe majority of adolescents with significant scoliosis with no known cause are observed at regular intervals (usually every four months to six months), including a physical exam and a low radiation X-ray.\nTreatments for scoliosis include:\n• Braces. Bracing is the usual treatment choice for adolescents who have a spinal curve between 25 degrees to 40 degrees — particularly if their bones are still maturing and if they have at least 2 years of growth remaining.\nThe purpose of bracing is to halt progression of the curve.", "score": 0.843177676, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:cf61ca5a-752b-45f1-b50b-5e560c71d4cf>", "text": "In the treatment of a person with scoliosis, brace treatment is applied in patients with moderate curvature (20-40 degrees), whose skeletal development has not yet been completed, and whose curvature angle is increasing.\nCorset treatment is not effective in adults or patients over the age of 17 whose growth and bone development have been completed. The use of a corset gives more effective results with exercises specially programmed for the curvature of the person. In order for the corset to be beneficial, it is usually worn for at least 20 hours a day, if possible 22 hours a day, depending on the individual's specific situation. recommended.\nBrace treatment can prevent the increase in curvature in the majority of idiopathic scoliosis, which reaches noticeable levels in the pre-adolescent period. However, surgical treatment is the most ideal option for a group of patients for whom the brace is not successful or who are diagnosed late.\nDifferent surgical techniques are used according to the patient's age, growth stage, degree, location and type of curvature. The standard practice in surgical treatment is to fix the curvature with screws or hooks, then straighten the spine and freeze the spine in its corrected state.\nAll types of surgery involve risks and dangers. Today, however, idiopathic scoliosis surgery, which is performed by experienced hands with the possibilities of modern medicine, gives excellent results in a generally healthy adolescent without congenital defects in the spine. When discussing the risks of any treatment, it is necessary to compare the odds with untreated patients, not healthy individuals. After a successful scoliosis surgery, patients can return to their normal lives within 1 month, and after 4-6 months, they can do all the activities they could do before the surgery. Scoliosis surgery does not prevent pregnancy, having children, or having a job in the future.\nIt is not necessary to operate on the curvatures of children who have completed their growth, which do not cause aesthetic problems.

It affects people of all ages, but it often first appears in the early teens. It could be so mild that treatment is not necessary, but without proper medical care, the condition worsens with age. Sometimes this disease becomes a serious medical issue; it all depends on how severely it affects the spine. Standard scoliosis care uses body braces, but in the more severe cases, doctors could recommend surgery. Even with all the latest medical advances, these surgical procedures remain risky, and patients understandably feel hesitant overtaking this step. The exact causes of the disease are unclear, but there seems to be a genetic link.\nScoliosis twists the spine into a shape that resembles the letter \"C\" or even the letter \"S.\" Although even strong spines have a degree of curvature, the extent is markedly less. A curved spine is the most obvious outward sign of a person with scoliosis. X-rays reveal the extent to which the disease twists their spines. The older they become, the more obvious this deformity appears. Doctors define a spine curve of less than 25 percent as mild scoliosis; from 25 percent to 40 percent is moderate, and over 40 percent is severe. The health challenges a scoliosis patient faces increases according to the degree of severity.\nUneven shoulders are another of the most obvious scoliosis symptoms. Those with this symptom may also have an uneven waist or one shoulder blade that is more prominent than the other. This can result in a great deal of pain and discomfort.\nThis condition can cause the body to lean to the left, right, or forward. Walking can be painful with this condition.

That’s why it’s so important to watch out for these scoliosis symptoms, especially in children before they go through their adolescent growth spurts. Read on to learn more.\nWhat Causes Scoliosis?\nAbout 80% of scoliosis cases have no known cause. These fall under Idiopathic Scoliosis, where no exact reason is discovered for the curve of the spine.\nOther causes of scoliosis are as follows:\nCongenital scoliosis, which is a rare condition, develops in the womb before birth. Development problems in the vertebrae cause the spine to curve. It can also be the result of vertebrae failing to divide properly.\nNeuromuscular scoliosis is caused by disorders like spina bifida, cerebral palsy, or injury to the spinal cord. This damages the muscles, decreasing support for the spine and causing back curvature.\nDegenerative scoliosis develops in the lower back as a result of spine degeneration, caused by aging. This type of scoliosis commonly affects adults.\nScoliosis Symptoms In Children: Why It’s Important To Catch It Early\nScoliosis is a condition that manifests in the spine twisting and curving to the side. It affects people of all ages, but is most commonly detected in adolescents aged between 10 to 15 - an age where many undergo growth spurts that accelerate the visibility and effects of scoliosis symptoms. Because of this, it’s especially important to detect the presence of the condition early on, as proper treatment will allow for easier management and improvement of the spinal curvature. Early treatment will also ensure that the spinal curvature does not worsen.\nMany scoliosis patients improve with treatment. The goal is to detect it early, and to keep a watch so as to provide timely treatment should it worsen. For this purpose, it is recommended that parents begin screening their children as early as when they are 10 years old. Girls should be screened twice from ages 10 to 12, whilst boys should be screened once from ages 11 to 13.\nWhat Are Some Symptoms of Scoliosis?\nWhile the scoliosis symptoms may not show up the same way for all patients, these symptoms are general indicators.", "score": 0.84050864, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:45bd3cd4-f2bf-4a2b-b812-54429d38ec2f>", "text": "Because scoliosis tends to run in families, doctors believe that hereditary factors may predispose some individuals to this condition. In other cases, it can be caused by spinal abnormalities present at birth.\nOften, the body's attempt to adapt to some type of trauma or injury is involved. Even birth trauma or minor childhood injuries, such as falling off a bicycle may trigger this abnormal spinal curvature. Therefore many parents prefer to have their children checked by a chiropractic doctor at birth, and regularly throughout childhood.\nScoliosis usually starts with problems in the lower back. In younger children, such complaints are often dismissed as \"growing pains\", unfortunately delaying treatment. Scoliosis also can be associated with certain neuromuscular disorders such as polio, cerebral palsy, and muscular dystrophy. While there are many different causes for scoliosis, in 70-80% of cases there is no identifiable cause. Doctors call this \"idiopathic\" scoliosis.\nScoliosis is more common in females than males by almost 7 to 1. It continues to progress into the early 20's when the bones of the spine are fully mature. And if scoliosis progresses beyond a certain degree of curvature during adolescence, it will continue to become increasingly severe in adulthood. That is why early screening, detection, and treatment can make a big difference.\nChildren should be examined before age 12 or 13, especially if there is a history of any spinal deformity in your family. They should then be followed closely throughout the teen years to make sure a curve doesn't develop.\nScoliosis is the irregular curvature of the vertebral column, in the lateral plane, i.e.from left to right, accompanied by uneven shoulder height , irregular waistline and lumbar proeminence. It can not be treated by correcting the position of the patient. It can certainly be caused by an accident where heavy trauma caused vertebrae misalignment. It seems to me that your husband was given the right set of examinations in order to determine which damage was done : misalignment, vertebral fracturre, disc slippage and so on in order to determine the right therapy. According to the findings this can include reconstructive (kyphoplastic) surgery .

Sometimes this is the result of a childhood curvature that was left untreated and has since progressed. If scoliosis occurs in an adult with no history of a childhood curvature, it is classified as adult degenerative scoliosis. More often than not, adult scoliosis is caused by conditions such as osteoporosis or degenerative disease.\nIndividuals with adult scoliosis have distinct differences in both their symptoms and treatment options when compared to pediatric or adolescent patients.\nAdult scoliosis differs from adolescent scoliosis as the spinal curvature is commonly associated with back pain as the main presenting complaint. Curvature in the adult also tends to be severe and often progressive. The adult scoliosis deformity tends to be much less flexible, making treatment more complex. Advanced stages of degenerative disc disease may be associated with adult scoliosis and may be the primary cause of back pain for many patients. Pinched nerves from herniated discs and arthritis may also occur.\nLower back pain and postural changes are hallmark signs of adult scoliosis. Pain is usually caused by degeneration of the spine, not the abnormal curvature; however, the degenerative process can be exacerbated by the scoliosis deformity, or vice versa.\nAbnormal curvature can cause:\nTreatment for the majority of individuals with adult scoliosis is non-operative. Such treatment may include exercise and conditioning, formal physical therapy and the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications such as Ibuprofen (Motrin).

Bracing is seldom used for treatment of the adult patient but may be helpful for the elderly patient who is not an appropriate surgical candidate. Osteoporosis and osteopenia are treated with nutritional supplements such as calcium and vitamin D as well as with exercise.\nSurgery is generally indicated for patients with curves that have exhibited progression or worsening of the curvature over time and for those curves that are associated with pain that is unresponsive to other treatment, or that is associated with neurological symptoms.

If left untreated, scoliosis will only continue to progress, causing severe deformities as it twists and rotates the spine.\nThe standard treatment options for scoliosis have been the use of torso braces to stop the curve from progressing in mild cases to spinal fusion surgery, which uses hardware to hold vertebrae in place until they grow together, and spine and rib surgeries where rods are attached to the spine itself. Over time the length of these rods is adjusted to accommodate growth.", "score": 2.9180884523505853e-05, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:7263480a-5742-4650-8b83-20bd5807a0d4>", "text": "ABCs Report: group B Streptococcus, 2004\nThis website is archived for historical purposes and is no longer being maintained or updated.\nMarch 19, 2012: Content on this page kept for historical reasons.\nActive Bacterial Core Surveillance (ABCs): Emerging Infections Program Network\nCalifornia (3 county San Francisco Bay area); Colorado (children < 1 year in 5 county Denver area); Connecticut (children < 1 year); Georgia (20 county Metro area); Maryland; Minnesota; New Mexico; New York (15 county Rochester and Albany areas); Oregon (3 county Portland area); Tennessee (11 urban counties)\nThe surveillance areas represent 26,996,898 persons and 454,883 live births.

Odibo in a slightly smaller sample observed a lower detection rate for early onset preeclampsia only.

Hence the greatest value is 13,500 inch-pounds.\n91. Torsional Stress. The stresses in a twisted shaft are called \"torsional\" stresses. The torsional stress on a cross-section of a shaft is a shearing stress, as in the case illustrated by Fig. 55, which represents a flange coupling in a shaft. Were it not for the bolts, one flange would slip over the other when either part of the shaft is turned; but the bolts prevent the slipping. Obviously there is a tendency to shear the bolts off unless they are screwed up very tight; that is, the material of the bolts is subjected to shearing stress.\nJust so, at any section of the solid shaft there is a tendency for one part to slip past the other, and to prevent the slipping or shearing of the shaft, there arise shearing stresses at all parts of the cross-section. The shearing stress on the cross-section of a shaft is not a uniform stress, its value per unit-area being zero at the center of the section, and increasing toward the circumference. In circular sections, solid or hollow, the shearing stress per unit-area (unit-stress) varies directly as the distance from the center of the section, provided the elastic limit is not exceeded.

(Heck, that’s why tolerances exist in the first place!) Yet, sometimes a drawing will indicate that concentricity is required — and perfect concentricity is almost as hard to measure as it is to achieve.\n1. Definition of Concentricity\nWhat is concentricity? In geometric dimensioning and tolerancing (GD&T), concentricity is a complex tolerance — a sort of “circular symmetry” used to establish a tolerance zone for the median points of a cylindrical or spherical part.\nWhat’s the difference between cylindricity and concentricity? While cylindricity is an indicator of roundness and straightness along the full axis of a 3D part, concentricity compares an OD and ID or compares roundness at two different points.\nSometimes called coaxiality, GD&T concentricity “controls the central axis of the referenced feature, to a datum axis” according to the website GD&T Basics.\nMore simply put, you can define concentricity as a measure of the constancy of the wall thickness of a tube, pipe, or other cylinder. As such, concentricity controls a central axis that is derived from the median points of the part, measured in cross sections.\nThat means if concentricity were “perfect,” then the wall thickness between the OD and the ID would be the same in every cross section, at every point around the diameter of the tube.\nWhat makes concentricity so complex?\nWhat makes tubing concentricity such a complex feature? It relies on measurements from a derived axis as opposed to a tangible surface — creating a theoretical 3D cylindrical tolerance zone into which all the derived median points of the tube must fall.\nThat is exactly why concentricity is usually reserved for high-precision parts where there is a critical need to control those median points.\nWhat is eccentricity vs. concentricity?\nWhen you have variations in a tube’s wall thickness, you have an eccentric tube — one in which the center of the circle formed by the OD is at a different point from the center of the circle formed by the ID.", "score": 0.827475846, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:81a8e571-4ea9-41a4-ac08-6b9fc10eee34>", "text": "Design properties for circular hollow steel sections (CHS) according to EN1993-1-1\nDefinition of the cross-section\nFor typical circular circular steel sections (CHS) the geometric properties of the cross-section are defined in the following standards:\nThe geometric properties that fully define the cross-section are: external diameter D and wall thickness t.\nThe notation is defined in EN1993-1-1 §1.7 which is reproduced in the figure above.\nThe basic geometric properties of the cross-section are calculated by using the fundamental relations of mechanics.\nDue to symmetry the centroid of the cross-section (center of mass) as well as the shear center are located at the center.\nThe geometric quantities include the total area of the cross section A and the second moments of the area I, which is constant for any axis of bending due to symmetry.\nThey are calculated by adding the contribution of the external boundary and then subtracting the contribution of the internal void.\nA = π⋅D2 / 4 - π⋅(D-2⋅t)2 / 4\nI = π⋅D4 / 64 - π⋅(D-2⋅t)4 / 64\nThe shear area Av for the case of circular hollow sections is specified in EN1993-1-1 §6.2.6(3) as:\nAv = 2⋅A / π\nDue to symmetry the shear area is constant for shear load along any axis.\nElastic section modulus\nThe elastic section modulus Wel is calculated by dividing the second moment of the area I with the corresponding distance from the centroid to the most distant edge:\nWel = I / (D / 2)\nPlastic section modulus\nThe plastic section modulus Wpl corresponds to the maximum plastic bending moment when the axial force of the cross-section is zero and the stress profile is fully plastic.\nDue to symmetry when the full plastic bending stress profile is reached with zero axial force the section is divided into two parts separated by the axis of symmetry.\nThe plastic section modulus corresponds to the sum of first moments of the area of the two halves about a bending axis passing through the cetroid.\nThe plastic section modulus Wpl is calculated by adding the contribution of the external boundary and then subtracting the contribution of the internal void.\nThe centroid of a semi-circular segment is located 2D / 3π from the center of the arc.", "score": 0.82714051, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:c1a40189-4594-4ee4-b953-55bce6623fae>", "text": "Then the relation between power transmitted, unit-stress, etc., is:\nFor solid shafts, H=Ssd3n/321,000;\nFor hollow shafts, H=Ss(d4-d14n/321,000d\nExamples. 1.

These waves force on the foundations of structures, which could result in partial or full collapse of the building. As the depth of focus of a Himalayan earthquake would be of the order of 20 to 30 km, the effect of shear waves is negligible beyond 100 to 150 km from the epicentre.\nBeyond this distance, a quake travels as seismic surface waves known as Rayleigh waves. These can adversely affect tall structures, typically more than 17 metres high, located at considerable distance from the epicentre. The effect of Rayleigh Waves was notably observed at Ahmedabad during the January 2001 earthquake (magnitude 8.0). In the city, at a distance of 320 km from the epicentre in Bhuj, only tall structures suffered heavily while two or three storey buildings escaped. Similar damage was also observed at Mexico City, located at distance of about 500 km from the epicentre, during a magnitude 8 earthquake in 1986. In the NCR, likely damage from a large magnitude earthquake in the Himalayas would be due to Rayleigh waves.\nS waves cause damage by creating stress on sharp corners. Structures without sharp corners usually suffer less or no damage because the stress gets distributed almost evenly. This specific principle of even distribution of seismic stress has been effectively used in past constructions. These constructions have been standing for the last few centuries and have withstood the agony of severe seismic shaking. Kamakhay Mandir in Guwahati built in 1565 A.D. lies in the highest seismic zone, V. During the last 447 years, it has withstood three major earthquakes of magnitude 8.0 or more. The temple is still intact. There are no marks of any historical seismic damage the temple’s circular structure and the dome-type upper section.\nAnother such example is in Kangra, Himachal Pradesh, where the Bajura Mahadev Mandir, said to be 1,100 years old, is still standing, despite at least six or seven earthquakes of magnitude more than 7.5. This temple is not exactly circular.

The sample changes shape, but does not continue to change if the shear stays constant. If the shear is removed, the sample returns to its original shape. It turns out that the word \"shape\" is advisable, since the volume of the sample does not change in response to a shear stress.\nThe measure of shear stress is defined as the shear force divided by the area to which it is applied. In order to study the shear stress most simply, the forces are applied in pairs so that the net force on the object is zero, and it is not accelerated. We may imagine a force towards the right applied to the top of a cubic sample, and an equal magnitude force towards the left applied to the bottom of the sample. This stress is called a simple shear.\nThe simple shear stress has a flaw that we will point out now, and correct later. If no other forces are applied to the sample this pair of forces will produce a torque which gives the object an angular acceleration. We may imagine for now that the experiment is carried out on a table top that prevents this rotation.\nFor the shear we have imagined, the top of the cube is moved to the right so that it is no longer directly above the bottom.

Most of these arguments began after the seven years war. British came up with numerous reasons on to why they were justified in taxing American colonists.\nThe British argued that the need for defense in the British colonies was a major reason why American colonies were taxed. During war, British belief that they used a lot of money in the war, hence they needed to recover the money through taxation (Krista, 72). Perhaps, the entire colonies conquered needed defense against their enemies. This was to be carried out by trained troops; hence keeping this army required money.\nBritish national debt had increased tremendously within the seven years war. Additionally, cider tax was very unpopular among the British, and with additional pressure to reduce spending would actually lead to failure in taxing the homeland. Therefore, the money could be raised from other sources, and one of it was by taxing American colonialists.\nAnother argument is that the American colonies seemed to be under taxed. British government believed that most of the resources and money had flooded in the American colonies; hence the only way to recover is through taxation.\nBritish under King George III wanted to transform colonies economically and politically into prosperous, revenue producing, safe, and stable nations. This transformation process required a lot of money, and because American colonies would benefit, British justified its taxation policy on the colonies (Krista, 71). Furthermore, the issue of sovereignty was another justification for taxation. British believed that sovereignty would cause order in society and politics, and to maintain it required a lot of resource.\nWhat arguments did the colonists use to counter the British and which arguments seem to be most valid?\nOn the other hand, colonists believed that British were taxing them unlawfully. The acts in the laws that govern taxation was unreasonable, this included tea act and stamp act. As a matter of fact the colonists did not have a representative in the British government; this meant that no colonists would air their grievances and problems to the government. Based on this argument they created their slogan that, they would not pay tax if no one of their own will represent them (Dickinson, 447).\nThe Colonists did not see any reason paying taxes for the French Indians war.

It was controversial because whisky was produced by independent, self-sufficient frontiersmen (and women) who didn't appreciate the government imposing a tax on their livelihood. They resented the tax because they were an independent-minded people and because it was levied from a distant national government that knew little of their lives (they felt).

Britain’s debt skyrocketed in the decade before the war and King George III made matters worse by wrongly thinking a heavier tax burden was the solution.\nBy 1763, taxes were intolerable in Britain and still rising. Previous advisors to the king avoided the issue of taxing the colonies because it was unpopular on both sides of the Atlantic. But during the next four years, the British Parliament began passing laws to raise money through taxing the American colonists. These laws caused severe financial hardships in the colonies and began to engender anger toward the British government. Four acts instituted during this period can be seen as the prelude to the inevitable revolt that would follow.\nThe Sugar Act (1764)\nThe Sugar Act placed a tax on molasses, sugar, and other products imported into the American colonies from places outside the British Empire. A similar law, called the Molasses Act, had been passed in 1733, but the people had not obeyed for two reasons:\n- The taxes were too high.\n- The British government did not try very hard to enforce it.\nAny time a government does not enforce a law, people start ignoring it. In this case, the colonists openly turned to smuggling—bringing in sugar and molasses secretly to avoid paying the tax. By not enforcing its laws, Britain allowed the colonists to get used to running their own affairs.\nThe British Parliament became determined to enforce the new sugar act of 1764. When the British suddenly stiffened enforcement of the law, the colonists resented it. The British used naval patrols and royal inspectors to search colonial warehouses and even private residences, thus angering the colonists further.\nThe British even offered to share the taxes with any citizen who reported friends or neighbors who were smuggling. If the person was found guilty, the police who arrested the smuggler and the judge who found him guilty could also receive a large reward. The result of this was difficulty for someone accused of smuggling to get a fair trial.

Rhode Island ships carried small quantities of local cheese, fish, lumber, and horses (the celebrated \"Narragansett pacers\"), and larger freights of lumber, beef, fish and flour from neighboring colonies. At the British and foreign islands in the Caribbean, the ships took on cargoes of molasses, which was the cornerstone of the colony's economy. Rhode Islanders focused on the French islands, taking advantage of lower sugar and molasses prices and good markets for New England produce. But the planters in the English West Indies complained bitterly about being undercut, and in 1733, Parliament enacted the Molasses Act, which placed high duties on sugar and molasses imported into the colonies from non-British islands. However, enforcement was lax and haphazard, and colonial merchants found the law fairly easy to circumvent.\nMolasses was traded in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia for British manufactures, food supplies, and return cargoes for the West Indies trade and England. It was distilled into rum used to barter for African slaves and to supply the fishing and fur trade in North America. And of course, considerable amounts were consumed at home. In 1764 there were more than thirty distilleries in Rhode Island and several hundred people were directly dependent on its production for their livelihood. Rhode Island's business of making a living, then, depended to a large extent, directly and indirectly, upon coastal and foreign trade.

Great Britain and France, for control of resources and territory in North America and the West Indies. With Britain's victory in 1763 came the acquisition of vast American territories that necessitated increased revenues for defense and administration. To this end it was decided to enforce the navigation laws already on the books (such as the Molasses Act of 1733), to tax the colonies directly, and to use this revenue to maintain an army to protect British interests in America.", "score": 0.834509611, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:aa54a3a6-b320-466f-9068-81b295519ee7>", "text": "The dispute between Britain and her New World colonies which inspired Common Sense had been escalating for over a decade and focused on two issues: money and class. England may have triumphed over France in the Great War for the Empire, but those seven years of battle had been absurdly expensive, with annual government expenses rising from £6,500,000 to £14,500,000, driving taxes to an all-time high. Since Britain now had to defend the colonies from Spain and the 500 nations of Native America, these costs would continue inexorably, and many in Parliament couldn’t help but believe that it would be more than fair for the North Americans to be held responsible for this burden.\nThe Crown’s first attempt at extracting additional revenue from her New World territories would be the Stamp Act of 1765, a duty on just about anything printed on paper: legal writs, newspaper ads, and even merchant bills of lading. Besides having as its primary victims the most articulate and influential colonials (such as publishers like Ben Franklin and smugglers like John Hancock), the Stamp Act was the first internal tax levied by Parliament, redirecting to London monies that by English tradition had always been dispensed locally — a move that, to the colonists, was a striking diminution of their status and authority. In reply, mobs in Boston and other towns rioted, forcing stamp distributors to renounce their posts and bringing legal business to a halt.\nThe Act was repealed but on the same day, the Declaratory Act was passed, granting Parliament the power to legislate the territories “in all cases whatsoever,” with new duties imposed on the great majority of New World imports: lead, glass, paint, paper, and even tea. More than a few on the receiving end saw this as another step into subservience, not helped by the fact that the English commonly referred to Parliament and the Crown as parents, with colonists being their children. The Americans wanted to be viewed as fellow Britons, not as Raj Hindu heathens, and for the first time, the thirteen colonies acted jointly, in an organized boycott of English goods.\nIn reply, on September 30, 1768, a fleet of His Majesty’s warships appeared in Boston harbor; the next day, 1,000 armed redcoats, followed by their officers in full armor, paraded up Kings Street and assembled at the cow pasture known as Boston Common.", "score": 0.831489384, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:6fbf9687-7fcb-49f4-8207-725fe87543c9>", "text": "How England’s victory over France in the Great War for Empire contributed to the American Revolution.?\nDescribe at least three areas where the colonists’ views differed from those of Parliament and increased tensions leading to war.\n1 Answer | Add Yours\nThe elimination of the French presence in the North American continent removed a major blockage that had been holding the English colonists back from expanding westward into the interior of the continent (land that was previously claimed by France).\nThe era of \"salutory neglect\" of the colonies by the British government was at an end when George III decided that the colonists should be taxed in order to pay for the costs that Britain incurred fighting the French in North America.

However, in 1765 the Stamp Act was put forth, along with the Townshend Acts in 1767.\nWhat these acts said was that Parliament (the legislative body of Great Britain at the time) would be allowed to tax the Americans, strictly to make more money from them. Considering they were never taxed before, this caused quite an uproar in the colonies.\nBecause of this a man by the name of John Hancock, an American smuggler, ordered a boycott of tea. He told all the people in the colonies to stop buying tea sold from the British East India Company. This company at the time was the biggest monopoly in the entire world.\nIf you don't think 1 or 2 men could put a big dent in a company of that size, think again. Sales in the colonies dropped from about 330,000 pounds to 520 pounds.\nImagine having a business in which your sales to a particular country were cut in half - more than 9 times. This created much debt in the company, so Great Britain fought back and imposed the Tea Act on the colonies.\nThis Tea Act made it possible for the East India Trading Company to sell directly to the colonies instead of through multiple dealers, which effectively ruined the careers of the smugglers in America such as Hancock.\nThis left Americans even more furious because they thought it was just another attempt by Britain to undermine their supposed freedom.\nAfter many group meetings and protests, the Americans finally picked one infamous night to raid one of the ships coming in which was full of tea.\nOn December 16, 1773, a group of people known as the Sons of Liberty dressed up as Mohawk Indians and boarded the ships which were full of tea.\nThey hopped on board and carried each cask of tea and dumped it into the river. By the end of the night, over 90,000 pounds of tea were dumped into the river. It was estimated to be about a 10,000 pound loss in British money, but realize this was in 1773 .

Once this important leverage was removed, the governors could be freer to oppose the assemblies.\nTownshend went further by appointing an American Board of Customs Commissioners. This body would be stationed in the colonies to enforce compliance with tax policy. Customs officials received bonuses for every convicted smuggler, so there were obvious incentives to capture Americans. Given that violators were tried in juryless admiralty courts, there was a high chance of conviction.\nTownshend also pressed the Americans to the limit by suspending the New York legislature for failing to provide adequate supplies for the British troops stationed there. Another showdown appeared imminent.\nReactions in the colonies were similar to those during the Stamp Act Crisis. Once again nonimportation was implemented.

These stress emerged from expanding stress in between locals of Great Britain’s 13 North American colonies and the early american government (which stood for the British crown). Attempts by the British government to elevate income by collecting tax from the colonies (especially the Stamp Act of 1765, the Townshend Tariffs of 1767 as well as the Tea Act of 1773) met with negative demonstration among lots of colonists, that resented their absence of depiction in Parliament as well as demanded the very same legal rights as various other British subjects.

Today Dunhuang is home to a wealth of accumulated Buddhist art treasures.\nThey are housed in 812 cave temples located in northwest China's Gansu province. For over a thousand years, the steady influx of Buddhist thought came in the waves of monks, who traveled to the little town from India and Central Asia. Here, the monks established extensive cave monasteries and created caches of distinctive Buddhist arts. Indigenous Chinese culture was blended in with the works. Many of these objects are gathered in a newly opened exhibition: The Lights of Dunhuang at the National Museum of Fine Arts, in Beijing.\nAs they enter the gold and crimson-hued halls, visitors are immediately awed by the sheer size and quality of the collection.\nThe chronological sweep and the breadth of the artworks are revealed in ten vividly-recreated caves. There are thirteen replicas of ancient sculptures, nine originals and one hundred mural copies. All are artfully arranged throughout the entire first floor.\nViewers in the market for pure visual excitement are not shortchanged. This mammoth sleeping nirvana, vast in its size instantly evokes a mixed sense of respect and dread. Stretching over 1.8 meters in width, this statue replica was originally housed in Cave 158, at the south end of the Mogao Grottoes. \"Story of Buddha Preaching\" was painted on the adjacent wall. The cave is one of the most important nirvana caves carved during the reign of the Tibetan Kingdom of Tubo at the end of the 8th century.\nThe bulk of the caves being recreated are from the Mogao Grottoes.

On view will be paintings and sculpture by 15 modern and contemporary artists whose work has been inspired by the UNESCO World Heritage Site of Dunhuang.

A fully illustrated bilingual catalogue will accompany the exhibition.\nDunhuang, the western gateway to China, was founded by monks in the late fourth century. The site boasts more than 800 caves, including the celebrated Mogao Caves, carved into the cliffs, which offer, in the words of Dunhuang Academy director Fan Jinshi, “an unparalleled overview of one thousand years of Chinese painting.” The rich cultural history of Dunhuang is due in part to its location between Mongolia and Tibet on China’s fabled Silk Road. A crucial hub for East-West trade, it was where, as Fan puts it, “traditions of China and Western countries met, collided and merged.”\n“The powerful impact of visiting Dunhuang provokes a vast array of responses,” states Willow Weilan Hai, Director, China Institute Gallery. “I was amazed that every contemporary artist whose work is represented in Inspired by Dunhuang: Re-creation in Contemporary Chinese Art approached the caves at Dunhuang with a completely different point of view. I think all the artists would agree that their study of ancient Chinese art and culture, standing, in effect, on the shoulders of these enormously talented ancient forbears, can only fortify contemporary Chinese art.”\nThe exhibition opens with work from one of the first modern artists to find inspiration in the cave murals at Dunhuang.", "score": 0.831105888, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:dac1dc61-9c19-492c-8ca2-e4bf4b96de73>", "text": "366, a wandering monk named Yuezun saw a thousand golden Buddhas blazing in a cliff. Inspired, he chiseled a small meditation cell into the rock; others quickly followed. The first caves were no larger than coffins. Soon, monastic communities began carving out larger caverns for public acts of devotion, adorning the shrines with images of the Buddha. It is these early grottoes that inspired the nickname the Caves of the Thousand Buddhas.\nTheir canvases consisted of nothing more than river mud mixed with straw, but Dunhuang's artists would, over the centuries, record on these humble surfaces the evolution of Chinese art—and the transformation of Buddhism into a Chinese faith.\nOne of Mogao's creative peaks came during the seventh and eighth centuries, when China projected both openness and power. The Silk Road was booming, Buddhism was flourishing, and Dunhuang was paying fealty to the Chinese capital. The Tang cave painters displayed a fully confident Chinese style, covering whole walls with minutely detailed Buddhist narratives whose color, movement, and naturalism made the imaginative landscape come alive. The Middle Kingdom would later turn inward, finally shutting itself off from the world during the Ming dynasty in the 14th century.\n\"Unlike Indian Buddhists, the Chinese wanted to know in detail all the forms of the afterlife,\" says Zhao Shengliang, an art historian at the Dunhuang Academy. \"The purpose of all this color and movement was to show pilgrims the beauty of the Pure Land—and to convince them that it was real. The painters made it feel like the whole universe was moving.\"\nMore earthly tumult periodically swept through Dunhuang. Yet even as the town was conquered by competing dynasties, local aristocracies, and foreign powers—Tibet ruled here from 781 to 847—the creative enterprise at Mogao continued without pause. What accounts for its persistence? It may have been more than a simple respect for beauty or Buddhism. Rather than wiping out all traces of their predecessors, successive rulers financed new caves, each more magnificent than the last—and emblazoned them with their own pious images. The rows of wealthy patrons depicted on the bases of most murals increased in size over the centuries until they dwarfed the religious figures in the paintings.", "score": 0.830768466, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:eb18c6c5-35a7-4005-966c-9a33e1eb0d3c>", "text": "|Showing 1 to 5 of 5 Records||\nClick on a column heading to sort the list.\n|FILTER RESULTS||× Close|\n|Title||Artist||Medium & Support||Creation Date|\n|Dragon Plaque||Chinese Artist, Unknown||Jade|\n|Sichuan Qin Player||Chinese Artist, Unknown||Earthenware||206 BCE - 220 CE|\n|Figure of a Soldier||Chinese Artist, Unknown||Painted Earthenware||618-907|\n|Sancai Glazed Groom||Chinese Artist, Unknown||Glazed earthernware||618-907|\n|Sancai Glazed Groom||Chinese Artist, Unknown||Glazed earthenware||618-907|\nYour current search criteria is: Portfolio is \"Ceramics & Stoneware\" and [Objects]Display Artist is \"Unknown Chinese Artist\".", "score": 0.829904199, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:99eb351f-d2b3-45ed-9ec7-cf061b12ebed>", "text": "While most of them are in Chinese, large number of documents are in various other languages such as Tibetan, Uigur, Sanskrit, and Sogdian, including the then little known Khotanese.

The central column represent the stupa round which worshippers may circumambulate and gain blessings. Others are hall caves influenced by traditional Chinese and Buddhist temple architecture. These caves may have a truncated pyramidal ceiling sometimes painted to resemble a tent, or they may have a flat or gabled ceiling that imitates traditional buildings.\nThe murals on the caves spanned a long period of history, from the 5th to the 14th century.

By determining the ages of more Southeast Asian rock art, he will provide the Sulawesi works with a context.\nBut time is of the essence in a more urgent sense, too. As we’ve seen on all four days of cave visits, the Sulawesi paintings are under environmental attack. They are fast disappearing. Back at the Makassar offices, we sit down in the Centre’s library with a concerned Iwan Sumantri, lecturer in archeology at the city’s Hasanuddin University. “As a researcher, as an archeologist, I am very worried for the mining around the prehistoric caves in Maros-Pangkep,” he says. “Moreover, how the local people threaten the preservation of the caves, such as burning rice stalks around them—making deterioration of the rock paintings faster.”\nConservation has taken on new urgency with the new dating. Sumantri says the first step in site preservation is documentation, and that about 90 of 127 caves with art so far discovered have been recorded. Second, he advocates a public information and awareness program, followed by rules and restrictions. “Physical conservation can be conducted, for example, to make the paintings last longer by searching out materials related to other rock art paintings.” Physical barriers, like fences at some of the more important sites, will help reduce vandalism, he adds.\nAfter all, these are globally important sites. “It has implications not only for our understanding of rock art in Southeast Asia and Europe but also Australia,” writes Paul Taon of Griffith University and his co-authors in a 2014 Antiquity article entitled “The global implications of the early surviving rock art of greater Southeast Asia.” He adds, “For instance, in Kakadu-Arnhem Land and other parts of northern Australia, the oldest surviving rock art consists of naturalistic animals and stencils. This opens up the possibility that the practice of making these sorts of designs was brought to Australia at the time of initial colonization, but it may alternatively have been independently invented or resulted from as yet unknown forms of cultural contact.", "score": 0.002174321384385942, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:d9c0af35-db4a-4d60-adc7-34c67406626b>", "text": "The fire would need to be in a place with good ventilation, the researchers say, or be large enough to produce its own convection currents.\nThese experiments give us a good idea of the sort of constraints that humans in the Upper Paleolithic would have been under in terms of exploring tunnels, living in deeper parts of caves, and indeed producing cave art.\nAs Ars Technica reports, some experts have suggested that ancient cave art was designed specifically for a flickering, unsteady source of illumination – and may even have been painted to create the illusion of movement as the light wavered.\nThat's not a detail this new study goes into, but the team did run a simulation using their lighting measurements to see how these torches, lamps, and fireplaces would work in the Atxurra cave in Spain, well known for its Paleolithic-era artworks.\nIt seems that static fireplaces would have been needed to illuminate all of the art on the cave walls, as the light from torches and lamps wouldn't have stretched far enough.\nThe team behind the new study sees this as just the start of this type of investigation – more types of lighting sources and fuels can be tested, and simulated in more types of settings, to better understand how our ancestors spent their time in caves.\n\"Our experiments on Paleolithic lighting point to planning in the human use of caves in this period and the importance of lighting studies to unravel the activities carried out by our ancestors in the deep areas of caves,\" write the researchers.\nThe research has been published in PLOS One.", "score": 0.0015501886119813945, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:8e2b80fe-72f1-46ad-8e80-0e5725ea4dc2>", "text": "One of the crucial scenes in the novel A Passage to India takes place in the Caves of Malabar, in which every whisper comes back as thunder. Imagine my disappointment when I found out the caves were fictional... and my interest when it turns out they're based on a real phenomenon.\nIf you don't know it, E.M. Forster's A Passage to India is a novel that examines the social and political relationship between England and India in the 1920s. It's ightly acknowledged as one of the great English-language novels, and frequently appears on reading lists in high school and college literature courses. In the novel, the Malabar Caves are deep and complicated, and any noise made inside them, from the scrape of a match to the squeak of a boot heel, comes back as thunderous noise. The sound of the caves drives two British women temporarily mad. The caves are meant as a metaphor for both the coming revolution in India and the (at the time) unbreachable gap between the understanding of the Indians and the understanding of the British. While the Indians don't think much of the echoes, being used to even more impressive acoustics, the British can't handle them.\nLater I found out that Forster based the Malabar Caves on the Balabar Caves, which have many beauties, but to my eternal disappointment, do not have the power to drive people into altered states of mind with sound. It turns out, though, there are caves around the world that do.\nOne rock art expert believes that cave art is placed where it is as the result of specialized acoustics in caves. Clapping your hands in front of caves from Lascaux, France, to Chavín de Huántar, Peru, can create echoes that resemble all kinds of things. Researcher Steven Waller believes that the acoustic properties of the area around the paintings were meant to be as much a part of the art as the paintings themselves. Sometimes he and his colleagues can find art by clapping or shouting, and walking to the spot that has the most impressive echoes.\nHe believes art, sounds, and spirituality are bound up together. In the southwestern United States, paintings of thunderbirds tend to be in the areas where clapping or shouting returns the sound of thunder; meanwhile in France, horses and deer decorate spots on the wall where clapping will make it sound like a herd of hoofed animals running behind the cave walls.", "score": 0.0009895139744281222, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:0213fc15-78a7-4668-80bb-24fabcc4d13b>", "text": "Rock art of the Mediterranean Basin on the Iberian peninsular\nRock Art of the Mediterranean Basin on the Iberian Peninsula\nŚwiatowe Dziedzictwo – certyfikat przyznawany przez UNESCO.\nThe first example of art on the Peninsula.\nA region where the oldest known artistic expressions on Spanish territory can be found.\nThe so-called Mediterranean Arc Cave Paintings of the Iberian peninsula includes sites in the autonomous communities of Andalusia, Aragon, Castilla-La Mancha, Catalonia, the Valencian community and Murcia.

Let's say the men in the group are more comfortable playing without other groups watching them, but the women are fine with playing in front of whomever. It might be a good idea to have the men play first, to increase the chances that the following group will not be nearby enough yet to watch. The group's preferences could just as easily be reversed and there are many possible scenarios. But another consideration in this case, if pace of play is important, is to make sure that the women are as near as possible to their tees (without being unsafe) so that they can be ready to play as soon as possible after the men play their shots, rather than getting back in their golf carts and driving up to the women's tees after the men have played (that would be wasting time and holding up play). That brings me to \"let's get real\" and \"pace of play.\"\nIt's nice to know the rules, and it's nice to follow them. And etiquette is certainly an important part of the game of golf. But in casual play, especially in today's world where many courses are crowded, keeping up the pace of play is more important than following correct procedures. I'm not saying to forget about basic etiquette and be rude. Again, as long as there are no safety or courtesy issues, which player actually has the honor or who is exactly away is not important. Now if you are wagering or just playing a friendly match in a casual play situation and it is important to you to tee off in the order that honor dictates then make that clear and play that way.

By doing so, they can improve their performance on the course and achieve better results.\nSwinging for Distance\nFactors That Affect Distance\nIn golf, distance is a crucial factor that can make or break a game. However, many players often wonder if they need to swing as hard as they can to achieve maximum distance. The truth is, there are several factors that affect distance in golf, and swinging as hard as possible is not always the best approach.\nOne of the primary factors that affect distance in golf is the speed of the clubhead. When the clubhead is swung at a higher speed, it tends to impart more force on the golf ball, resulting in greater distance. However, it is important to note that there is a trade-off between speed and accuracy. Swinging too fast can cause the ball to go off-target, leading to a loss of distance.\nAnother important factor that affects distance is the angle of attack. The angle at which the club strikes the ball can significantly impact the distance the ball travels. A downward angle of attack can cause the ball to slice, resulting in a loss of distance. On the other hand, an upward angle of attack can cause the ball to hook, which can also lead to a loss of distance. Therefore, it is essential to maintain a neutral angle of attack to achieve maximum distance.\nThe type of golf club used can also affect distance. Different clubs are designed for different types of shots, and using the wrong club can result in a loss of distance. For example, using a driver with a lower loft may result in less distance than using a club with a higher loft. Additionally, the type of ball used can also impact distance. Using a ball with a higher compression rate can result in greater distance, while a ball with a lower compression rate may result in less distance.\nLastly, the conditions of the golf course can also affect distance. Factors such as wind, altitude, and temperature can all impact the distance of a shot. For example, playing in high altitude can result in a loss of distance due to the thinner air. In contrast, playing in a strong wind can result in a gain in distance if the shot is tailored to compensate for the wind.", "score": 0.826272488, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:ea910fe8-55e0-4faf-a059-c336dacfe0bc>", "text": "Tuesday, July 5, 2016\nAsk Linda #1333-Relief area smaller than one club-length\nPlayer hits the ball and it lands in a narrow space between the cart path and a bunker.

Please pick up your complimentary copy of the Rules of Golf from the Pro-Shop.\nConduct and Etiquette on the Course\nUnlike most ball games a golf course permits many matches to take place at the same time and because of this it is essential that golfers should at all times play with due thought and consideration for all other players of the course. Selfishness or ignorance on the part of other players can seriously impair the enjoyment of others.\nBearing this in mind please observe the following whilst on the course.\nCare of the Course\nHoles in bunkers\nBefore leaving a bunker, a player should carefully fill in and smooth over all holes and footprints made.\nRestore divots and plug marks\nThrough the green, a player should ensure that any turf cut or displaced is replaced at once and pressed down, and that any damage to the putting green made by the ball or the player is carefully repaired. See the section on repairing pitchmarks for more information.\nDamage to green\nFlagsticks, Bags etc. Players should ensure that when putting down bags, or the flagstick, no damage is done to the putting green and that neither they nor their caddies damage the hole by standing close to it, handling the flagstick or in removing the ball from the hole. The flagstick should be properly replaced in the hole before the players leave the putting green.\nDamage through practice swings\nIn taking practice swings players should avoid causing damage to the course, particularly the tees, by removing divots.\nConsideration For Other Players\nPlayers in range\nNo player should play until the players in front are out of range.\nIn the interest of all, players should play without delay. If a match fails to keep its place on the course, and lose in distance more than one clear hole from those in front, it MUST invite those playing behind to come through.\nSearching for a ball\nPlayers searching for a ball should signal the players behind them to pass as soon as it becomes apparent that the ball will not be easily found; they should not search for five minutes before doing so. They should not continue play until the players following have passed and are out of range.\nMarking of cards\nWhen the play of a hole has been completed, players should immediately leave the putting green.

That's a foursome of players with 10 to 20 handicaps on a standard 18-hole course with groups on every hole but not too many to cause a backup. Players who shoot par or close can finish a round in under three hours, even with a twosome. Players with a handicap of above 20 can take more than five hours to play, especially if the course is busy.\nPlayers who shoot closer to par can finish in under three hours depending on the course traffic; their shots will probably be more accurate and carry a little farther, decreasing the amount of time spent traveling and looking for balls.\nCourses differ. A round of 18 holes obviously takes longer than nine holes. Par-3 courses (total par 54) generally take less time to complete than a regulation course (par 70 to 72). Course yardage matters as well: Courses with long par-5s (550-600 yards) and 4s (400-465 yards) generally take a little longer than courses with shorter holes.\nDriving or Walking\nPlayers who ride in cart should take a little less time to play than those who are walking, though par and better players can finish in 2 1/2 hours walking without a backup on the course. When riding, sometimes it is best to drop a player off with few clubs at his ball, then drive to another ball to hit. This could save more than a half-hour each round.\nSize of Group\nGroup size makes a difference as well. Foursomes take longer than twosomes or a single, although sometimes smaller groups will pair up on the course, extending he length of the round.\nGolfers should always follow proper etiquette to not hold up others. Unless the course is empty, do not play more than one ball. Do not record your score while on the green; go to your cart or the next tee box. Play ready golf: Line up your shot while waiting for others to hit; decide on club selection, weather and wind conditions and your shot line before addressing the ball.

Use your common sense.\nKEEP IT DOWN\nRespect your fellow players. Talking, moving, or even standing close to a player while playing is poor judgment, not to mention potentially dangerous. You should refrain from whispering when a player is at the tee taking his or her practice swings and is ready to hit away. If, inadvertently, you have in some way disturbed the golfer during his or her swing, apologize. If you don’t, the rest of the game will be filled with unnecessary tension.\nON THE FAIRWAY\nCOOL YOUR JETS\nSometimes we’re anxious to tee on the next hole as soon as we finish the previous one. You might even feel tempted to move along the group ahead of you while they’re taking their second shot out on the fairway. Try to refrain from such behavior. The group ahead of you is most likely doing their best to move along too, so wait until they’re out of ball-striking distance.\nTHE DIRT ON THE DIRT\nProper play includes taking divots. In fact, if you’re not taking them, you’re probably not swinging very well. If you’ve just sent a chunk of real estate the size of Rhode Island into the next fairway, please pick it up and put it back. Replacing divots is one of the cornerstones of proper golf etiquette. Replacing divots is also essential to maintaining the course. Would you want to play on a course riddled with holes? Of course not. Chances are you wouldn’t want to find a great shot of yours nestling in one either. Riding carts often provide a small shovel and a bucket of sand to assist you in repairing a divot. Please use it.

It may sound difficult and for some, even impossible to achieve, but with proper exercise for core strength improvement, impossibility will turn into a possible outcome. Improving your core strength is a much better option than yelling \"get in the hole\" at the ball after you hit it, you need to invest in order to achieve success.\nPerhaps the most important thing that a golfer has to work on and prepare for any game of golf is complete focus. Golf is all about precision and concentration and without these, spectators would certainly take notice. A golfer's main rival would be himself, rather than his co-golfers. In line with this, the most skilled player in the bunch doesn't always win.\nCreating a Mental Picture\nBefore executing a move, a golfer should take in a few moments to build up the strength and precision, by closing his eyes and picturing the course in front of him. To improve your performance, it would certainly help that you internalize and imagine your shot as vividly and with as much feeling as possible.\nGolf is beyond just a physical sport. In fact, many people view it as a lazy sport since it does not involve running and really maximizing physical activity. It does not involve rowdily bumping into other players and tackling your enemies to win. Well, sure it may not be an extremely physical sport, but like any other sport there is, it is also important that you train your body for it.\nGolf is beyond a physical sport.", "score": 0.819220304, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:e4704dbe-f045-4d6c-ade4-439ff80d6719>", "text": "Copyright © 2011 Shaoxiang Hu et al.

That is, not only the differences of the spatial variants should be estimated by the nearby spatial points but also the differences of the time variants should be approximated by the weighted time differences of nearby points, according to the differences of gray levels between them and the consideration point. Since the time differences of nearby points using NAD can find more points with similar gray levels which form a curve belt for the center pixel on a curve edge, TSNAD can provide satisfied smoothing results while preserving curve edges.

Lightweight shaft is ideal for beginners and mid-golfers. Depending on your preferences, you can choose 52, 56, 60, 64 or 68 degrees wedges.\nThis club will surely surprise you with the consistency of its high and short hits. Beginners often buy it just to fool around, but golfers with a little experience know how to use it properly and take advantage of short distances it offers. As a bonus, the club head seems to be resistant to chipping, which is great because you will often hit the surface until you learn how to handle the mind-twisting angles.\nHowever, you should be aware that this club is heavy and offers very little to no bounce. Also, the grip is not the most comfortable one, so you should consider replacing it when you get a chance.\n8.

However, a vast majority of people, who are not nudists, see nudity as bad. We know this feeling is rooted in education as well as the fact that society has been sexualizing nudity for years. Therefore, people associate nudity to sex, and because sex is private, nudity should be. End of the story for many people.\nNudists have disassociated nudity and sex. Being naked is therefore normal, natural and social. With this, every nudist has been exposed to all sorts of nude bodies: every color, gender, body shape, scars, etc. Nudists know that nudism is all about being comfortable in our ones skin, with ones own body. When kids are exposed to nudism early or adults later when they embrace the nudism lifestyle, they understand that people are all different and come to respect, and appreciate, those differences.\nEvery time I am discussing with a nudist I do not know at a club or resort, I’m always nicely surprised by how friendly he or she is. We immediately bond because we share this wonderful lifestyle and we immediately show respect and interest. I come to believe that if nudism was more spread and accepted, people will show more respect to each other and we will face less sexual harassment situation. I am not saying that those situation do not happen in a nudist environment, predators and disrespectful people are everywhere. However, these people are faster spotted in a nudist environment, and I come to believe that by disassociating nudity from sex, people will show more respect and consideration for differences.\nWe have recently seen that the opening of a nudist/naturist space in Paris, in the Bois de Vincennes, has not creating an outcry, but has actually dragged a lot of naturists over the week-ends to enjoy shared nudity. Because it’s a public place, non nudists and nudists shared the same space with peace and acceptance. This proves that we can live together, that nudity is harmless, and has actually exposed nudism to more people, who may have been curious, are respecting others’ choice and may become nudists later.

Once a golfer has begun to adapt to the weight room and develop basic strength, the program should shift toward max strength development. After max strength is developed, a conversion to power phase will help to make that strength gained more specific to golf. This should include a specific focus on rotational power development.\n3. Side Dominance\nHaving a dominant side is characteristic of most sports.\nGolf takes this to the extreme though, as the athletes repeat a very similar swing hundreds of times a day, always facing the same direction.\nWhenever you train an athlete who is in a side-dominant sport, they are going to have a number of imbalances, which puts the athlete at increased risk of injury. A way to combat this is through unilateral exercises. Even though golf is played with both feet on the ground, golfers can benefit from unilateral training. These lifts will force each limb to perform the same amount of work and will increase the core stability needed to perform the exercise, killing two birds with one stone. You can learn more about the benefits of unilateral exercises here.\nYou may be tempted to include lifts or exercises that focus on generating power and building strength solely in the direction of the athlete's swing plane. So if the golfer is right-handed, focusing on moves where they apply force from right to left. In reality, this is about one of the worst things you can do. This will only exacerbate the athlete's already existing imbalances, dragging down performance and creating a high risk of injury. What is performed on one side must be performed on both sides.\nEvery sport is unique, and good coaches take those differences into consideration when making a strength and conditioning program. These considerations can be made for every athlete, no matter what sport they play. If you are a competitive golfer or someone who trains competitive golfers, use these three factors to get the most out of your strength program.\nPhoto Credit: CasarsaGuru/iStock", "score": 0.060017349285516, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:910db3e2-fab5-45c8-848d-3e348b3b9fc4>", "text": "The control input for the robot in their work was the torque function of the shoulder joint instead of the general ones such as the trajectory functions of joints or of club head. The change of the control input mainly results from the special dynamical characteristics of this new type of robot: the swing motion of the wrist joint is generated by the dynamic coupling drive of the shoulder joint. This point was specifically explained in the work of Ming & Kajitani. In their research, however, the difference between the golfer’s arm and the robot’s arm in mass (or the moment of inertia of arm) was not considered. In order to indicate the vital of a golfer’s arm mass, a two-dimensional double pendulum model of golf swing with normalized parameters is established. The simulation results clearly show that the mass ratio of clubs to arms and the arm mass are important factors to influence the golf swing performance. Therefore, if the optimal control torque from their work is applied to other golfers who own different-mass arms, the various swing motions would occur. In other words, the robots proposed by them at most can emulate one kind of golfers who must have the same arm mass as that of the robot. The limitation of the golf swing robots promotes us to investigate a new control method to make the robots emulate more general golfers.\nThe objectives of this dissertation are first to investigate what kind of wrist action can improve the horizontal club head speed at impact in consideration of the golf ball position, and to determine the optimum ball position at impact for various types of wrist actions; and second, to make a prototype of golf swing robot emulate swing motions of different-arm-mass professional golfers, using an impedance control method.\nThe dissertation is organized as follows: gives the wrist action study using a two-dimensional double pendulum model of golf downswing. A new two-dimensional model of golf downswing considering the bending flexibility and centrifugal stiffening of the golf shaft is established to investigate the role of the wrist action.

Effectiveness against armor deserves little if any attention as armor isn’t a feature of the game, different damage ratings don’t matter as the difference in vitality between target 1 and 2 don’t much matter as the weapon is use to force the actions of others as well as harm others.

Weapons should differentiate themselves by hoes many ranks away they can reach and if they can be used past ranks of allies as either element would have impact on combats played between ranks. It isn’t unrealistic as combat between armies and even skirmish level battles did and can depend on formation and a simple rank ordering can simulate some more cumbersome and unnecessary details re positioning.\nAn important consideration in weapon lists is how long the differences will remain valid within the game/campaign.

Students rotate through the three sections. When in the agriculture section, they spend their time in the fields learning about farm management and animal husbandry; in the horticulture section, they focus on garden and greenhouse management; the “house-i-culture” section gives students a chance to cook meals for their classmates using the food from the garden and can what they harvest.

Curricula is detailed here.\nThe Farm Program originates from Maria Montessori’s vision that all children between the ages of 12 and 18 should live on a farm and live as “children of the earth.” Montessori believed that by adolescence, students had gained enough book learning to live in the real world and get the rest of their education through real experience. Since today, such a lifestyle is not entirely possible or practical, the Meadow Montessori School farm program adapts by bringing students to the fields once a week.\nCatharine acknowledges that the program is very practical because there are so many natural consequences when working on a farm– “If you’re not mindful, the consequences are immediate. It teaches young people to think ahead and be very mindful in the moment.” Although some students are a bit hesitant when beginning their outdoor education, they quickly get over their phobias of dirt and bugs. For the most part, students are pretty enthusiastic about the program from the get-go.

This is evident not only throughout the curriculum, but in all aspects of school management and the physical school environment. The School uses natural products, as much as possible, for building and construction, as well as for cleaning and student materials. Environmental studies are incorporated into many aspects of the curriculum, with specific focus in areas such as geography, science, creative arts, and the Gardening and Glen Brook Farm Programs.\nGardening and Horticulture Program\nOne of our students’ favorite courses is our Horticulture and Gardening Program. Through this outlet, our students learn healthy eating habits, how to manage and keep a garden, and an appreciation for nature. The students also have the experience of working at an operating farm. The local organic farmer at Crossroads Farm has provided us with the knowledge and skills to carry out various projects.\nEngaging Our Students in the Gardening Program\nThe Gardening and Horticulture Program at the Waldorf School of Garden City aims to give students the experience and practical skills to grow their own food in a healthy sustainable way; not only for their bodies, but for the health and vitality of our planet earth.\nA good motto is “healthy soil makes healthy plants which makes healthy humans.” We strive to help students make the connection that working to care for the soil is ultimately caring for ourselves and each other. Here is how it works:\nThe gardening program makes its own soil for the garden beds where we grow food for our cafeteria. On a daily basis, students collect the cafeteria compost, woodwork shop scraps, handwork room scraps, leaves, and garden debris. The goal is to connect their daily lives to their food and to demonstrate how materials can turn into valuable resources. All of these materials are turned into rich humus, teeming with microbial life, for the garden.\nAfter applying the rich humus to the garden beds, the students learn how to plant seeds with proper measurements and spacing.", "score": 0.836094141, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:db76f34d-fb6b-4505-a518-638d4324798e>", "text": "Montessori program for beginners introduces two-and-a-half-year old children .to their first social experience beyond the family.

To obtain the most benefit for our students, we recommend that each child attend our school for three years, including kindergarten as Montessori classroom materials are designed to be presented over a three-year period. Participation in the early preschool program sets the stage for what is called \"an explosion of learning\" which occurs between ages 5 and 6. The kindergarten year is a culmination of a child's developmental efforts from birth. Thus, the entire program of a Montessori primary school is designed to help the child fulfill his potential during the three-year cycle from ages 3-6.\nWe also welcome children ages 4 and 5 to attend our school. Regardless of their age, each child will benefit from the Montessori approach. Each child's skills and abilities are assessed when they start school and then each teacher presents lessons that are most appropriate for their developmental stage. We have found that children benefit most when they attend school a minimum of four (4) half days a week.\nIn our specially prepared environment, activities are presented to stimulate each child's individual interests, to strengthen patience, self-confidence, intellectual curiosity and academic skills. Thus, children learn the joy of concentration, of experimentation with new concepts and materials and of work that is driven from within.\nIn addition, a series of activities based on themes (including seasons and holidays) are rotated through the classroom. Our students work on projects that develop artistic expression, carpentry skills, knowledge of geography, wildlife, science and music. They enjoy examining insects, seeds, leaves, grass, worms and even rocks under a magnifying glass and microscope.

You may have heard of them before, but do you know what sets them apart? Here is a refresher on these three unique philosophies of education.\n“Montessori is a philosophy and pedagogy based on the scientific research of Dr. Maria Montessori,” says Jeff Groh, director of The New School Montessori in Cincinnati. “Children are grouped in multi-age classrooms, where students are engaged in hands-on, self-paced, collaborative work. Multi-age classrooms allow older students to be leaders and mentors while providing opportunities for younger students to work with older classmates on group projects.”\nIn Montessori classrooms, teachers do not stand in front of a class giving lectures. Montessori teachers also don’t ask students to work on the same thing, at the same time, in the same way. “Rather, they walk throughout the classroom working one-on-one with students, or in small groups,” Groh says. “At the core of the Montessori philosophy is the belief that all students have a natural desire to learn, explore and joyfully work toward independence through knowledge and discipline.”\nChildren move freely throughout the Montessori classroom environment, working with the teacher, individually or in small groups while they choose activities that interest them. Their movement is unrestricted by the teacher, unless it endangers themselves, other people or their surroundings.\nLearning isn’t just contained indoors. Outdoor environments are important in Montessori schools, and offer opportunities to engage with the natural world.\nWhat if an argument arises in the classroom? “Children are taught how to regulate their own social interactions,” Groh says. “Through fun role-playing activities and appropriate modeling, the teacher demonstrates the best way to respond to arguments or new situations, giving the child the ability to act confidently and pro-socially when an actual problem arises. The result is a self-regulating classroom, in which natural social tensions are resolved mostly by the children themselves.”\nAt the cornerstone of the Reggio Emilia philosophy is the image of the child, says Caitlin Schroff, education director at The Compass School in Cincinnati.\n“Children are viewed as capable of finding answers to their own questions, and Reggio-inspired teachers are meant to facilitate the learning process, rather than to simply relay information,” Schroff says.", "score": 0.834402204, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:b3715d37-5087-4385-afbe-35d9ef9d4a27>", "text": "The integration of philosophy, current research in the area of child development, and content pedagogy will be the focus of this component of the program.

Among the many celebrities who can attest to the value of a Montessori education are Google co-founders Sergey Brin and Lawrence Page.\nIn addition to creating the field of anthroposophy, which is based on the belief that humans have the inherent wisdom to uncover the mysteries of the spiritual world, Austrian philosopher and scientist Rudolf Steiner developed an educational model that focused on the development of the \"whole child\" \"“ body, soul, and spirit. Influenced by the likes of Goethe and Jean Piaget, Steiner believed there were three 7-year periods of child development, and his educational approach reflected what he thought should and should not be taught during each of these stages.\nSteiner founded his first Waldorf school (the term Waldorf is now used interchangeably with Steiner to describe schools with curriculums based on Steiner's teachings) in 1919 in Stuttgart, Germany, for children of workers at the Waldorf-Astoria cigarette factory. The original curriculum spanned 12 years and aimed to prepare students \"for living,\" with an emphasis on creative expression and social and spiritual values. Within 10 years, Steiner's school in Stuttgart was the largest private school in Germany. When the Nazis closed German schools during World War II, Waldorf teachers fled to other countries, contributing to the methodology's increased post-war popularity.\nThe curriculum that defines the Waldorf method has remained relatively unchanged in the last 90 years. Steiner believed the first 7 years of a child's life, a period marked by imitative and sensory-based learning, should be devoted to developing a child's noncognitive abilities. To that end, kindergartners in Waldorf schools are encouraged to play and interact with their environment instead of being taught academic content in a traditional setting. Steiner also believed that children should learn to write before they learned to read, and that no child should learn to read before the age of 7. From age 7-14, creativity and imagination are emphasized.

We are considering a Montessori elementary school for our son. Is it tough for kids to transition to non-Montessori schools after spending a few years in a Montessori environment? We were wondering if we might be setting him up for a hard time if we decided to move him to a ''regular'' school in a few years. My question is specifically about elementary schools (not pre-schools) and leaving the Montessori program in 4th grade or so. Thank you for your thoughts. anon\nNo, it's generally not hard to transfer out of Montessori to a more traditional setting. That said, every child is different, and you have to know yours. GENERALLY speaking, well executed Montessori prepares children phenomenally well. The use of 3-dimensional materials gives kids a way to visualize and understand concepts much faster and in much greater depth than programs where teachers talk and students listen and write on paper. I recently heard an educator say there are programs where the curriculum meets the student, and programs where the student has to meet the curriculum. My experience has been that a good Montessori program - and I am talking about elementary school here - meets students in unique ways and allows them a freedom to learn and progress that traditional models probably can't do. I'll also tell you that I've heard from many, many, many parents whose kids DID transfer from Montessori to non-Montessori during elementary/junior high, and the transition was just fine. The Montessori kids just had extra skills the other kids didn't always have. If you want to read research on this, I'm pretty sure it's Dr. Angeline Lillard who's written about this and other Montessori questions. You might also try calling some of the schools you're considering after Montessori and just ask them what they've seen. Good luck.

Engaging as contributing members of a respectful community, they learn to question, think critically, and take responsibility for their own learning—skills that will support them in later education and in life.\nMontessori Elementary Learning Environments promote collaboration, research, development of fundamental academic skills as well as opportunity for community and social endeavors that help these children develop a growth mindset. Elementary students in a Montessori Environment have the freedom and flexibility to develop skills based on their interests, talents and strengths while working collaboratively with classmates, teachers and community members to contribute in diverse areas in and outside of the school environment.\nAs at all Montessori levels, the Elementary program is based on the belief that children learn best through movement and work with their hands, and provides cognitive, social, and emotional support to help them reach their full potential.\nThis includes addressing their needs as they enter a new period of development characterized by:\n- A transition from concrete to abstract thinking\n- Growing interest in socialization\n- Thinking and memory that is enhanced by creativity and imagination\n- An interest in fairness, social justice, and compassion", "score": 0.0011923496348420104, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:21ef905b-9400-4967-a478-2c4bcdd41bdc>", "text": "Cedars offers two mixed-age classrooms for students ages 6 to 9 years and one mixed-age classroom for students 9 to 12 years.\nDrawing upon the independence of the student, our program encourages self-directed study and independent research through one-on-one instruction and small group lessons to foster developing skills and knowledge.

The core idea is to present the world to the child in a holistic manner rather than the traditional way of doing so, subject by subject. The curriculum is drawn from the interconnectedness of all things. Before the age of six, the child is motivated by the what of her environment, or learning the names and physical characteristics of things. By contrast, the elementary age child is inherently inspired to learn the how and why of things. Trust in the child’s internal guide toward self-education is paramount in the Montessori classroom.

After World War I, the 113th Cavalry was constituted in 1921 as part of the Iowa National Guard and subordinated to the 24th Cavalry Division. The regiment participated in riot control duties during the Cow War in Iowa in 1931, and elements of the regiment suppressed labor unrest in Newton, Iowa in 1938. The regiment was relieved from assignment to the 24th Cavalry Division in September 1940, inducted into federal service on 13 January 1941, and moved to Camp Bowie, Texas on 25 January 1941.\nThe 113th Cavalry Regiment (Horse-Mechanized) sailed to England, arriving on 28 January 1944. In England, the regiment was converted to the 113th Cavalry Group (Mechanized), with the 1st Squadron becoming the 113th Cavalry Squadron (Mechanized) and the 2nd Squadron becoming the 125th Cavalry Squadron (Mechanized), both subordinated to the 113th Cavalry Group.

I don't have any information about the 1303rd Service Unit except that it was based in Camp Lee, Virginia in 1943.\nIt is likely that both units you are referring to were part of the same EGSR Regiment.\nThe preface of the book Patton’s Fighting Bridge Builders: Company B, 1303rd Engineer General Service Regiment, by Joseph C. Fitzharris states that Company B was just part of the Regiment, and there were six other 'line' companies within the regiment. So there were other units out there that could have been at Camp Lee.

The men trained by building bridges across the famous Spoon River in Illinois.\nSo whatever unit was present in Camp Lee, it wasn't Company B, but it might still have been another Company within the same Regiment.

Thanks to Yosemite National Park Ranger Shelton Johnson for his living history presentation and Afro-American information.\nIn Kumeyaay traditional territory: San Diego County, Camp Lockett was home to the Buffalo Soldiers. Located at Campo in the Milquatay Valley, Camp Lockett was a World War II Mexican border cavalry post established in 1941. Camp Lockett's site was chosen for a cavalry camp as far back as 1878 when sixteen troopers wearing the blue uniform of The US Cavalry bivouacked for several months in this small Mexican border valley. At that time it took a week to get to San Diego, the choicest acres of bottomland sold for $5 an acre, smugglers and belligerent, \"Indians\" were problems.\nLater the post housed prisoners of war. Late in December 1942 Camp Lockett was placed on stand by status for future use as a convalescent center. The entire camp was declared surplus on April 30, 1946.\nIn 1942, the 10th Cavalry Regiment (the famed Buffalo Soldiers) moved into Camp Lockett to replace the11th Cavalry Regiment that had been converted into an armored unit.

Lost in the vastness of the Mojave Desert, the NTC is iconic. This was the ground that sharpened the spear during the Cold War and prepared the most awesome land force ever fielded for the brutally swift victory of Desert Storm. The elite Krasnovian (politically incorrect to actually call them, “Russians,” even at the height of the Cold War) motorized and tank units thundered across the desert, taking on all comers and humbling most. Commanders have been broken at the NTC. Commanders have lost their commands at the NTC.

Following the rotation, I’d have to give it a mixed grade. Of course, we threw the NTC a curve ball on short notice. Our mission has changed from that of a full Brigade Combat Team to one whose primary job is supporting Security Force Assistance, or “SFA.” This is exactly what the Afghans need, but it is not what an IBCT is configured for. Even with that curve thrown in with short notice, my earlier excitement waned quickly.\nThe hybrid, quickly adapted scenario fielded by the NTC demonstrated that the Center is still focused on kinetics. The first part of the rotation was comprised of Situational Training Exercises, “STX’s” or “lanes” as they were called, every one of which ended in gunfire. One attempted KLE (Key Leader Engagement) developed into a gunfight literally within seconds after the group going through the lane made contact with their “Afghan” counterparts.\nTo their credit, many of the “Afghans” were actual Afghans.

This was because, unlike their Union counterparts, Confederate cavalrymen provided their own horses for service instead of drawing them from the government.\nAlthough cavalry was used extensively throughout the world during the 19th century, horses became less important to warfare after the beginning of the 20th century. Light cavalry was still seen on the battlefield at the beginning of the 20th century, but formal mounted cavalry began to be phased out for combat during and immediately after World War I, although units that included horses still had military uses well into World War II.\nWorld War I saw great changes in the use of cavalry. The mode of warfare changed, and the use of trench warfare, barbed wire and machine guns rendered traditional cavalry almost obsolete. Tanks, introduced in 1917, began to take over the role of shock combat.\nEarly in the War, cavalry skirmishes were common, and horse-mounted troops widely used for reconnaissance. On the Western Front cavalry were an effective flanking force during the \"Race to the Sea\" in 1914, but were less useful once trench warfare was established. There a few examples of successful shock combat, and cavalry divisions also provided important mobile firepower. Cavalry played a greater role on the Eastern Front, where trench warfare was less common. On the Eastern Front, and also against the Ottomans, the \"cavalry was literally indispensable.\" British Empire cavalry proved adaptable, since they were trained to fight both on foot and while mounted, while other European cavalry relied primarily on shock action.\nOn both fronts, the horse was also used as a pack animal. Because railway lines could not withstand artillery bombardments, horses carried ammunition and supplies between the railheads and the rear trenches, though the horses generally were not used in the actual trench zone. This role of horses was critical, and thus horse fodder was the single largest commodity shipped to the front by some countries. Following the war, many cavalry regiments were converted to mechanised, armoured divisions, with light tanks developed to perform many of the cavalry's original roles.\nSeveral nations used horse units during World War II. The Polish army used cavalry to defend against the armies of Nazi Germany during the 1939 invasion.

This technique can also determine the concentration of materials such as phosphorous, oxygen and pesticide residues.\nWhat are the quantitative physical and chemical parameters most often employed?\nQuantitative physical and chemical parameters such as the concentrations of phosphorous, oxygen, hydrogen ions (H+) and chlorophyll a, as well as suspended matter, are most often used to evaluate ecosystem health. Their concentrations are measured in water samples from the ecosystem under study. When in doubt, other tests could include concentrations of pesticide residues or hormone disrupters. To determine the total load of any substance in a body of water, the concentration measured must be multiplied by the flow volume.\nConcentration of phosphorous\nThe element phosphorous is present in all aquatic ecosystems and is important to its health. However, when its concentration is too high it can unbalance the ecosystem and promote the growth of aquatic plants, algae and cyanobacteria. An abnormal level of phosphorous is a symptom of accelerated eutrophication, or aging of the water body. In northern fresh water ecosystems such as Lake Memphremagog, phosphorous is the element which controls the growth of its vegetation. Phosphorous can only be used by plants in its organic form, such as phosphate. As phosphates are usually absorbed quickly and their concentration difficult to measure, preferably all forms of phosphorous are measured to obtain a better idea of the phosphorous available for aquatic plant growth.\nConcentration of oxygen\nAll living organisms need oxygen. Fish, insects and microorganisms living in the water use the oxygen dissolved in water. The more organic matter digested by aquatic microorganisms, the more oxygen they require and this can lead to a reduction in the dissolved oxygen available in the water – to the point that there is not enough for fish to survive.\nConcentration of Chlorophyll a\nChlorophyll a is a green molecule contained in all plants. Its measurement indirectly measures the quantity of plants in the ecosystem, especially microscopic algae suspended in the water.

Biologists agree that aeration helps keep a lake healthy. The benefits, of aeration, depend on the environmental factors that may influence the lake water quality. When natural mixing, of lake water, is not sufficient to maintain it in prime condition, aeration could be the answer. Aeration can improve the water quality, reduce algae problems, digest bottom organic muck and increase fish production.\nMany lakes, lagoons and ponds do not have enough water circulation. Stagnant water zones form, resulting in low dissolved oxygen (DO). These stagnant zones form on the lake bottom where they become a sump for nutrients and organic materials. A buildup of these materials, on the bottom, speeds up the eutrophication process. As this process progresses, the problem of filamentous algae, planktonic blooms, turbidity, clarity and occasional fish kills become a common occurrence.\nAeration slows down eutrophication by oxygenating the bottom waters and decomposing the organic materials that have settled to the bottom. As the organic materials and stagnant water is lifted, to the surface\nand exposed to wind, sunlight and atmospheric oxygen there is further purification of the water. The aeration will slowly break up the stagnant zones, raise the DO, decompose the organic materials and there is an improvement in water quality and fishing.\nAeration does not change the causes of eutrophication from nutrient inflow, storm-water runoff, organic accumulation and siltation. It has been demonstrated that aeration can greatly slow down the eutrophication, improving water quality, fish production and aesthetics. For this reason, aeration should be considered as part of the ongoing lake management program.\nFuture Horizons, Inc.’s biologists are often asked does our lake need aeration? The biologist can answer this question only by determining the lakes trophic state. They will measure the DO profile to determine if the lake is stratified, examine the bottom sediments and try to locate the sources of inflow into the lake. These findings are then summarized in a written report (a fee will be charged for this work if Future Horizons, Inc. does not have a lake management contact with the lake owners).\nLake owners may be able to get a rough idea of the lake condition by checking the bottom.", "score": 0.819598258, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:2acc49a0-1668-4d89-97d6-b5f35d86bfb5>", "text": "Therefore, research was also conducted to investigate methods to control and manage the rate of photons or, in other words, to identify the various photochemical pathways by enhancing the aquatic environment in order to derive quantitative expressions with relevant molecular properties of (potential) micro-pollutants of the transformation rates relating to photochemical processes.\nAn equally important factor affecting biological activity in an aquatic environment is the presence or absence of DO (Dissolved Oxygen) in its different parts. A lake receives oxygen from inflows of fresh water, from O2 transfer at the water-air interface, and from photosynthesis. The distribution of oxygen in an aquatic environment is affected by stratification and circulation often caused by wind and temperature variations, and biological activity, all of which plays a significant role in the creation of different aquatic environments. Within an aquatic environment, oxygen is consumed in the respiration of organisms living in the water. As biochemical and organic systems degrade or decompose, additional oxygen is also consumed in the chemical reactions. The DO profile in an aquatic environment is the net result of oxygen availability and oxygen consumption at different depths. While the surface layers are generally well oxygenated, the bottom or lower layers often do not receive sufficient oxygen, especially in a non-circulating system, unless there is downward diffusion through the upper layer of water, photosynthesis (if light penetration permits), or a mass exchange of water through strong circulating patterns.\nAll herbicides including the colorants cause the death and subsequent decay of the algae and plants. As these dead plants start to decay they cause an increase in the water’s demand on available dissolved oxygen. As DO levels in the water drop below 5.0 mg/L fish health and fecundity are affected. In some cases, this situation has resulted in fish kills. The need for a method of preventing weed production without persistent use of herbicides and without causing fish kills is evident.\nIn the aquatic environment, the pertinent microenvironments are particulate matter, surface film , the dissolved organic matter, and the water itself. The variations in sunlight directly affect the rate of transformation for organic micro-pollutants as well as the growth rate of algae and plants in aquatic environments. Hence, the various transport and transformation processes determine the organic micro-pollutants in the aquatic environment.\nOxygen depletion nuisances are caused by the release of excessive levels of nutrients into waterways.

Specifically, net GHG emissions should be calculated for pre- and post-flooding conditions. Given the paucity of such data, calculations will probably have to be based on emissions from flooded and unflooded areas of similar landscapes, and related estimates of the carbon budget for the respective contributing watersheds.\nThrough its strong effect on the hydrologic cycle, climate change poses a threat to the current network of dams and reservoirs. To minimize risk, more research is required to define new IDFs that can be used to gauge the safety of existing structures and to guide future constructions. There is a related need to quantify the new downstream flow and ice regimes under which dams will have to be operated to minimize downstream flood risks and disruptions to aquatic ecosystems. The potential effects on dam safety posed by climate change also raises further questions about the often-cited need to introduce a more formalized dam-safety inspection program.\nAlthough effects of impoundment on stored water and related aquatic habitats are relatively well studied, significant gaps remain in our understanding of downstream effects. For small systems, there is a dearth of data to satisfy complex IFN-style approaches for evaluating biotic impacts. Moreover, evaluation of regulated-flow impacts on medium to large rivers is in a rudimentary state of development. Since such knowledge is crucial to designing proper flow-management strategies for regulated rivers, IFN advancements need to be made. One logical course of action is refinement of remote-sensing techniques, particularly to quantification of critical habitat. Developing such tools would be particularly beneficial for evaluating near-shore and/or shallow-habitat zones, where productivity tends to be highest and most susceptible to changes in flow.\nSince effects of flow regulation have not been systematically studied for more than a few decades, a program to continue long-term assessments of such changes on Canadian rivers is needed.", "score": 0.81905055, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:69e2a66e-01aa-4d5d-8e62-c2953fc92739>", "text": "The water, with the pollutants removed, drains into a container. The volume of water in the container can be measured to determine the amount of precipitation that fell during the one-month sampling period. The amount of each pollutant captured on the resin is determined at the laboratory. (At the Canadian sites, no resin is used and the pollutants are separated from the rainwater in the laboratory.) The pollutant measurement, along with rainfall amounts, is used to find out how much of each pollutant enters the Lakes through precipitation, or wet deposition.\nConcentrations and Loadings\nThere are different ways to look at the impact of these air pollutants-two main pieces of information are concentrations in the air and rain and atmospheric loadings to the Lakes. Concentrations are simply the level of the pollutant found in air or rain (amount of pollutant found in the sample divided by the volume of air or rain sampled).\nUsing the concentrations that IADN measures, we can calculate the total amount of each pollutant transferred from the air to each of the Great Lakes for some length of time, usually a year. This is called an atmospheric loading. Here is a visualization of the different ways a pollutant can enter or leave a body of water and how these processes contribute to the total atmospheric loading. As explained earlier, net gas exchange may be positive (into the Lake) or negative (out of the Lake), depending on whether the amount absorbed is greater or less than the amount volatilized from the water. For many PBTs, gas exchange is the dominant pathway of atmospheric deposition. Therefore, the total net loading may also be out of the Lake if enough of the pollutant is volatilized-if the air is cleaner relative to the water. Weather information, the surface areas of the Lakes, and the concentrations of pollutants in the air, rain, and lake water are among the factors used to calculate loadings.\nFirst we will examine the concentrations of these persistent toxic substances over time.\nPolychlorinated Biphenyls (PCBs)\nPCBs were used widely in the U.S. for industrial purposes, including as lubricants and in electrical equipment, until the late 1970s, when manufacture ceased and uses were severely restricted. However, PCBs are still present in older electrical equipment in the U.S. and are still being used in other countries.

During 2001–10, 866 lake basins from 729 inland lakes greater than 25 acres were monitored for baseline water-quality conditions and trophic status. This report summarizes the water-quality characteristics and trophic conditions of the monitored lakes throughout the State; the data include vertical-profile measurements, nutrient measurements at three discrete depths, Secchi-disk transparency (SDT) measurements, and chlorophyll a measurements for the spring and summer, with major ions and other chemical indicators measured during the spring at mid-depth and color during the summer from near-surface samples.\nIn about 75 percent of inland lake deep basins (index stations), trophic characteristics were associated with oligotrophic or mesotrophic conditions; 5 percent or less were categorized as hypereutrophic, and 80 percent of hypereutrophic lakes had a maximum depth of 30 feet or less. Comparison of spring and summer measurements shows that water clarity based on SDT measurements were clearer in the spring than in the summer for 63 percent of lakes. For near-surface measurements made in spring, 97 percent of lakes can be considered phosphorus limited and less than half a percent nitrogen limited; for summer measurements, 96 percent of lakes can be considered phosphorus limited and less than half a percent nitrogen limited. Spatial patterns of major ions, alkalinity, and hardness measured in the spring at mid-depth all showed lower values in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan and a southward increase toward the southern areas of the Lower Peninsula, though the location of increase varied by constituent.

Membership declined and the telephone had to go but in compensation, outsiders moved in like the Guy’s Hospital staff who came to Pembury and the various assorted army units. During the war, theft of the shale court lines became such a problem that they were dispensed with until 1944.

The idea of constructing a golf course is credited to W.H. Tate, an Osterley resident who in April 1926 began the construction of a fourteen-hole course in three hay fields. The designers were F.G. Hawtree and J.H. Taylor who even to this day remain among the best golf course designers of all time. Hawtree believed that golf should be available to all and even more importantly that “manners matter, money does not”.\nPlay commenced in August 1928 only four months after the original idea was floated. In the same year the original clubhouse opened, part of which remains incorporated within the present building. By 1930 the Club had constructed an additional four holes and the inaugural match took place in May of that year.\nThe middle part of the course was turned over to agriculture during the war years and the reconstructed course was returned to 18 holes and golf in 1951. The final major change occurred in the mid-60’s when the Club lost part of the 11th and 12th holes to accommodate the M4 motorway.\nWyke Green is a private members club and became a Limited Company in 1996 following the purchase of the freehold of the course from The Earl of Jersey. The Limited Company is owned by the Members.\nSince its creation the course has been continually improved upon with its abundance of trees helping to attract a wide variety of wildlife, improve the drainage and demand that golfers ensure their aim is true.

It holds a record number of victories in the North Wales Men’s Shield, and in 1983 reached the semi-final of the National Club Championship for men.\nThe move from Garden Village to Plas Coch Road came from a need to provide better facilities for all year round tennis. The old club was on a restricted site with no room for expansion, and the shale courts were unusable during the winter. The opportunity to become involved in the LTA’s Indoor Tennis Initiative scheme was too good to refuse. Sale of the freehold helped to finance the new centre and the club changed its name to Wrexham Lawn Tennis Club at the beginning of September 1990.\nThe aim of the ITI scheme is to give greater numbers of the public the opportunity to play tennis, and the centre is managed by a company formed by members of the club and the North Wales LTA on behalf of the local authority. Strong links exist between the centre and WLTC, with the additional facilities provided for use by club members.\nThe club has four outdoor courts at the centre, two of which are floodlit. Members also have the use of the changing rooms, bar and other facilities.

But even if these experiences don’t happen and the visualization remains obscured, that obscuration itself is not different from the true spacious nature of mind itself. It always comes back to that. So the real accomplishment of the creation stage is the natural state of the completion stage.\nThe true nature of mind and all phenomena is “beyond intellect and inexpressible.” There is no intentional effort that causes its realization except that, as the text says, “the power of devotion causes it to arise from within.” This makes it difficult to write about, but a few points need to be mentioned.\nThe creation stage undermines attachment to the solid, impure phenomenal world, but can still leave us with the traces of attachment to this new manifestation that we have created or perceived. So in the completion stage, the whole new wonderful world dissolves back into basic ground, from which it never really departed. In the context of relationship with life cycles mentioned above, this stage corresponds to death. Recognizing that the visualization was created in the first place by mind, empty and radiant, and dissolves back into it, purifies or prepares us for the process of actual death, when this realization can result in full awakening.\nWithin the context of meditation, there is no longer a visualized form to work with, but there is still mind. So the discussion of the completion stage begins with a description of the mental process itself, so that the practitioner can be aware of exactly what is happening. The tradition of examining and analyzing the mental process has been a mainstay of Buddhist practice since its inception. It is sometimes referred to as Buddhist psychology. In this text the discussion centers on the eight aggregates of consciousness, a model of the perceptive process that emerged during the development of the Mahayana. The purpose of the detailed analysis is for the meditator to be able to recognize and interfere in the process at just that precise point before mental events imprint on the foundation consciousness and become karmicly effective. The thought process is not expected to cease, as in any case it is the natural, pure radiance of emptiness.", "score": 0.82289356, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:26abc4b7-e909-4c6a-bb4f-6f51a0bdd961>", "text": "After a dark period, when the anti-Buddhist king Langdarma suppressed the religion, the later spreading took place in the eleventh century, with a new influx of great teachers from India and new translations of sacred texts. Eight main practice lineages flourished, as well as many smaller ones. From those, the four main schools, which are well known today, were established: the Nyingma, Kagyu, Sakya, and Gelug.\nMany great saints and scholars from these traditions have appeared continuously in the Himalayan regions and have contributed richly to the great treasury of Buddhist literature that had been brought from India and translated into Tibetan.\nIn terms of practical application, scholars such as Jamgön Kongtrul have simply classified all those teachings and practices into the two approaches of sutra and mantra, representing, roughly, exoteric and esoteric. The sutra approach encompasses the general methods and ideas expressed in the three turnings of the wheel of Dharma. In our text, Kongtrul summarizes that approach with the famous verse:\nDoing no unvirtuous deed whatsoever,\nengaging in prolific virtuous activity,\ncompletely controlling one’s own mind,\nthis is the teaching of the Buddha.\nThe approach of mantra (Secret Mantra Vehicle) or tantric Buddhism is basically the two stages of creation and completion. But to try to practice them without the ethical foundation and mental control gained through the sutra approach is considered useless, at best. Kongtrul thus advises us in this small meditation guide on ways to practice all of the characteristic methods of both approaches. He summarizes them into three techniques for dealing with the afflictive emotions: rejection, transformation, and recognition (spang bsgyur shes gsum). These three techniques for dealing with emotions that would interfere with the meditation process clearly correspond to the three phases of teachings described above as the three turnings. Rejection of afflictive emotion reinforces the attitude of renunciation so important in the First Turning teachings. The second turning teachings are applied in transforming so-called negative states into conducive conditions on the spiritual path through meditations based on compassion and the realization of emptiness.

Buddhism characteristically describes reality in terms of process and relation rather than entity or substance.\nExperience is analyzed into five aggregates ( skandhas ). The first, form ( rupa ), refers to material existence; the following four, sensations ( vedana ), perceptions ( samjna ), psychic constructs ( samskara ), and consciousness ( vijnana ), refer to psychological processes. The central Buddhist teaching of non-self ( anatman ) asserts that in the five aggregates no independently existent, immutable self, or soul, can be found. All phenomena arise in interrelation and in dependence on causes and conditions, and thus are subject to inevitable decay and cessation. The casual conditions are defined in a 12-membered chain called dependent origination ( pratityasamutpada ) whose links are: ignorance, predisposition, consciousness, name-form, the senses, contact, craving, grasping, becoming, birth, old age, and death, whence again ignorance.\nWith this distinctive view of cause and effect, Buddhism accepts the pan-Indian presupposition of samsara, in which living beings are trapped in a continual cycle of birth-and-death, with the momentum to rebirth provided by one's previous physical and mental actions (see karma). The release from this cycle of rebirth and suffering is the total transcendence called nirvana.\nFrom the beginning, meditation and observance of moral precepts were the foundation of Buddhist practice. The five basic moral precepts, undertaken by members of monastic orders and the laity, are to refrain from taking life, stealing, acting unchastely, speaking falsely, and drinking intoxicants. Members of monastic orders also take five additional precepts: to refrain from eating at improper times, from viewing secular entertainments, from using garlands, perfumes, and other bodily adornments, from sleeping in high and wide beds, and from receiving money.", "score": 0.812660336, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:0a240a4b-dcff-4471-9ebb-e4f90db0090b>", "text": "The earliest of these translations show evidence of having been translated from the Gāndhārī language, a Prakrit. There are also images of Amitābha with the bodhisattvas Avalokiteśvara and Mahāsthāmaprāpta which were made in Gandhāra during the Kushan era.\nIn the Buddhist traditions of India, Pure Land doctrines and practices were disseminated by well-known exponents of the Mahāyāna teachings, including Nāgārjuna and Vasubandhu. Pure Land schools arose because of the belief that humans were becoming incapable of Dharma, emphasizing that humans needed help from another power; that power being Amitābha Buddha. Although Amitābha is honored and venerated in Pure Land traditions, this was clearly distinguished from worship of the Hindu gods, as Pure Land practice has its roots in the Buddhist ideal of the bodhisattva.\nPure Land sutrasEdit\nThe three principal Pure Land sūtras are the Longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra, Amitayurdhyana Sutra and the Shorter Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra. These sutras describe Amitābha and his Pure Land of Bliss, called Sukhavati. Also related to the Pure Land tradition is the Pratyutpanna Samādhi Sūtra, which gives an early description of the practice of reciting the name of Amitābha as a meditation method, although it does not enumerate any vows of Amitābha or the qualities of Sukhāvatī.\nBodhisattvas hear about the Buddha Amitābha and call him to mind again and again in this land. Because of this calling to mind, they see the Buddha Amitābha. Having seen him they ask him what dharmas it takes to be born in the realm of the Buddha Amitābha. Then the Buddha Amitābha says to these bodhisattvas: \"If you wish to come and be born in my realm, you must always call me to mind again and again, you must always keep this thought in mind without letting up, and thus you will succeed in coming to be born in my realm.\"", "score": 0.812383294, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:26abc4b7-e909-4c6a-bb4f-6f51a0bdd961>", "text": "The enormity of Kongtrul’s contribution was expressed by the late Dudjom Rinpoche as follows:\nSo if we examine Jamgön Kongtrül’s career, which produced over ninety volumes of wonderful scripture, it is as if he spent his whole life as an author.\nNone the less, if one thinks of his teaching and propagation of the empowerments, guidance, esoteric instructions, recitational transmissions, and so forth, of the ancient and new sūtras and tantras, and transmitted precepts and treasures, without bias, it is as if he spent his whole life teaching and propagating.

This understanding and interpretation of the tathagatagarbha-teachings has been a matter of intensive debates in Tibet.\nAccording to the Nyingma and Sakya schools, tathāgatagarbha is the inseparability of the clarity and emptiness of one's mind.

One is the clear light nature of the mind, a positive phenomenon, and the other is the emptiness of inherent existence of the mind, a negative phenomenon, a mere absence of inherent establishment of the mind.\nDharmadhatu is adorned with dharmakaya, which is endowed with dharmadhatu wisdom.", "score": 0.811292946, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:64070aef-bd3b-4235-8eca-3809fe9d0424>", "text": "Both of Kalu Rinpoche's parents were direct disciples of the initiators of the non-sectarian (Rime) movement, which emphasized the common ground of the Tibetan Buddhist Lineages; Jamgon Kontrol Lodro Thaye, Jamyang Keyrntse Wangpo and Mipham Rinpoche.\nWhen Rinpoche was born, above his house brilliant rainbows formed and snow fell gently like a rain of flowers.

The pāramitās furnished an arrangement of Buddhist thought and practice that focused on the ideal of the bodhisattva and how a bodhisattva was imagined to fulfill the immeasurable qualities and virtues necessary for the attainment of buddhahood. The qualities of the pāramitās and their outlines for practice were extensions of earlier mainstream Buddhist arrangements of practice, such as the three trainings (triśīkṣa) of morality (śīla), concentration (samādhi), and insight (prajñā), but were modified with the underlying ethos, aspirations, and commitments for attaining incomparable buddhahood for the welfare of all beings.\nThe lists of perfections varied according to the genre of literature in which they appeared. What practices constituted the varied lists of perfections and how the perfections were conceived differed not only among groups but also among scholarly authors.

The general concern about clock drive capability is due to multiple clock loads. Using a clock driver chip, a clock signal is turned into several, using a point-to-point connection. Select the driver chip, in addition to ensuring a basic match with the load, the signal edge meets the requirements (generally the clock is along the valid signal).

If a separate clock signal board is used, what kind of interface is generally used to ensure that the transmission of the clock signal is less affected?\nThe shorter the clock signal, the smaller the transmission line effect. Using a separate clock signal board increases the signal routing length. Moreover, the grounding power supply of the board is also a problem. For long distance transmission, a differential signal is recommended. The LVDS signal can meet the drive capability requirements, but your clock is not too fast and not necessary.\n38. 27M, SDRAM clock lines (80M-90M), the second and third harmonics of these clock lines are just in the VHF band, and the interference is very high after the high frequency intrusion from the receiving end.

At this time, you need to modify the signal duty cycle. In addition, for a clock signal that is unidirectional, source-side series matching is generally used. This suppresses secondary reflections but does not affect the clock edge rate. The source matching value can be obtained by the formula below.\n39.

For cutoff frequencies below 25.6kHz, significant power can be saved by placing the LTC1563 into the low power mode. Connect the LP pin to the V– potential to enable the low power mode. All other applications should place the part in the high speed mode by leaving the LP pin open or connecting it to the V+ potential. The high speed mode, in addition to supporting higher cutoff frequencies, has a lower DC offset voltage and better output drive capability than the low power mode. The minimum supply voltage in the high speed mode is 3V, whereas the low power mode supports 2.7V operation.

They cover cutoff frequencies ranging from 256Hz to 256kHz while operating at supplies from as low as a single 3V (2.7V minimum) up to ±5V. The LTC1563 also features rail-to-rail input and output operation with, typically, 1mV of DC offset. The design of the most popular filter responses is trivial, requiring only six resistors of identical value and no external capacitors. The cutoff frequency of unity-gain Butterworth or Bessel filters is set with a single resistor value calculated using the following simple formula:\nwhere fC is the cutoff frequency in Hertz.\nThe LTC1563-2 is used for a Butterworth response, whereas the LTC1563-3 is used for a Bessel response.\nBeyond design simplicity, the LTC1563 facilitates manufacturability. For a discrete design to achieve the ±2% cutoff frequency accuracy of the LTC1563, precision capacitors (2% or better) are required. These capacitors are not readily available and can present a difficult and costly purchasing problem. A typical discrete design also requires four resistor values and four capacitor values—eight reels of components. This leads to eight times the purchasing, stocking and assembly costs and eight reels of components on the automated assembly machine. Many large circuit boards require more component reels than the assembly machine can accommodate leading to costly secondary operations. The LTC1563 decreases purchasing, stocking and assembly costs while removing seven component reels from the assembler.\nThe LTC1563 is also very versatile. The proprietary architecture yields effortless design of the unity gain Butterworth and Bessel filter responses while still allowing complex, arbitrary filter responses with any gain desired. A Chebyshev, Gaussian or any other all-pole response, with or without gain, can be obtained using unequal valued resistors calculated with a more complex set of equations (for the best results use FilterCAD version 3.0).

To enable normal operation, the EN pin must be pulled to ground. In the shutdown mode, the supply current is typically 1µA and 20µA maximum over temperature.\nThe LTC1563 family has outstanding DC specifications. The DC offset of the filter in the high speed mode is typically ±1mV, with a maximum offset over temperature of ±3mV. The DC offset is slightly greater in the low power mode at ±5mV maximum over temperature on the lower supply voltages and ±6mV maximum over temperature on a ±5V supply. The DC offset drift is only 10µV/°C.\nThe LTC1563’s SINAD performance with lower signals is dominated by the noise of the part. Figure 4 is a plot of the noise vs the cutoff frequency. The total integrated noise (over a bandwidth of twice the cutoff frequency) is 32µVRMS at the lowest cutoff frequency and increases to 56µVRMS at the highest cutoff frequency. Figure 5 shows the SINAD performance as function of the input signal amplitude for a 50kHz signal. The plot demonstrates that distortion is not a significant factor at smaller signal amplitudes. Distortion is only noticeable when the signal amplitude is very large, within about 1V of the supply rails. The distortion performance also holds up well at higher frequencies, as Figure 6 illustrates. The SINAD is nearly flat over all frequencies, indicating again that noise is the determining function. The SINAD is about 85dB for the 3VP-P input, indicating that this part is suitable for 16-bit systems.\nTransfer Function Capabilities\nThe LTC1563 was designed to make implementing standard unity-gain, 4th order Butterworth and Bessel filters as simple as possible. Although this goal was accomplished, the part also maintains tremendous flexibility. Virtually any all-pole transfer function can be realized with the LTC1563-2. Table 1 lists the many filter configurations attainable with the LTC1563 family.

Figures 3 through 5 show that the LTC1563’s noise and SINAD is commensurate with 16-bit data acquisition systems. These measurements were taken using laboratory equipment and well-behaved loading circuitry. Many circuits will perform well in this environment only to fall apart when driving the actual A/D converter. Many modern ADCs have a switched capacitor input stage that often proves to be difficult to drive while still maintaining the converter’s 16-bit performance. The LTC1563 succeeds with only a little help from a resistor and a capacitor.\nFigure 15 shows the LTC1563-2 configured as a 5th order, 22kHz, 0.1dB ripple Chebyshev lowpass filter driving an LTC1604 16-bit ADC. The converter operates with a 292.6kHz sample clock. The 22kHz Chebyshev filter has attenuation of about 96dB at the Nyquist frequency. This is a very conservative antialiasing filter that guarantees aliasing will not occur even with strong input signals beyond the Nyquist frequency.\nFigure 16 shows a 4096 point FFT of the converter’s output while being driven by the LTC1563 at 20kHz. The FFT plot shows the fundamental 20kHz signal and the presence of some harmonics. The THD is –91.5dB and is dominated by the second harmonic at –92dB. The remaining harmonics are all well below the –100dB level. There are also some nonharmonically related spurs that are artifacts of the ADC. In the filter’s passband, the noise level is slightly higher than the converter’s. The peaking of the noise level at the cutoff frequency, mostly due to the high Q section, is a typical active filter characteristic. In the stopband, the noise level is essentially that of the converter. The end result is a SINAD Figure of 85dB, about 4dB less than the converter alone.\nThe LTC1563 continuous time, active RC lowpass filter is an economical, simple to use, yet versatile part that meets the high performance standards required in today’s high resolution systems.", "score": 0.17067487500207515, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:3fa3afaa-83a6-44e4-bb24-1ddb7cac6f48>", "text": "By making this modification to both sections, a pair of real poles is added to the 4th order network forming the desired pseudo–6th order filter. The TEE network technique is also used to give the single real pole required in all odd-order responses.\nWideband Bandpass Filters\nAlthough the LTC1563 family does not directly support classical bandpass filters, you can successfully implement a wideband bandpass filter using the standard 4th order lowpass circuit and a couple of additional capacitors. The resulting filter is more of a highpass-lowpass type of filter than a true bandpass. You can design outstanding, highly selective bandpass filters using the LTC1562 family of universal filter products (see Linear Technology VIII:1 [February 1998] and IX:1 [February 1999])—the best continuous time filters in the industry for bandpass and elliptic highpass or lowpass filters. Although the LTC1562 is the best part for narrowband bandpass filters, if your requirements are less stringent, the LTC1563 family can provide a simple, cost-effective wideband bandpass filter.\nFigure 13 shows the schematic of an LTC1563-3 used to make a simple, wideband bandpass filter centered at 50kHz. The frequency response is shown in Figure 14. The design procedure for this type of filter does not conform to any standard procedure. It is best to start with a standard lowpass filter and add two 1st order highpass sections to the transfer function. Adjust the highpass corner and the lowpass fC up and down until the desired transfer function is achieved. The design in Figure 13 starts with a standard, unity gain, 4th order Bessel lowpass filter with a cutoff frequency of 128kHz. Each section is then AC coupled through the 680pF capacitors. Each capacitor, working against its input resistor, realizes a 1st order highpass function with the cutoff frequency (11.7kHz in this design) defined by the following equation:\nThe resulting circuit yields a wideband bandpass filter that uses only one resistor value and one capacitor value. Note that although FilterCAD does not provide complete support for this type of filter with the LTC1563, you can still use the program’s Custom Design mode to set the required transfer function.", "score": 0.00018186046367348223, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:3fa3afaa-83a6-44e4-bb24-1ddb7cac6f48>", "text": "|Design||LTC1563 Support||FCAD 3.0 Support|\n|2nd order LPF||Yes||Yes|\n|Dual 2nd order LPF||Yes||Yes|\n|3rd order LPF (one capacitor)||Yes||Yes|\n|Dual 3rd order LPF (two capacitors)||Yes||Yes|\n|4th order LPF||Yes||Yes|\n|5th order LPF (one capacitor)||Yes||Yes|\n|Pseudo–6th order LPF (one part, two capacitors)||Yes||Yes|\n|Standard 6th order LPF (two parts, no capacitors)||Yes||Yes|\n|7th order LPF (one capacitor)||Yes||Yes|\n|8th order LPF||Yes||Yes|\n|9th order LPF (one capacitor)||Yes||Yes|\n|Wideband bandpass (two capacitors)||Yes||No|\n4th Order Lowpass Filters with Gain\nFilters responses other than Butterworth and Bessel, filters with gain and higher order filters are easily obtained with the LTC1563. The design equations are more complex than the simple unity-gain Butterworth and Bessel equation. Refer to the LTC1563 data sheet for the actual equations. For the best design result, use FilterCAD version 3.0 (or later). FilterCAD uses a very complex and accurate algorithm to account for most parasitics and op amp limitations. Using FilterCAD will yield the best possible design.\nFigure 7 shows an LTC1563-2 employed to make a 4th order, 150kHz, 0.5dB ripple Chebyshev lowpass filter with a DC gain of 10dB. The frequency response is shown in Figure 8. All of the gain is realized in the first section to achieve the lowest output voltage noise. Note that the schematic, and thus the PC board layout, is the same as a unity gain Butterworth lowpass filter except that the resistor values are different. The same PC board layout could be used to build an infinite number of lowpass filters, each with a different gain, transfer function and cutoff frequency.\n8th Order Lowpass Filter\nDesigning an 8th order filter is just as easy as a 4th order filter.

However, to reduce further the data required, we will need to find an alternative method, which eliminates the need for the signal time of transmission. The first reason for wanting to do this is to reduce to a bare minimum the amount of data the receiver is required to process. The second is to allow the receiver to process limited amounts of data in stand-alone chunks, without decoding the in-signal navigation data in any way. This in turn will allow the receiver to intermittently sample the incoming data stream and process the data and estimate its time and position off-line using a self-contained short-duration snapshot of data.\nIt has been demonstrated that a receiver position can be estimated using only sub-millisecond code-phase (for the case of GPS L1 C/A-code) measurements and satellite ephemeris and clock data for at least five satellites. This technique is known as time-free or snapshot positioning and reduces the data needed by the receiver to the amount required for the acquisition and tracking loops to converge to a usable code-phase estimate. In this article, we propose a technique whereby the receiver initially estimates its position using Doppler frequency measurements alone and uses this coarse position estimate to satisfy the a priori position requirement needed to perform a time-free estimate. Additionally, as Doppler measurements are influenced by the receiver dynamics, a thorough examination of the errors in Doppler estimation as a function of the receiver velocity is explored.\nThe basic processing blocks of a GNSS receiver are well known. In our research, a couple of assumptions are made regarding the overall configuration and availability of assistance data. In our operational configuration, we assume that\n- An external interface is used to import satellite ephemeris and clock information for the entire GNSS constellation.\n- The receiver acquisition and tracking algorithms are able to acquire the required number of satellites for this technique to work, thus providing the raw code-phase and Doppler measurements.\n- The receiver clock is initialized to an accuracy of approximately 20 seconds with respect to GPS System Time.\nNotably, the method proposed here does not require the receiver to synchronize and decode the navigation message data in any way, and specifically, it does not need to recover the signal transmission time. In the proposed method, the receiver can start estimating its position as soon as the signal tracking loops have settled to an acceptable accuracy.

Or is it 10 mils? Or should you go down to 1 mil? Should you include the lengths of the vias? How about the lengths of resistors? Understanding the origin of length-matching requirements, coupled with some rudimentary signal integrity analysis, can help answer these questions.\nDetermining length requirements requires an understanding of flight time, electrical length vs. physical length, loading and signal quality. Those elements are vital in determining what the length really needs to be, as well as in determining the allowable trade-offs to meet system timing goals.\nLength-matching requirements exist whenever there is a need for data to arrive at the same time. For a source-synchronous interface like memory, the data must arrive at the receiver at the same time as the clock or strobe, to make sure it is appropriately latched in at the receiver.\nFor a differential signal, length matching ensures that the two edges of the signal are aligned, and that the signal is truly “differential”—less susceptible to noise and less likely to radiate noise. So, for length-matching a clocking signal to a data signal, the requirement is usually going to be closer to the order of the bit period.\nFor a 200-MHz clock, the period will be 5 nanoseconds. That yields length-matching requirements on the order of hundreds of picoseconds, which equates to several inches on a printed-circuit board. Differential signals, however, can have edges around 50 ps, so “lining them up” would require skew on the order of 5 ps—around 30 mils on a pc board. That is much less than the skew allowable for maintaining a clock-to-strobe relationship.\nLength itself does not determine timing on a pc board. Length has a relationship to delay, but that can vary from layer to layer. So even if the signals travel the exact same length, they may not be lined up with one another in time if they are routed on different layers.\nThis is most evident when looking at outer layers vs. inner layers. Delay can be calculated using the propagation velocity of the signals, which is a function of the effective dielectric constant of the dielectric material. For FR-4 board material, the dielectric constant is around 4. For air, the dielectric constant is around 1.", "score": 7.418737510726683e-08, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:d8496005-158b-4fbf-ae9b-eb58686f9e59>", "text": "FIG. 3 illustrates a serial-parallel converter in accordance with the invention.\nFIG. 4 is a function table relating to the serial-parallel converter.\nFIG. 5 illustrates a second embodiment of a serial-parallel converter.\nFIG. 6 is a function table relating to the second embodiment of a serial-parallel converter.\nFIG. 7 is a code table for one embodiment of the encoder.\nFIG. 8 illustrates a logic function for said encoder embodiment.\nFIG. 9 is a code table for a second embodiment of the encoder.\nFIG. 10 illustrates a logic function for said second embodiment of the encoder.\nFIG. 11 illustrates a synchronous transmission system according to the invention, in which a clock signal is transmitted in a transmission channel.\nFIG. 12 illustrates an asynchronous transmission system according to the invention, wherein a clock signal is recreated from one or more data channels on a receiver side.\nFIG. 1 illustrates an inventive encoder K.

Masked Language Modeling (MLM)\nAccording to the paper:\n“The masked language model randomly masks some of the tokens from the input, and the objective is to predict the original vocabulary id of the masked word based only on its context. Unlike left-to-right language model pre-training, the MLM objective allows the representation to fuse the left and the right context, which allows us to pre-train a deep bidirectional Transformer.”\nThe Google AI researchers masked 15% of the words in each sequence at random. The task? To predict these masked words. A caveat here – the masked words were not always replaced by the masked tokens [MASK] because the [MASK] token would never appear during fine-tuning.\nSo, the researchers used the below technique:\n- 80% of the time the words were replaced with the masked token [MASK]\n- 10% of the time the words were replaced with random words\n- 10% of the time the words were left unchanged\n2. Next Sentence Prediction\nGenerally, language models do not capture the relationship between consecutive sentences. BERT was pre-trained on this task as well.\nFor language model pre-training, BERT uses pairs of sentences as its training data. The selection of sentences for each pair is quite interesting. Let’s try to understand it with the help of an example.\nImagine we have a text dataset of 100,000 sentences and we want to pre-train a BERT language model using this dataset.

I would like to use the pretrained model.\nIn order to achieve this I have an idea and need some feedback on that:\n- Split the text into a list of sentences using a sentence Sentence Boundary Disambiguation tool.\n- Tokenize each sentence using the model’s corresponding tokenizer.\n- Create our new text, by keep the first and last\nnsentences from the list and then taking a random subset of the rest of the sentences, such that all the tokens add up to 512.\nThis will not restrict the input to only the first 512 tokens and will include random sentences from the middle of the text.

The breakthroughs and developments are occurring at an unprecedented pace. From the super-efficient ULMFiT framework to Google’s BERT, NLP is truly in the midst of a golden era.\nAnd at the heart of this revolution is the concept of the Transformer. This has transformed the way we data scientists work with text data – and you’ll soon see how in this article.\nWant an example of how useful Transformer is? Take a look at the paragraph below:\nThe highlighted words refer to the same person – Griezmann, a popular football player. It’s not that difficult for us to figure out the relationships among such words spread across the text.

When you work in the hate speech arena, a key consideration is counter speech. Counter speech is speech that attempts to address hate speech / fight hate speech. Now the typical mechanism for counter speech is that it often quotes the hateful speech and then attempts to defuse it. Counter speech when processed through a well defined machine learning model tends to not be identified as hateful because the underlying model technology (Bert / Roberta / Albert) understands the linguistic nature of the speech and discount the specific nouns inside it.\nNow, given that counter speech tends to use the same words as hate speech, labeling functions that attempt to explain counter speech tend to explain it as hateful (where as the machine learning model tends to identify counter speech as non hateful). The issue here is that regular expressions don't understand the linguistic subtleties that a machine learning model based on bert / roberta / albert does understand. A possible way to address this is to enable the explain function to only operate for things are hateful not things that aren't hateful.", "score": 0.85059613, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:1a59cc7a-c314-4906-8592-43ae723495e7>", "text": "It is globally live for featured snippets too.\nA featured snippet is nothing but a brief answer to your query.

Isn’t it huge?\nSo, it is observed that the update is now able to understand the usage of each preposition and provide us with results accordingly.\nNow a big question for all the digital marketers is, should they optimize accordingly or not?\nWhat is the Architecture of BERT?\nBERT works on the Transformer mechanism, and this is an attention mechanism that analyses contextual relations among words (or sub-words) in a given text. The transformer mechanism is further enclosed with two separate mechanisms — an encoder which helps in reading the text input and a decoder that helps in producing a prediction for the task. However, BERT’s key focus is to generate a language model. Hence, only the encoder mechanism is necessary.\nInstead of predicting the next word of the sentence in a sequence, BERT makes use of a novel technique called the Masked LM (MLM): it randomly masks words of the sentence and then tries to predict the words. Masking means the model looks in both directions. It uses the full context of the sentence, and checks both left and right surroundings, in order to predict those masked words. Unlike the earlier language models, it takes both the previous and next tokens into account into consideration at the same time. The pre-existing combined left-to-right and right-to-left LSTM based models were missing this concept of “same-time part.”\nSource: Google Blog\nIn the above image, visualization of Google BERT’s neural network architecture is compared to previous state-of-the-art contextual pre-training methods is shown. The arrows indicate the flow of information from one layer to the next layer. The green boxes at the top indicate the final contextualized representation of each input word.\nHowever, the three pre-training methods differ from one another.

Specifically, we begin by training BERT models with the same configuration as BERT (, , , 110M params).\n4.1 Static vs. Dynamic Masking\nAs discussed in Section 2, BERT relies on randomly masking and predicting tokens. The original BERT implementation performed masking once during data preprocessing, resulting in a single static\nmask. To avoid using the same mask for each training instance in every epoch, training data was duplicated 10 times so that each sequence is masked in 10 different ways over the 40 epochs of training. Thus, each training sequence was seen with the same mask four times during training.\nWe compare this strategy with dynamic masking where we generate the masking pattern every time we feed a sequence to the model. This becomes crucial when pretraining for more steps or with larger datasets.\nTable 1 compares the published BERT results from devlin2018bert to our reimplementation with either static or dynamic masking. We find that our reimplementation with static masking performs similar to the original BERT model, and dynamic masking is comparable or slightly better than static masking.\nGiven these results and the additional efficiency benefits of dynamic masking, we use dynamic masking in the remainder of the experiments.\n4.2 Model Input Format and Next Sentence Prediction\n|Our reimplementation (with NSP loss):|\n|Our reimplementation (without NSP loss):|\n|XLNet (K = 7)||–/81.3||85.8||92.7||66.1|\n|XLNet (K = 6)||–/81.0||85.6||93.4||66.7|\nIn the original BERT pretraining procedure, the model observes two concatenated document segments, which are either sampled contiguously from the same document (with ) or from distinct documents. In addition to the masked language modeling objective, the model is trained to predict whether the observed document segments come from the same or distinct documents via an auxiliary Next Sentence Prediction (NSP) loss.\nThe NSP loss was hypothesized to be an important factor in training the original BERT model.", "score": 0.847339272, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:31b66a45-8283-4b76-bcd4-9f0d9c491d34>", "text": "BERT — Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers, is specially designed for understanding the Natural Language processing better, which follows on from RankBrain — It was the last change in Google’s search algorithm, announced five years ago.

The company said that BERT can impact the searches by almost 10%. It also helps in understanding search queries better by comprehending the context behind a search. As a result, the users get relevant and accurate search engine results page (SERP).\nLet’s understand how does BERT. works with the help of an example.\nThere are two phrases, “six to nine” and “a quarter to four.”In both the phrases, “to” give different meanings. A human mind could distinguish between both but search engines failed to find out the difference. But today, Google has BERT, which is designed to find the differences between such words and the users can have more accurate results.\nWhat is Natural Language processing?\nTo understand the impact of BERT on the SERP, it is important to know what is Natural Language processing.\nAccording to Google Natural Language processing is:\nGoogle Cloud Natural Language reveals the structure and meaning of text through powerful pretrained machine learning models”\nIn quote simply, Natural Language processing is a branch of artificial intelligence, which handles tasks like linguistics. This helps computers to understand communication the way human minds do. Some of the changes made by Natural Language processing include chatbots, social listening tools and word suggestions on smartphones.\nIs BERT a replacement to RankBrain?\nWell, definitely not! BERT is not replacement to Rankbrain because RankBrain is not dead and it is still used for some queries. When it comes to BERT, it is the latest algorithm that helps Google understand the content and searches in natural language.

We release our model, pretraining and fine-tuning code implemented in PyTorchPaszke et al. (2017).\nIn this section, we give a brief overview of the BERT Devlin et al. (2019) pretraining approach and some of the training choices that we will examine experimentally in the following section.\nBERT takes as input a concatenation of two segments (sequences of tokens), and . Segments usually consist of more than one natural sentence. The two segments are presented as a single input sequence to BERT with special tokens delimiting them: . and are constrained such that , where is a parameter that controls the maximum sequence length during training.\nThe model is first pretrained on a large unlabeled text corpus and subsequently finetuned using end-task labeled data.\nBERT uses the now ubiquitous transformer architecture Vaswani et al. (2017), which we will not review in detail. We use a transformer architecture with layers. Each block uses self-attention heads and hidden dimension .\n2.3 Training Objectives\nDuring pretraining, BERT uses two objectives: masked language modeling and next sentence prediction.\nMasked Language Model (MLM)\nA random sample of the tokens in the input sequence is selected and replaced with the special token . The MLM objective is a cross-entropy loss on predicting the masked tokens. BERT uniformly selects 15% of the input tokens for possible replacement. Of the selected tokens, 80% are replaced with , 10% are left unchanged, and 10% are replaced by a randomly selected vocabulary token.\nIn the original implementation, random masking and replacement is performed once in the beginning and saved for the duration of training, although in practice, data is duplicated so the mask is not always the same for every training sentence (see Section 4.1).\nNext Sentence Prediction (NSP)\nNSP is a binary classification loss for predicting whether two segments follow each other in the original text.", "score": 0.845934272, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:a1b9db82-b2ab-4c2d-9dc3-0857654c5328>", "text": "BERT could mask it like this:\nPotter is a series of fantasy novels written by J.K.

It takes into account the sequence of sentences and the distances between them, for example, to understand the logical flow of a paragraph. Most importantly, however, there is a method known as continuous training, which allows you to train on new dates and new tasks without forgetting the ones you have learned before. As a result, over time, it can become better and better at performing a wide range of tasks with minimal human intervention.\nBaidu is actively using ERNIE to provide users with more applicable search results, remove duplicate messages in its news feed, and improve the ability of its AI Assistant Xiao Du to respond accurately to queries. ERNIE’s latest architecture was described in a paper presented at the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence conference June 11-14 ( https://icwsm.org/2019/index.php ). Just as their team built on Google’s work with BERT, the researchers hope that others will also benefit from their work with ERNIE.\n“When we started this work, we specifically thought about certain characteristics of the Chinese language,” said Hao Tian, chief architect of Baidu Research. “But we quickly discovered that they were applicable", "score": 0.845240235, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:7c3400a4-66a6-4f12-9bd2-e3e4eef96d03>", "text": "GPT-2 is a close copy of the basic transformer architecture.\nGPT-2 does not require the encoder part of the original transformer architecture as it is decoder-only, and there are no encoder attention blocks, so the decoder is equivalent to the encoder, except for the MASKING in the multi-head attention block, the decoder is only allowed to glean information from the prior words in the sentence.

(2018) proposed the idea of applying the Transformer model for language modeling. As per the paper, the entire corpus can be split into fixed-length segments of manageable sizes. Then, we train the Transformer model on the segments independently, ignoring all contextual information from previous segments:\nThis architecture doesn’t suffer from the problem of vanishing gradients. But the context fragmentation limits its longer-term dependency learning. During the evaluation phase, the segment is shifted to the right by only one position. The new segment has to be processed entirely from scratch. This evaluation method is unfortunately quite compute-intensive.\nUsing Transformer-XL for Language Modeling\nDuring the training phase in Transformer-XL, the hidden state computed for the previous state is used as an additional context for the current segment. This recurrence mechanism of Transformer-XL takes care of the limitations of using a fixed-length context.\nDuring the evaluation phase, the representations from the previous segments can be reused instead of being computed from scratch (as is the case of the Transformer model). This, of course, increases the computation speed manifold.\nYou can access the code to implement Transformer-XL here.\nThe New Sensation in NLP: Google’s BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)\nWe all know how significant transfer learning has been in the field of computer vision. For instance, a pre-trained deep learning model could be fine-tuned for a new task on the ImageNet dataset and still give decent results on a relatively small labeled dataset.\nLanguage model pre-training similarly has been quite effective for improving many natural language processing tasks: (https://paperswithcode.com/paper/transformer-xl-attentive-language-models and https://paperswithcode.com/paper/transformer-xl-attentive-language-models).\nThe BERT framework, a new language representation model from Google AI, uses pre-training and fine-tuning to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks.

BERT update started rolling out on October 24th 2019 and has shown an important impact on rankings for many English language queries.\nFor SEO specialists, BERT is a real challenge because, even though we reached some conclusions upon certain important factors to pay attention when optimising websites, there is still a lot to discover and test.\nWe know that, for a busy marketer, staying in touch with all the news in the field may be difficult. This is why, since we have already read a ton of material on Bert and NLP, we would like to share our most interesting findings with you.\nWhat Is Bert Update and what is it used for?\nWe start by explaining what BERT stands for and how it functions. Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers is Google’s neural network-based technique for natural language processing (NLP) pre-training. The AI-powered Google update was created and published in 2018 by Jacob Devlin and his colleagues from Google and is used to help machines better understand the nuance and context of words in search queries and better match the queries with useful results. In short, if Google used to process words one-by-one in order, thanks to the new technology, Google processes texts as a whole, understanding context and the searcher’s intent behind search queries.\nHow Does BERT function?\nAccording to Search algorithm patent expert Bill Slawski (@bill_slawski of @GoFishDigital), this is how BERT functions:\n“Bert is a natural language processing pre-training approach that can be used on a large body of the text. It handles tasks such as named entity recognition, part of speech tagging, and question-answering among other natural language processes.", "score": 1.7951975987689967e-08, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:940f8f86-a8d2-4db9-beb6-3ebcfd64fc8a>", "text": "Self-training methods such as ELMo Peters et al. (2018), GPT Radford et al. (2018), BERT Devlin et al. (2019), XLM Lample and Conneau (2019), and XLNet Yang et al. (2019) have brought significant performance gains, but it can be challenging to determine which aspects of the methods contribute the most. Training is computationally expensive, limiting the amount of tuning that can be done, and is often done with private training data of varying sizes, limiting our ability to measure the effects of the modeling advances.\nWe present a replication study of BERT pretraining Devlin et al. (2019), which includes a careful evaluation of the effects of hyperparmeter tuning and training set size. We find that BERT was significantly undertrained and propose an improved recipe for training BERT models, which we call RoBERTa, that can match or exceed the performance of all of the post-BERT methods. Our modifications are simple, they include: (1) training the model longer, with bigger batches, over more data; (2) removing the next sentence prediction objective; (3) training on longer sequences; and (4) dynamically changing the masking pattern applied to the training data. We also collect a large new dataset (CC-News) of comparable size to other privately used datasets, to better control for training set size effects.\nWhen controlling for training data, our improved training procedure improves upon the published BERT results on both GLUE and SQuAD. When trained for longer over additional data, our model achieves a score of 88.5 on the public GLUE leaderboard, matching the 88.4 reported by yang2019xlnet. Our model establishes a new state-of-the-art on 4/9 of the GLUE tasks: MNLI, QNLI, RTE and STS-B. We also match state-of-the-art results on SQuAD and RACE.

However, because the doc-sentences format results in variable batch sizes, we use full-sentences in the remainder of our experiments for easier comparison with related work.\n4.3 Training with large batches\nPast work in Neural Machine Translation has shown that training with very large mini-batches can both improve optimization speed and end-task performance when the learning rate is increased appropriatelyOtt et al. (2018). Recent work has shown that BERT is also amenable to large batch training You et al. (2019).\ndevlin2018bert originally trained BERT for 1M steps with a batch size of 256 sequences. This is equivalent in computational cost, via gradient accumulation, to training for 125K steps with a batch size of 2K sequences, or for 31K steps with a batch size of 8K.\nIn Table 3 we compare perplexity and end-task performance of BERT as we increase the batch size, controlling for the number of passes through the training data. We observe that training with large batches improves perplexity for the masked language modeling objective, as well as end-task accuracy. Large batches are also easier to parallelize via distributed data parallel training,888Large batch training can improve training efficiency even without large scale parallel hardware through gradient accumulation, whereby gradients from multiple mini-batches are accumulated locally before each optimization step. This functionality is supported natively in fairseq Ott et al. (2019). and in later experiments we train with batches of 8K sequences.\nNotably you2019reducing train BERT with even larger batche sizes, up to 32K sequences. We leave further exploration of the limits of large batch training to future work.\n4.4 Text Encoding\nByte-Pair Encoding (BPE) Sennrich et al.

We then encode each of these four sequences and pass the resulting [CLS] representations through a fully-connected layer, which is used to predict the correct answer. We truncate question-answer pairs that are longer than 128 tokens and, if needed, the passage so that the total length is at most 512 tokens.\n|Single models on test (as of July 25, 2019)|\nResults on the RACE test sets are presented in Table 7. RoBERTa achieves state-of-the-art results on both middle-school and high-school settings.\n6 Related Work\nPretraining methods have been designed with different training objectives, including language modeling Dai and Le (2015); Peters et al. (2018); Howard and Ruder (2018), machine translation McCann et al. (2017), and masked language modeling Devlin et al. (2019); Lample and Conneau (2019). Many recent papers have used a basic recipe of finetuning models for each end task Howard and Ruder (2018); Radford et al. (2018), and pretraining with some variant of a masked language model objective. However, newer methods have improved performance by multi-task fine tuning Dong et al. (2019), incorporating entity embeddings Sun et al. (2019), span prediction Joshi et al.", "score": 2.6080853708319628e-11, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:940f8f86-a8d2-4db9-beb6-3ebcfd64fc8a>", "text": "We present our results in Table 5. In the first setting (single-task, dev), RoBERTa achieves state-of-the-art results on all 9 of the GLUE task development sets. Crucially, RoBERTa uses the same masked language modeling pretraining objective and architecture as BERT, yet consistently outperforms both BERT and XLNet. This raises questions about the relative importance of model architecture and pretraining objective, compared to more mundane details like dataset size and training time that we explore in this work.\nIn the second setting (ensembles, test), we submit RoBERTa to the GLUE leaderboard and achieve state-of-the-art results on 4 out of 9 tasks and the highest average score to date. This is especially exciting because RoBERTa does not depend on multi-task finetuning, unlike most of the other top submissions. We expect future work may further improve these results by incorporating more sophisticated multi-task finetuning procedures.\n5.2 SQuAD Results\nWe adopt a much simpler approach for SQuAD compared to past work. In particular, while both BERT Devlin et al. (2019) and XLNet Yang et al. (2019) augment their training data with additional QA datasets, we only finetune RoBERTa using the provided SQuAD training data. yang2019xlnet also employed a custom layer-wise learning rate schedule to finetune XLNet, while we use the same learning rate for all layers.\nFor SQuAD v1.1 we follow the same finetuning procedure as devlin2018bert. For SQuAD v2.0, we additionally classify whether a given question is answerable; we train this classifier jointly with the span predictor by summing the classification and span loss terms.\n|Model||SQuAD 1.1||SQuAD 2.0|\n|Single models on dev, w/o data augmentation|\n|Single models on test (as of July 25, 2019)|\n|XLNet + SG-Net Verifier||87.0||89.9|\nWe present our results in Table 6.

Instead of predicting the next token based on the preceding tokens, as in traditional generative models, BERT employs a Masked Language Model (MLM), which randomly replaces a subset of tokens by a special token , and tries to predict them from the rest of the words. The training objective is the cross-entropy loss between the original tokens and the predicted ones. BERT builds on the transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017)\nwith its multi-head self-attention mechanism, which has demonstrated high performance in parallel computation and modeling long-range dependencies, as compared to recurrent neural networks such as LSTM(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997). The input consists of text spans, such as sentences, separated by a special token . To address out-of-vocabulary words, tokens are divided into subword units using Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) (Sennrich et al., 2016) or its variants (Kudo and Richardson, 2018), which generates a fixed-size subword vocabulary to compactly represent the training text corpora. The input is first passed to a lexical encoder, which combines the token embedding, position embedding, and segment embedding by element-wise summation. The embedding layer is then passed to multiple layers of transformer modules to generate a contextual representation (Vaswani et al., 2017).\nPrior pretraining efforts have focused frequently on the newswire and web domains. For example, the BERT model was trained on Wikipedia333http://wikipedia.org and BookCorpus (Zhu et al., 2015), and subsequent efforts have focused on crawling additional web text to conduct increasingly large-scale pretraining (Liu et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2020; Brown et al., 2020). For domain-specific applications, pretraining on in-domain text has been shown to provide additional gains, but the prevalent assumption is that out-domain text is still helpful and pretraining typically adopts a mixed-domain approach (Lee et al., 2020; Gururangan et al., 2020).

When their chosen subject and topic of research is accepted, they begin their actual research work. After completion (exploring the unknown and coming up with answers to problems identified), the research has to be submitted for approval. This is one procedure that needs the research to be presented in a standardized format known as research report. Though both research proposal and research report contain the same outlines, there are major differences between these two documents that will be highlighted in this article.\nFor a new student, putting forward a research proposal is even more difficult than actually conducting research. However, this is one aspect that is more than mere formality, and requires not just subject knowledge but also an insight into the problem that the researcher proposes to explore to come up with his analysis and answers to the problems. Research proposal should clearly include the research methodology, design structure and the logic researcher is going to use. Budget, time limit, and qualifications of the researcher are points that matter a lot to those who grant approval. As these cannot be changed, it is prudent to harp upon the problem statement and the solutions sought.\nA research report is the culmination of all the effort, sweat and toiling that a research student undergoes during actual research process. Once the research has been completed, a formal submission is required which takes place in the form of a research report. This is a document that reflects the potential of the researcher and should contain all the information and facts in a standardized format that enables any casual onlooker to get everything easily out of the report.

The aim of this passage is to put forward your claim in a confident and precise way. It should be clear and to the point stating the main idea of the whole paper. Research paper writers recommend mentioning facts that are the most relevant to the topic.\n- A background in argumentative research paper writing can help when explaining the development of the main idea. You are supposed to mention your primary resources and give definitions of the specific theories and terms. All these actions will set the paper tone.\n- Evidence. This is the most important part of your argumentative research paper, therefore pay special attention to it. You are required to present case studies, relevant supporting facts, statistical data and other information. You should do this in a sequential and organized manner. Here again, we can help you to create and organize your paper in the best way.\n- Counter balancing. No argumentative research paper is finished without a counter balancing of the view. You should prove you have carried out a lot of research and can provide a balanced approach.\n- Conclusions. This is the restatement of your original idea. Professional research paper writers do not provide any new information here. You should prove that your arguments from the introduction are true.\nOne more important thing to mention is to use simple language – it is a key to the success of your argumentative research paper. Of course, you may use specific language and technical terms, but only where it is necessary.\nArgumentative Research Paper Help\nAn argumentative research paper is a type of academic paper involving a lot of investigation, reading, and critical thinking.

Your proposal should include the following sections:\n- THE PROBLEM: Provide a Succinct Statement (one paragraph)\nResearch is not a summary of what is available on a given topic but an original analysis of a specific problem. A research problem is distinct from a topic in that it is more specific and orients research toward an analysis or solution.\nResearch questions have to be complex. If you already know the answer to the question, or if it can be obtained through a few simple inquiries, it is not an adequate research problem.

In a proposal, that section provides a brief overview of the larger issues and ideas of your topic, and how this specific research problem relates to these larger issues. Whatever you choose to highlight, the reader should be convinced that your research will contribute to our understanding of broader social, historical or cultural issues.\n- LITERATURE REVIEW: Enter into the Scholarly Conversation\nA research project should be original, rather than reproducing existing literature on the topic. Yet it is helpful to consider any current research as part of a scholarly conversation. The literature review section of your proposal is an opportunity to begin that conversation by reviewing the research to date, indicating what aspects of it your project will build upon and the ways that your proposed research differs from what has already been done.

It's worth noting that most proposals don't include a summary (abstract) before the introduction.\nBackground and Significance: This is the section where you explain the context of your idea and why it's significant.

In his haunting 1967 poster for Henning Carlsen’s Hunger, the title squats in the cerebrum of a ravaged anatomical skull, the rounds of its letters looking like misplaced eyes. His poster for Haskell Wexler’s Medium Cool is all lettering: a multihued pop-art assemblage of license plates and bumper stickers. But it is his iconic poster for Hitchcock’s The Birds that uses type most dramatically, with the repeated Polish title advancing in swarms behind a death’s-head on wings. Zelek, who passed away in 2018 at the age of 82, made more than 100 posters in the 1960s while working as an assistant to the great progenitor of the Polish Poster School, Henryk Tomaszewski, at the Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts. Though he ostensibly retired from graphic design in 1970 and moved to Vienna to devote his life to painting, his stark, iconic posters have remained hugely influential. His image of disembodied hands embracing the back of an anonymous head for Far From the Madding Crowd (1967) was “borrowed” 40 years later in the international posters for Woody Allen’s 2010 You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger, while his composition for the Brigitte Bardot love triangleTwo Weeks in September(1967), in which hands cradle an empty swath of halftone dots, may well have influenced Vasilis Marmatakis’s design for The Lobster. Hands feature prominently in much of Zelek’s work: a finger morphs into the barrel of a revolver for Support Your Local Sheriff! (1969), and a black hand containing Brock Peters’s superimposed face reaches for the sky in To Kill a Mockingbird (1962). Though he tended to favor monochrome photographs with the contrast turned up high, he occasionally used bold planes of color, as with his blue-faced Lee Marvin—a rare image of a movie star in his work—for Point Blank (1967).", "score": 0.811093, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:03e24769-66cb-44de-b892-f11c40ae090b>", "text": "Typographic Film Posters Depict Cinema’s Best Lines\n17th and Oak sells prints of famous movies featuring iconic characters.\nFilm buffs can now have their favorite film characters and movie lines on their walls with these creative typographic posters from 17th and Oak.

He used a Canon 1D X camera and an 800m f/5.6L IS lens (this thing is huge) with a 2x teleconverter to get the shot seen above.

Answers by Joe Kalinowski,Creative Director at Content Marketing Institute\nBUDDY: The iconic JAWS movie poster was not the first version, right? What were some of the other versions?\nJOE K: The original hard cover was black and white painted by artist Paul Bacon for Bantam Books. It was a more simplistic version of the iconic image featuring a white translucent shark veering up towards a swimmer painted in the same style. The shark had no eyes or teeth, just the recognizable shape of the shark’s head and mouth. When Bantam released the book in paperback, they revisited Bacon’s image. They hired artist Roger Kastel to use Bacon’s hardcover image as a starting point, but they were suggesting Kastel to make the image a bit more realistic and of course menacing. Kastel did such an impressive job that Universal Studios chose to use that image for the iconic movie poster.\nBUDDY: Why do you think they selected the iconic version? Why does it work?\nJOE K: There are so many reasons that this image works! First, even if you were living under a rock and never heard of JAWS, you could tell just by the image what is happening: Very large shark about to prey on unsuspecting swimmer. The image is unbelievably simple, yet so captivating at the same time. The use of a basic color palette of red, white, blue and black (with minor shades of pink for the swimmer’s skin) keeps the visual noise down (notice there’s no sky above the surface?). The movement that is created by the simple brush strokes around the swimmer’s arms and legs to show splashing, and the bubble around the shark’s mouth to show it’s speed as it swims toward the surface is quite impressive considering it’s a two dimensional image. The use of black to accentuate the shark’s teeth and cavernous mouth was a win, not to mention the cropping of the image inside that thick black border to strengthen the focal point of the ferocity of the shark.", "score": 5.813586445698496e-06, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:f3bba86b-dd5b-4556-ab91-6411c5d9deb4>", "text": "A very special opportunity to acquire one of the greatest unseen treasures of movie poster art.

The iconic and fantastical imagery of the Star Wars saga has adorned cinema walls courtesy of many of the greatest poster artists of the twentieth century; Tom Chantrell, the Brothers Hildebrandt, Drew Struzan, Tom Jung and Roger Kastel amongst them.\nIn 1977, following the US release of Star Wars, producer Gary Kurtz and 20th Century Fox took the opportunity to commission a new poster for the UK and international release. This would replace the atmospheric Hildebrandt artwork, and the design brief was for ‘action’ and to put more emphasis on the human characters.\nThe commission came to fellow artists Tom Beauvais and Tom Chantrell both of whom created alternative artwork for the client. For his design Beauvais used wonderfully vibrant day-glo paint to make the title and lightsaber ‘pop’ with bright colour.\nBeauvais’ bold composition is dominated by an over-sized Luke and Leia. Particular attention has been paid to capturing actor Mark Hamill’s likeness, and uniquely this remains the only theatrical Star Wars poster in which Luke is depicted in his Stormtrooper disguise.\nIcons of Star Wars – R2D2, C3PO, the Death Star, X-Wings, and lightsabers – also feature, as does an indication of the written credits along the bottom of the poster.\nDespite the eye-catching boldness of Beauvais’ design, it was his friend Tom Chantrell’s version that won over 20th Century Fox. They used it extensively for the film’s international campaign, and it has gone on to be celebrated not just as Chantrell’s masterwork but as one of the most iconic movie posters of all time.\nAlthough he missed out on Star Wars, Tom Beauvais’ body of work would include many other high profile movies, including: Fantastic Voyage, Butch Cassidy And The Sundance Kid, Zombie Flesh Eaters, Blade Runner and Mad Max.

And the way we farm also takes an increasing toll on the environment. Farming emits a third of all greenhouse gases and uses 70 percent of freshwater resources. It is a major contributor to deforestation and biodiversity loss, and has led to the loss of soil fertility in agricultural lands. How can we produce enough food for the future while protecting the planet? Healthy bee populations are a key element. Bees pollinate 75 percent of crops in the world, but their populations are suffering from a variety of threats. Berkeley conservation biologist Claire Kremen has demonstrated how restoring natural vegetation where bees can thrive preserves biodiversity while it maintains healthy crop yields. Diversified farming too -- growing multiple crops instead of monoculture -- improves soil fertility and requires less pesticides. Together, these practices can maintain productivity while using less energy, water and pesticides -- a boon to climate stability.\nClaire is an ecologist who develops conservation and sustainable management plans, considering both protected areas and the working lands matrix around them. Her current research focuses on exploring the benefits, costs, and barriers to adoption of diversified farming systems, and on restoring pollination and pest control services in intensively farmed landscapes, using both predictive modeling and field studies.

That is also true of private industry, which has been working hard to come up with answers to why bee populations have been declining.\nPollinator health was a topic at several sessions during the Beltwide Cotton Conferences, including a briefing held by Bayer CropScience’s for the media attending the National Cotton Council’s annual education transfer event. Allen Ayres, state affairs director for Bayer, discussed his company’s efforts in a video interview.\nSome stress is placed on honey bees in transferring them from one locale to another for use as pollinator services. Ayres noted the almond crop requires about 1.6 million of the 2.6 million hives in the U.S. each year in California alone.\n“Bees are very important to various crops,” he said. “One issue has been habitat and enough forage to keep the bees healthy. This is important because it is very laborious, it’s expensive, it’s difficult for the beekeepers to have to artificially feed them with sugars, and they much prefer to let them forage naturally.”\nAs part of its ongoing effort to find better ways to provide habitat and improve bee health, Bayer CropScience is building a Bee Care Center in its complex at its headquarters in Research Triangle Park in North Carolina.\n“We already have research team that has been working and will be moving into this new facility in the next three or four months,” Ayres noted. “It will bring a focus to the research we’ve been doing these past few years to bring together this collaboration in a more focused approach, and it will give us an opportunity to do this bee research to find better ways to control these pests.”\nFor more information about honey bee research, click on http://deltafarmpress.com/management/protecting-pollinators-mississippi-organizations-develop-guidelines", "score": 0.82148689, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:bd6e22d6-229e-4a1e-8ade-48b8c6b6c583>", "text": "The changing British landscape could be contributing to the decline in our bee populations, according to Lancaster University research.\nAnalysis of 35 hives in 20 sites in North West England found that honeybees living near areas of extensive farmland were surviving on a lower protein diet than those in hives near natural grasslands and woodlands.\nBees consuming less protein early in life may be left vulnerable to other factors such as pesticides, disease or harsh winters. Poorer quality diets could, in part, explain why honeybee populations are in decline.\nBees depend on pollen and nectar for their food which they acquire from a range of flower species.\nWhilst nectar is converted to honey in the hive, pollen is converted to “beebread”, which is consumed by the growing young brood.\nTo conduct their study, the researchers regularly analysed the composition of ‘beebread’ in different hives – testing its nutritional value throughout the summers of 2012-13.\nBy combining these data with extensive land-use data generated by Countryside Survey 2007, they found that beebread protein content was lower in areas where arable and horticultural farmland surrounded the hives, but beebread found in hives near natural grasslands and broadleaf woodlands had higher protein levels.\nProtein levels in beebread vary because not all pollen is equal. Some species of plant produce pollens naturally very high in protein, and some not so. Previous studies suggest that the protein content of pollen varies across plant species from around 2.5% to 62%.\nThe finding that beebread protein content is correlated with land use suggests that landscape composition may impact on the wellbeing of bees.\nPhilip Donkersley, who led the research at Lancaster University’s Environment Centre, said: “Honeybees have different nutritional requirements at different stages of their lives, with larvae primarily requiring protein.

For some yet undetermined reason bee-farming has been diminishing around the world as bees have been dying dreadfully, and now an Austrian film-maker, Markus Imhoof, also a bee-farmer, has made this picture—not as an attack on the danger but as a general illuminator. Bee farming has been around for 15,000 years, and a lot of notable minds—Einstein among them—have said that if bees were to disappear, human beings would disappear within four years. Imhoof makes bees more important than they have previously seemed.\nImhoof takes us to bee farms on two continents. First in Austria, he shows a huge Alpine crag, then a close-up of a tray jammed full of tiny bees. The astonishing thing is that as we watch the swarm crawling over one another, different bees for a second or two become individual, trying to get somewhere or other. Then we see them being handled by the farmers, who seem almost to know them, breaking them into groups, stripping them of their honey, arranging them for shipment, and so on.\nImhoof takes us also to the American West, where again on bee farms we see immense fields of flowers, pastures for the bees, and again further treatment of the bees that shows a respect for them as something more than mere property.

One of the best ways to prevent opioid dependence is to reduce the usage of opioids to treat pain in the first place. That search for alternative treatments is leading to renewed interest in a very old method for relieving discomfort.\nAcupuncture offers a whole body approach to treat a wide variety of troubles — from insomnia, to digestive issues, to stress. And importantly, it may be especially effective for treating chronic pain.\nBut acupuncture has not been widely covered by many insurance companies, especially for those on Medicare or Medicaid, creating a barrier for those who might benefit. The Community Health Plan of Washington (CHPW) hopes to change that and recently unveiled newly expanded coverage for Washington residents on Medicare/Medicaid that covers acupuncture to treat chronic pain and opioid addiction. CHPW Chief Medical Officer Dr. Paul Sherman hopes that this new expanded coverage will provide more options for people seeking relief.\n\"We're trying to build up our toolkit so patients can find the 'tool' that works best for them,\" Sherman explains. \"With this, we have the broadest coverage of any Medicaid plan in the state.\"\nThe CHPW insurance will cover up to six acupuncture visits for anyone, with no referral or diagnosis needed. Approval is required for more than six visits.\nWith their expanded coverage, CHPW hopes to give patients alternative options to treat chronic pain and opioid addiction and to push other insurance providers in the same direction.\n\"There are two ways acupuncture can help reduce opioid dependence,\" Sherman says. \"First, it can help avoid the need for opioid treatment in the first place. Second, acupuncture treatment can also reduce opioid withdrawal symptoms.\"\nJessica Sleight, licensed acupuncturist and East Asian medicine practitioner at Balance Point Acupuncture in the South Perry district also believes that increasing public access to acupuncture can provide an effective treatment option for those struggling with chronic pain.\nBut what does a visit with an acupuncturist actually entail? Sleight says there are multiple features she will assess to help her reach a diagnosis. \"There are 26 different main categories of how you can have a pulse diagnosis in acupuncture,\" she says. In addition to the acupuncture \"pulses,\" there are several more considerations that can help your acupuncturist figure out how to treat your symptoms.", "score": 4.090915885706e-05, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:c8b0c271-a0f1-4721-8661-fba4433713dc>", "text": "As an organization, we believe:\n1.

It is also known as low-level laser therapy(LLLT). Laser acupuncture is the same as normal acupuncture except that a laser beam is used instead of a traditional penetrating needles. This is great if you are not too keen on the idea of needles being inserted into the skin.\nWhat does it do?\nLaser beam can produce low-heat light, pressure and electromagnetic wave. It can stimulate the acupuncture point of human body, and input an energy into it. It promote biological function, regenerate tissue or stimulates and enhances cell function and alleviate pain. It may possess the function of both acupuncture and moxibustion.\nWhat conditions can be benefit with laser acupuncture?\nEvidence was found to support the use of laser acupuncture in the treatment of myofascial pain, postoperative nausea and vomiting and for the relief of chronic tension headache. Laser acupuncture would appear to represent an effective form of acupuncture for the management of these conditions. It could be considered as a viable alternative to more traditional forms of acupuncture point stimulation.\nLaser acupuncture can be used for to relieve pain such as back pain, osteoarthritis, headache;\nLaser acupuncture is also an excellent alternative approach for\n- Children or\n- People who are shy away from real Acupuncture needles.\nThe therapy uses low powered lasers which targets specific acupuncture points, selected because of their effect on endorphins and their ability to help the body to detox and heal.\nIs laser acupuncture painful?\nLaser acupuncture is a totally pain free therapy. Actually during the treatment you may not feel any thing. Therefore it has been used for patients who shy away from needles or for Children’s conditions.\nIs laser acupuncture safe?\nThere are no known adverse side effects of laser acupuncture after it has been used in clinic for over 25 years.\nHowever laser acupuncture are not used on the skin with melanoma, patient with epilepsy history, or have radiotherapy less than 6 months.\nAt any time, safety goggles should be worn when having treatment.\nBaxter GD, Bleakley C, McDonough S., Clinical effectiveness of laser acupuncture: a systematic review.

The U.S. Medicare system is about to give this strategy a try, for treating back pain.\nLast week, Medicare announced that it wants to start paying for studies of acupuncture as a treatment for low back pain, as reported by the Washington Post and Stat. The government's reason, according to Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar, was that we need this option to help solve opioid addiction:\n“Defeating our country’s epidemic of opioid addiction requires identifying all possible ways to treat the very real problem of chronic pain, and this proposal would provide patients with new options while expanding our scientific understanding of alternative approaches to pain.”\nIf you break down HHS Secretary Azar's statement, it's mostly correct. Yes, treating opioid addition should explore all methods for treating chronic pain. And yes, this program will provide \"new\" options, even though the option in question is nonsense.\nBut (3) no, studying acupuncture will not expand our scientific understanding of \"alternative approaches\" to pain. Why not? Because thousands of studies have already been done, and the verdict was in, long ago, that acupuncture is nothing more than an elaborate placebo.\nThe problem is, acupuncture proponents never give up. Every time a study shows that acupuncture fails (and this has happened, repeatedly), they claim it wasn't done properly or make another excuse. I've even seen proponents argue that studies in which acupuncture failed were in fact successes, because acupuncture and placebo treatments both outperformed the \"no treatment\" option.\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE\n(Aside: we use placebo treatments because we've known for decades that any treatment, even a sugar pill, may show a benefit as compared to no treatment at all. Acupuncture research has created placebos by using fake needles that don't actually pierce the skin, or by placing needles in random places rather than the so-called acupuncture points. Scientifically speaking, if a treatment doesn't outperform a placebo, then the treatment is a failure.)\nTo make matters worse, the new HHS program will fund \"pragmatic\" clinical trials rather than the usual, gold-standard randomized trials (RCTs). Without going into details, let's just say that pragmatic trials are much less well-controlled than RCTs, allowing more room for mistakes and misinterpretation.

Acupuncture for pain management is a complementary therapy that is being increasingly used in the day-to-day management of pain.\nCan acupuncture help with pain management?\nAcupuncture can help with drug-free pain relief and management. According to the National Institute of Health (NIH, a part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, also the nation’s medical research agency), a number of studies suggest that acupuncture works particularly well on chronic pain such as back and neck pain; osteoarthritis/knee pain; and headache. It often reduces the incidence and severity of tension headaches and may prevent migraines. “Therefore,” the NIH concludes, “acupuncture appears to be a reasonable option for people with chronic pain to consider”. Both the National Institutes of Health and the World Health Organization has acknowledged acupuncture as an effective treatment modality for conditions involving pain and nausea.\nA review article that appeared in Practical Pain Management found that pain relief with acupuncture comes from inactivating the source of pain by modulating endorphin levels.

In addition, trials on neck pain, headache, and osteoarthritis in the knee have all shown that acupuncture not only reduces pain but also improves patients’ physical function in the long term.\nAcupuncture is effective for acute pain\nThe 2010 edition (3rd ed.) of “Acute Pain Management: Scientific Evidence” by the Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists and Faculty of Pain Medicine states that there is level one evidence (the highest level) that acupuncture is effective in reducing post-operative pain and opioid-related adverse effects.”\nHow does acupuncture work with pain management?\nAcupuncture is an integral part of Traditional Chines Medicine (TCM).", "score": 2.107224919713419e-05, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:d84db550-de85-4739-a15a-27c995469a52>", "text": "What is Acupuncture?\nAcupuncture is an integral part of Traditional Chinese Medicine and has been used in East Asian countries for over 2000 years to address and try and prevent illnesses. Chinese Medicine is a comprehensive medical system with its own principles, diagnostic methods and therapies, including acupuncture, moxibustion and cupping. It views the body as an organic whole with a network of meridians connecting and coordinating the internal organs, Qi (often translated as vital energy), blood, body fluids, muscles, bones, tendons and the skin.\nChinese Medicine looks at pain and illness as a sign that this network is out of balance. Acupuncture treatment aims to restore this balance by promoting the body’s ability to heal itself and so resolving or managing symptoms and encouraging and maintaining good health.\nAcupuncture involves the insertion of very fine, sterile, single-use needles on specific points on the body. It is drug-free and may be a clinically effective treatment method for a variety of health issues including non-specific lower back pain, osteoarthritis of the knee and tension-type headaches. Acupuncture treatment can help with pain relief and management, stress and chronic pain related to depression by managing the underlying chronic pain.\nIt may also be able to assist with\n- Management of pain, stress and fatigue related to some autoimmune disorders, in consultation with other treating health practitioners\n- Management of pain, fatigue and nausea related to many chronic diseases\n- Management of vomiting or nausea arising from chemotherapy\nDuring pregnancy, acupuncture may be able to help women with:\n- Pregnancy related musculoskeletal pains\n- Nausea and vomiting\nAcupuncture is suitable for people of all ages and can be used safely alongside conventional medicine with the correct guidance from your acupuncturist.

Chronic pain costs the U.S. economy an estimated $100 billion annually, including healthcare expenses, lost income and lost productivity.\nWhile many patients feel better with conventional pain management treatment, others continue to struggle to live their normal lives. That’s when it can be helpful to combine mainstream therapies with complementary or alternative therapies for which there is scientific evidence of safety and effectiveness.\nSome examples of complementary therapy include anti-inflammatory diets, exercise and stress management that can be used to help lessen pain. Other alternative therapies for chronic pain and stress include:\n- Acupuncture—inserting hair-thin needles into points of the body to stimulate healing and pain relief\n- Chiropractic or osteopathic manipulation—which can help relieve neck pain, headaches, spinal pain and more\n- Cranial sacral therapy—a gentle, hands-on technique that releases compression in the bones of the head, spine and lower back\n- Massage—which can be used with exercise and education to treat non-specific lower back pain. It can improve blood and lymph flow, relax muscles, and reduce anxiety and depression.\n- Mind-body therapies—such as hypnosis, guided imagery, cognitive-behavioral therapy, support groups, meditation and breath work.\n- Reiki—which has shown positive results in healing wounds and treating pain, anxiety, arthritis and various orthopaedic conditions.\nAbout the Speaker\nWilliam Welches, DO, PhD is an associate staff physician in Cleveland Clinic’s Department of Pain Management and is board certified in family practice medicine.

The expression that is used to refer to God in the Old Testament is frequently translated, “Jehovah”, and in some versions, “the LORD.” YAHWEH is how hayah has traditionally been written in translations of the Bible because of the lack of vowels in the Hebrew language. So, references to God in the Hebrew Old Testament are using the word YAHWEH—that is to say, “He is”. The stress rests upon the deathlessness of this true God revealed in the Old Testament.\nHe is the one who “is” and therefore He can speak of Himself as, “I AM” or “I AM THAT I AM”. What we have in YAHWEH itself is a testimony to the undying nature of God. “He is” is a testimony to His self-existence. He is the living God; He is YAHWEH; He is I AM; He is the one who has life in Himself; He is deathlessness.

In using the phrase “I Am” this way, Jesus was calling their attention back to the account of the burning bush in Exodus where God identified Himself as “I Am”:\nEx. 3:13-15 Moses said to God, “Suppose I go to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you,’ and they ask me, ‘What is his name?’ Then what shall I tell them?”\nGod said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM. This is what you are to say to the Israelites: ‘I AM has sent me to you.’”\nGod also said to Moses, “Say to the Israelites, ‘The LORD, the God of your fathers—the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob—has sent me to you.’ This is my name forever, the name by which I am to be remembered from generation to generation.\nThe Jewish leaders understood Jesus correctly when He applied one of God’s titles to Himself, and…\n…they picked up stones to stone him… (John 8:59).\nBut there are, of course, many other times, especially in the Gospel of John, when Jesus uses the phrase “I am.” The question is, when is He intentionally referring to His own deity?\nThe tool for discovering that is Context. For example, when the High Priest asks Jesus if He is the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One, Jesus answers:\nMark 14:62 “I am,” said Jesus. “And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven.”\nNot only does He use the phrase emphatically, but He connects it to a reference in Daniel’s prophecy of the Messiah, the Son of Man, entering God’s presence (Dan. 7:13).", "score": 0.838667631, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:5368d647-9e5e-48e9-9864-d0701c0b9c46>", "text": "| || || |\nHow Does God Calls Himself? e.g \"i am the bread of life\"\nAsked Nov 4, 2006, 12:41 PM\nHello my name is kate, and I'm doing a project on Religion.

These angels are part of Daniel's apocalyptic visions and are an important part of all apocalyptic literature. Coogan explains the development of this concept of angels: \"In the postexilic period, with the development of explicit monotheism, these divine beings—the 'sons of God' who were members of the Divine Council—were in effect demoted to what are now known as 'angels', understood as beings created by God, but immortal and thus superior to humans.\" This conception of angels is best understood in contrast to demons and is often thought to be \"influenced by the ancient Persian religious tradition of Zoroastrianism, which viewed the world as a battleground between forces of good and forces of evil, between light and darkness.\" One of these is hāšāṭān, a figure depicted in (among other places) the Book of Job.\nPhilo of Alexandria identifies the angel with the Logos inasmuch as the angel is the immaterial voice of God. The angel is something different from God himself, but is conceived as God's instrument.\nIn post-Biblical Judaism, certain angels took on particular significance and developed unique personalities and roles. Although these archangels were believed to rank among the heavenly host, no systematic hierarchy ever developed. Metatron is considered one of the highest of the angels in Merkabah and Kabbalist mysticism and often serves as a scribe; he is briefly mentioned in the Talmud and figures prominently in Merkabah mystical texts. Michael, who serves as a warrior and advocate for Israel (Daniel 10:13), is looked upon particularly fondly. Gabriel is mentioned in the Book of Daniel (Daniel 8:15–17) and briefly in the Talmud, as well as in many Merkabah mystical texts. There is no evidence in Judaism for the worship of angels, but there is evidence for the invocation and sometimes even conjuration of angels.\nAccording to Kabbalah, there are four worlds and our world is the last world: the world of action (Assiyah). Angels exist in the worlds above as a 'task' of God.

The actual length of time it stays in your system is dependent on a variety of factors.\nA person’s height, weight, and gender are all contributing factors. For example, since women produce less enzymes that help metabolize alcohol, it takes longer for a female to break down alcohol versus a male of equal size and weight. Whether a person has eaten anything, is well hydrated, or has consumed hard alcohol versus beer are also taken into account when measuring how long alcohol can stay in the system. The reason is that all of these factors dictate how fast alcohol can be absorbed by the body.\nThere are a number of tests, which can detect alcohol in the system over different periods of time. How long does alcohol stay in your blood? Breathalyzers can detect alcohol in the blood within 24 hours of drinking. How long does alcohol stay in your urine? Urine tests can detect alcohol in the system for days after moderate drinking; and a saliva test is able to detect alcohol in the body for nearly two weeks after alcohol consumption.\nFor alcohol to be present in your system for longer lengths of time, consider the amount that was consumed, the time in which it was consumed, and how fast the body was able to process it. Everyone’s body is different, making it difficult to universally answer the question how long does alcohol stay in urine or blood?\nHow Is Alcohol Processed Through the Body?\nApproximately 20 percent of alcohol is absorbed through the stomach before moving directly to the bloodstream, while the remaining 80 percent is absorbed through the small intestine. When a person’s blood alcohol concentration exceeds .055, the blood and tissue begins to take on excess amounts. At this rate of consumption, the negative effects of alcohol begin to increase. The initial feelings of happiness or relaxation can quickly change to anxiousness or disorientation.\nGenerally speaking, the liver can break down one drink per hour. This translates to a 12-oz. beer, 5-oz. pour of wine, or 1.5 oz. of hard liquor. Again, absorption into the body is affected by varying factors, such as eating.", "score": 0.871868372, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:0100cb65-7606-4375-9590-77ccd4974eb5>", "text": "How Long Does Alcohol Stay In Your System?\nHow long does alcohol stay in your system is an important question.

A small amount of alcohol can impair judgment and the ability to operate a motor vehicle safely.\n- The legal limit for driving is .08% BAC or above.\n- Receiving a DWI conviction could mean going to prison for years.\nDetermining blood alcohol content (BAC) depends primarily on the amount of alcohol consumed over the time spent drinking.\nAlcohol metabolizes at a rate between .012% to .015% per hour.\nBlood Alcohol Content\nBAC is the unit of measurement of how much alcohol is in someone’s body (percentage in the blood) at any given moment. BAC is still considered the primary standard for alcohol testing in some labs.\n- BAC is the grams of ethanol in 100 milliliters of blood.\nGenerally, beer is 4.5% – 5% alcohol for most tests. Wine uses a 5 oz glass, and hard liquor (shots & mixed drinks) uses 1.5 oz at 80 proof.\n- one beer (12 ounces)\n- one glass of wine (5 ounces)\n- 1.5 ounces of liquor (shot)\nUse the quick calculator to determine the approximate BAC when a person quits drinking.

Enter it in the top line reading “Number of Drinks Consumed.”\n- Determine how many hours were spent drinking, and round up to the nearest half-hour. Enter it in the second line reading the “Number of hours Spent Drinking.\nQuick BAC Calculator\nThese results are calculations based on the average rate of human alcohol metabolization.

It depends on a variety of factors including a person’s height, weight, age, and gender. It matters how much of a drug a person ingests, how long they’ve been using it, and the strength of the drug. There is not a set formula to determine how long drugs will remain in the body, but rather a range of time of expectancy.\nTesting is a determining factor since different tests can detect drugs at different time frames. How long do drugs stay in urine? For example, a hair screening may detect drugs months after use, while a urine sample generally can detect drug use for up to a few days. The types of tests that may be used for drug testing include:\nBreath test. This is most commonly used to detect alcohol levels and intoxication. Nearly 90 percent of alcohol is processed through the liver, but the remainder is eliminated through the urine and breath, which can be detected within a couple of hours.\nBlood test. Blood tests can detect alcohol levels for up to 24 hours after drinking. They are used to test concentration levels of both alcohol and drug use.\nUrine test.

Such pre-engineered target sequences may be introduced by genome editing or modification. As an example, a genetically modified plant variety is generated using “custom” or engineered endonucleases such as meganucleases produced to modify plant genomes (see e.g., WO 2009/114321; Gao et al.

We review the exploitations of spontaneous and induced mutations in crop husbandry and genetic improvement. The advances made in the uses of contemporary scientific and technological methodologies to enhance the efficiency of the induction, detection and deployment of induced mutations are also explored. We also provide perspectives for facilitating the integration of induced mutations in plant breeding programs.\nMutation is the heritable change to the genetic material; individuals that manifest modified characteristics on account of heritable changes are known as mutants. In nature, the combinations of the errors that occur during the replication of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and damages to this hereditary material on account of an individual’s exposure to sunlight and ultra-violet (UV) radiation and diseases lead to heritable changes to the genetic blueprint. Other types of mutations include duplications whereby whole parts of the genome are doubled and translocations whereby a part of a chromosome is transferred to a non-homologous chromosome; these occur as a result of errors during meiotic cell division. Their effects depend on whether or not, and how, genes are affected in such mutations. The accumulations of such aberrations have been the primer for evolution and speciation.\nStretches of DNA make up the basic unit of heredity, the gene. The subtle changes to DNA sequences are the most useful for crop improvement as the more gross alterations (at the chromosomal and cellular levels) invariably confer some levels of unfitness and even lethality. One way for classifying mutations at the DNA sequence level is to categorize the mutation on the basis of how the modification affects the gene’s ability to synthesize the protein that it is responsible for. In general, the mutations that are important in crop improvement usually involve single bases and may or may not affect protein synthesis.\n2.1.

These plants have been modified in the laboratory to enhance desired traits such as increased resistance to herbicides or improved nutritional content. The enhancement of desired traits has traditionally been undertaken through breeding, but conventional plant breeding methods can be very time consuming and are often not very accurate. Genetic engineering, on the other hand, can create plants with the exact desired trait very rapidly and with great accuracy. For example, plant geneticists can isolate a gene responsible for drought tolerance and insert that gene into a different plant. The new genetically-modified plant will gain drought tolerance as well. Not only can genes be transferred from one plant to another, but genes from non-plant organisms also can be used. The best known example of this is the use of B.t. genes in corn and other crops. B.t., or Bacillus thuringiensis, is a naturally occurring bacterium that produces crystal proteins that are lethal to insect larvae. B.t. crystal protein genes have been transferred into corn, enabling the corn to produce its own pesticides against insects such as the European corn borer. For two informative overviews of some of the techniques involved in creating GM foods, visit Biotech Basics (sponsored by Monsanto) http://www.biotechknowledge.monsanto.com/biotech/bbasics.nsf/index or Techniques of Plant Biotechnology from the National Center for Biotechnology Education http://www.ncbe.reading.ac.uk/NCBE/GMFOOD/techniques.\nWhat Are Some of the Advantages of GM foods?\nThe world population has topped 6 billion people and is predicted to double in the next 50 years. Ensuring an adequate food supply for this booming population is going to be a major challenge in the years to come. GM foods promise to meet this need in a number of ways:\nCrop losses from insect pests can be staggering, resulting in devastating financial loss for farmers and starvation in developing countries.

The best time to plant fescue grass (Festuca spp.) Most homeowners will need to reseed areas that were lost because of heat or disease - … Overseeding is spreading grass seed over an existing lawn. Caring For a New Lawn When Should I Plant My Grass Seed? In the years since, many new lawn varieties of tall fescue, known as turf-type and dwarf-type tall fescues, have been developed. This seems somewhat difficult to justify when water is such a precious resource in Arizona.

However, please remember that each shade situation is unique and might require some equally unique attention.\nAfter establishment, GTF Tall Fescue needs approximately 1 inch of water per week, either from natural rainfall or irrigation. In shady areas this grass will not need as much water. However, for soils with heavy sand content, it’s possible that the grass will need more than 1 inch per week because the soil won’t hold enough moisture.\nTall Fescue requires a low to medium nitrogen application with 2-4 pounds per 1000 square feet of actual Nitrogen per year in most situations. This amount should be separated into three applications throughout the growing season. Please visit our website for proper fertilization instructions.\nDuring the more aggressive growing months, this grass needs to be mowed once every 1 to 2 weeks. The prime growing/mowing height is between 2“ and 3″. Remember that you should not cut more than 1/3 of a grass blade off in any one mowing, in order to minimize the stress on the grass.

It can encourage disease, because the grass stays wet and the air is usually stagnant, and these conditions usually favor most disease fungi, especially powdery mildew.\nThe first thing you can do is to choose disease resistant varieties. Increase the air flow through the area by trimming and thinning shrubs. Reduce the shade by trimming lower branches and thinning upper ones. Since photosynthesis is reduced, grass in the shade need all the surface area it can get, so mow 1/2 to 1 inch higher than your normal turf. Grass also faces competition from trees for moisture and nutrients, so increase fertilizers by 1/2, and deeply water regularly, making sure to stop watering by 2:00 p.m. so the water has time to evaporate before sundown.\nSHOPPING FOR SEED\nWhen buying grass seed, you get what you pay for.

It won’t form turf as thick as other grasses in the South. Buffalograss is a growing interest for low-maintenance lawn areas. It can survive extreme drought conditions, has low fertility requirements, and when left unmowed, it will usually not grow by more than 4 to 5 inches. Yet buffalograss has little resistance to the darkness.\nSome recent varieties of buffalograss, such as Prairie, Buffalawn, and 609 are only available as sod. A increasing number of varieties known as seeds are available, including Comanche, Texoka, Plains and Topgun. Buffalograss isn’t suitable for everyone, nor for many lawn areas. But its drought tolerance and low maintenance requirements in the upper south and semi-arid regions have increased interest among many homeowners. The best height to mow is 2 inches.\nTall Fescue While turf form tall fescue is generally considered a northern, cool seasonal grass, its use is increasing in the upper south, especially on well shaded lawns instead of St. Augustine’s. For the southern summers, tall fescues also have excellent heat and drought tolerance and can withstand cold winter temperatures with very few issues.\nTall fescue is a common species because it remains green, even when dormant, all winter. Using two or more enhanced tall fescues of the turf form as a blend also provides a heartier lawn than using a single older fescue variety such as K-31.\nTall fescue is a bunch of grass, and is usually formed by seeding.

If your desired area is covered in dense tree canopy and the shade never fully breaks, it may be more advantageous to choose a ground cover such as moss or mulch instead of a grass.\nThat being said, there are some cultivars of fine fescue specifically designed for shaded areas that may do better in these conditions with appropriate amounts of maintenance.\nWhen selecting grass for shaded areas, make sure to choose one that is suitable for the climate and amount of sunlight that penetrates the area. It’s also important to maintain the grass with regular watering and fertilizer applications.\nEnsuring proper maintenance will help to ensure that your grass thrives and stays healthy.\nWill tall fescue grow in shade?\nTall fescue can grow in shade but it typically prefers more sun and will not reach its full potential growth rate in shady areas. More importantly, the lack of direct sunlight can result in increased disease susceptibility.\nProperly managed turfgrass in the shade requires more frequent light mowing, fertilizing, and irrigation than turf in full sun. Mowing should be done regularly, but not below the recommended cutting height of 2.5 to 3.\n5 inches. Fertilizer should be applied a few times per year at about 1 pound of nitrogen per 1000 square feet. It is also important to water in the shade more often than turf in full sun because shade slows down the rate of evaporation.\nLastly, tall fescue can be affected by sunscald if the area receives a sudden influx of bright sunlight during the winter. Sunscald can cause discoloration and death of grass blades. For this reason, it is important to shade tall fescue with trees during the winter months.\nWhat is the most shade-tolerant bermudagrass?\nTifGrand Bermudagrass is widely recognized as the most shade-tolerant of all Bermuda grass varieties.", "score": 1.2910850287316947e-06, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:86819eb8-b44c-463c-8808-c9dc41db45de>", "text": "Considering this research and other recent projects completed at OSU, current irrigation recommendations for perennial ryegrass are ¼ inches per application applied two to four times per week depending on weather conditions, with the more frequent applications being made during periods of peak drought stress (August).\nPreliminary research on tall fescue has determined that minimal amounts of irrigation applied once per week can keep tall fescue green while reducing annual bluegrass populations (Figure 3). Current irrigation recommendations for tall fescue are 0.3 inches applied twice a week during the summer months. Early findings from this resasearch also suggested that minimal irrigation of tall fescue will limit encroachment of summer annuals like woodsorrel, spurge, and crabgrass.\nPreliminary findings from this collection of projects suggest that perennial ryegrass and fall fescue stands will have less annual bluegrass when mowed at taller heights (2 to 3 inches), fertilized with moderate levels of nitrogen (2 to 4 pounds N per 1,000 square feet annually), and irrigated a few times per week.

The cause and nature of the faulty development is not exactly certain. It is 4 to 5 weeks after conception that the various organs and different types of muscles and tissues of the body begin to form from layers of cells that separate, divide and fold. One theory suggests that something goes wrong during this early folding and separation, causing the cloacal membrane to fail to close, leaving the bladder outside of the abdominal wall. A second theory proposes that the layer of skin which forms over the bladder at this stage is thin and unable to hold in the bladder. It pulls apart, again leaving the bladder inside out.\nHow is Bladder Exstrophy Diagnosed?\nSometimes exstrophy is diagnosed when a pregnant woman has an ultrasound. The radiologist might notice the bladder is not full. But unborn babies pee often, making the bladder hard to see, and it is easy to miss seeing exstrophy. That is why many babies are diagnosed after they are born. Because the bladder and other structures are exposed on the outer surface of the body, bladder exstrophy is seen right after birth. Sometimes the diagnosis of exstrophy is not made right away, because it is a rare defect that most healthcare providers have not seen before.

Most of the gene products used by the embryo at these stages are already present in the unfertilized egg and were produced by maternal transcription during oogenesis. A small number of gene products, however, are supplied by transcription in the embryo itself. We have focused on these \"zygotically\" active genes because we believe the temporal and spatial pattern of their transcription may provide the triggers controlling the normal sequence of embryonic development.\nThe earliest requirements for zygotic gene activity become apparent at cellularization. The early cleavage divisions in Drosophila involve nuclear mitoses without intervening cytokinesis. Ultimately, they produce a syncytial blastoderm of 6,000 nuclei. \"Cellularization\" of these nuclei requires a massive, rapid reorganization of the embryonic cytoskeleton that occurs after the 13th cleavage cycle.\nThis reorganization is blocked by inhibitors of RNA synthesis such as a-amanitin. By screening a collection of chromosomal deletions that span the entire Drosophila genome, we identified those zygotically active loci required at different stages during cellularization. In embryos deficient for three of these genes, the hexagonal arrays of F-actin required to pull plasma membrane down between adjacent nuclei are abnormal, and multiple nuclei are enclosed into single cells. Other loci affect cytoplasmic clearing, membrane synthesis, and the morphology of contractile rings. We have cloned several of these genes and have characterized their role in restructuring the embryonic cytoskeleton. We have also begun analysis of the role of microtubule- based transport in the early embryo, using optical traps and image enhancement to measure forces and kinetic behaviors of individual cellular organelles. Once the embryo has completed cellularization, it begins gastrulation. A ventral furrow and posterior midgut are formed by characteristic changes in cell shape that occur only in the ventral and posterior regions of the embryo. Our analysis has concentrated on genes (folded gastrulation [=fog] and concertina [= cta]) that are required for the process. Using genetic mosaics, we have shown that fog+ expression is required zygotically and only in specific regions of the embryo.", "score": 2.0738389050452432e-07, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:f40d545b-27f6-478e-8bdb-30b97bc33658>", "text": "In simple terms a blastocyst is an embryo which has been left to develop until day 5 or 6 and presents a complex cellular structure formed by approximately 200 cells.\nDuring conception, the egg is fertilized by sperm in the fallopian tube and an embryo is formed. The embryo usually reaches the uterine cavity about 5 or 6 days after fertilization. At this time, it is a blastocyst, or an embryo made up of hundreds of cells.\nWhen undergoing IVF, a blastocyst is the stage the embryo reaches after 5 days in culture from the egg retrieval. During the three first days of development the embryos start to divide in separate cells, and they are called cleavage embryos. It is only from day 3 to day 5 that the blastocyst is formed.\nWhy are blastocysts important?\nWhile the majority of fertilized eggs will develop into a three-day old embryo, only perhaps 40% of these embryos will develop into a blastocyst. Therefore, blastocysts are considered to be a more “select” group of embryos with a higher chance of pregnancy.\nWhat is the advantage of blastocyst culture?\nSometimes it is not possible to select the best quality embryo(s) to transfer at the day 3 stage. This is because at this stage all the embryos can still look relatively similar and it is impossible to select which embryo is capable of forming a pregnancy over those which are unlikely to. In such circumstances there is a tremendous advantage to let the embryos develop on for another 48 hours and allow them to develop into blastocysts.\nSubsequently, by letting the embryos develop to the blastocyst stage the embryologist will be able to make a better choice of which embryo(s) to transfer back.\nThe blastocyst is a much more complex structure than that of the cleavage embryo. The number of cells has increased to reach over a 100. Under the microscope it is even possible to distinguish the two different cell types that have started to develop. The first of these cell types is known as the Inner Cell Mass (ICM), this is earliest sign of fetal development and is the part of the blastocyst that develops into the baby. The second of the cell types is known as the trophectoderm or trophoblast.

Dreaming is thought to occur primarily in the stage of sleep called Rapid Eye Movement (REM) sleep. This stage of sleep recurs several times in a night of normal sleep. Therefore, dreams occur every night for most individuals. During sleep, we transition through several stages in a regular recurring pattern. These stages can be broadly classified into REM and non-REM sleep. Therefore, normal sleep cycles through these stages throughout the sleep period. Individuals usually have REM sleep roughly every 90 minutes on average.\nAbnormal activity during sleep is called parasomnia. These abnormal activities can occur in both REM and non-REM sleep and therefore, can be classified into REM and non-REM parasomnias.\nNow back to dreaming.", "score": 5.561866271133027e-10, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:61931784-86c3-42d3-b888-b2dd1677b573>", "text": "In H. pulcherrimus, founder blastomeres of pigment lineage are specified after occurrence of the 9th cleavage (Kominami, 1998). Also in L. variegatus, SMC lineage is specified around the 9th cleavage (McClay et al., 2000). The treatment during 7–10 hr, which included the period of pigment cell specification, increased the number of pigment cells remarkably. However, the most effective period of LiCl treatment spanned from the 4th to 7th hr of development (Fig. 2). It is naturally supposed that effect of LiCl is retained in the treated embryos for a few hours after treatment.\nDifferentiation processes of SMC-derived cells seem to be divided into three phases. The first phase spans from 16- to 60-cell stage. Interaction between micro- and macromeres during this period is indispensable for the differentiation of meso-endodermal tissues. Deprivation of micromeres from the embryo at these stages causes decrease in the total amount of the meso-endodermal tissues (Ransick and Davidson, 1993, 1995). This decrease is no more rescued by the recombination with micromere progeny during later stages (Sweet et al., 1999). Treatment with LiCl during this period may enhance the competence or susceptibility of veg2 blastomeres to the induction signal that is emanated from the micromere progeny. Probably, this enhancement is brought about with the LiCl-induced close cell contact between the descendants of macromeres and micromeres (Livingston and Wilt, 1990; Khaner and Wilt, 1991).

The best method of checking fat percentages is by using fat% calipers and the jackson pollock method of 7 skinfold pinch sites. (your trainer SHOULD offer this service!) These sites include the chest, tricep, upper back, abdominal area, hip area, thigh and on your side just below your bra strap.\nI use this method with all of my clients as many of them in the first 4 weeks DO NOT loose body weight but LOOSE BODY FAT!!! When you do get your fat percentage measured make sure that the person measuring you is qualified and measures more than just one skinfold site!!\nI always suggest with my clients that we take measurements every 4 weeks – and to get the most accurate fat percentage measurement you must be well hydrated!!\nSometimes non loss of weight can be a hard concept to grasp for some people as many people immediately think that you instantly loose weight when you start to exercise. This is very often NOT the case! AND PLEASE BELIEVE ME!!! Most of my time with new clients is spent trying to explain that muscle weighs 3 times more than fat and jumping on the scales and watching your body weight is not a good measurement of how your body is changing through the effects of training!! Monitoring your fat percentage and amount of lean body mass you have is MUCH BETTER!!\nAs for the inclusion of aerobic activity that is always a great idea for women with PCOS to accompany HIGH REPETITION (about 20 each set) weight training. 30 minutes of steady aerobic activity AFTER your workout may make you feel very good and jump start your fat burning.", "score": 0.855497122, "source": "dense"}]}

When performed correctly, they can add pounds of muscle to your upper body and also improve your strength for other exercises such as bench presses and military presses. To make sure you get maximum benefit from your weighted dips, your technique must be perfect, and you must program them correctly in your training routine.\nFormer champion bodybuilder, Vince Gironda, was a huge fan of dips for building muscle -- so much so that in his gym, he replaced all the bench presses with dipping stations. While weighted dips always hit your chest, triceps and shoulder muscles to some degree, the way you perform them can change which muscle group is emphasized most. Using a narrow grip with an upright torso keeps most of the focus on your triceps, while a wider grip with your weight shifted forward targets your chest more.\nAim to start and finish each repetition with your elbows locked out. Your descent should take around two to three seconds, as the eccentric or downward phase of an exercise is where most muscle breakdown occurs. Maximize this breakdown with a slow descent. Make sure your biceps are slightly below parallel to the floor in the bottom position, then explode back up.\nYou can use different dipping bars to add some variety into your training. Try switching between straight and V-shaped bars or use thick bars, which will challenge your grip and forearm muscles more. Change the way you add weight. While most people will choose to add weight on a dipping belt around their waist, there's no reason why you can't use a weighted vest or hold a dumbbell between your feet. Changing the angle of your elbows is another way to give yourself a new dipping challenge.\nBefore attempting weighted dips, you need to master bodyweight dips. Once you can do 15 repetitions with your bodyweight, you can try adding weight. Strength coach JP Carlson recommends setting an initial goal of working up to 50 percent of your bodyweight added for five reps. When you've accomplished that, move on to 100 percent of your bodyweight added for five reps. Do one session of heavy-weighted dips in the three- to five-rep range every week, and do one lighter session of 10 to 12 reps.", "score": 0.8272365482264954, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:7f44deab-c800-4393-89b7-357f88c1afaa>", "text": "In level 2 we start to move away from parallette dips and up to static dips. Static dips follow the same movement pattern as dips but on a different apparatus. They are easier because you do not need to stabilize your body across a 360 plane on two rings.\nEven though static dips will be the main focus we will start on the rings in level 2. The reason for that is to get you accustomed to holding yourself on the rings, which is a skill in and of itself.\nAt first, you likely won’t be able to hold yourself unassisted. What I recommend is to lower the rings down to thigh level. This will allow you to hold yourself on the rings while your feet are on the ground. Once hanging you can slowly start putting more weight on your hands on the rings and less on your feet on the ground. This is done by moving to your tiptoes on both feet. Once that becomes too easy then only your tiptoes on one foot. Eventually, you will be able to lift that off the ground and support yourself.\nSELF-ASSISTED STATIC DIP PROGRESSION – DEMO\nThe self-assisted dip should be performed on a static dip mount. If your gym does not have one, you can put two GHD’s close together and use the handles.\n- Slow (3-4 seconds) and assistance on the way up and down. Gradually use your legs less to make it more difficult.\n- Slow (3-4 seconds) and no assistance on the way down. Assistance on the way up.\n- Slow (3-4 seconds) and no assistance on the way down with 1-3 second pause at the bottom before using your legs to help you get back up.\n- Normal pace down (1-2 seconds) and back up with no assistance.\n- Bodyweight dip + weight. Only start adding weight once you can do 5 strict bodyweight dips. Move up in 2.5lb or 5lb increments.\nLEVEL 2 INSTRUCTIONS\n- Current ability: 8-10 parallette dips with legs on the bench. 25lb for women and 45lb on laps for men.\n- Goal: 3-5 static strict dips.

This machine uses weight to counterbalance your bodyweight, making it easier to finish.\nMy favorite part about dips for chest is that they’re easy to do. Despite the drawbacks of your bodyweight as the max, there are weights in the machine that make it easier for you.\nDips are hard to do, and most people can’t do too many of them with their full bodyweight. Besides the chest, they also work your triceps pretty intensely.\nPushups are another very common exercise, even among those who don’t lift. The suspension pushup has its differences from regular pushups, but the actions are very similar.\nThese pushups require some type of strap, usually canvas or rubber, and something to attach them to. Being more complicated than regular pushups, they come with benefits.\nSuspension pushups strengthen the core as well as the pectorals, allowing more muscle groups to be worked. Although these are beneficial, they have downsides.\nThey may be difficult for beginners to attempt as it requires more muscles, causing shaking of the body when you put weight on the straps. A lifter can overcome this by building strength with other exercises first, or simply dealing with the shaking.\nAnother drawback is that suspension pushups require extra equipment. Most lifts can be completed with bodyweight, dumbbells or barbells, but these require straps, which not every gym will have.\nFurther complications include the need for somewhere to set up the straps, in order to complete the exercise. Not every gym will have this required space.\nWhile suspension pushups may prove difficult to set up, they’re worth it if you can find the equipment and space.\nSince suspension pushups are harder to set up, I found a great video on how to do them. The last thing you’d want to do while trying to get a bigger chest is hurting yourself, so make sure that you’re doing it right.\nWeighted pushups are a simple concept; a pushup with added weight. The weight could be a plate or a weight vest. Traditional push-ups are limited to your bodyweight.

This makes it ideal for beginners who are not yet strong enough, people with heavier bodyweight, or experienced gym-goers as part of a mechanical drop set.\nSuspension Trainer Skull Crushers\nStability fitness equipment like TRX straps or gymnastic rings increases the level of difficulty and muscle engagement of bodyweight skull crushers. This variation will demand more core and scapulohumeral stability – making it a great exercise for improving athletic-type upper body movements.\nFloor Skull Crushers\nThis is a hard version of our featured tricep-building exercise because you’re almost using all your body weight while executing the movement. But, it does have a limiting factor – the range of motion. This is a great calisthenics and gymnastics exercise.\nBodyweight Skull Crusher Alternatives\nBesides skull crushers, here are other bodyweight exercises you can do to train your triceps:\nDiamond or close grip push-ups\nThe skull crusher movement isolates the triceps, making them the lone movers in the exercise. However, if you’re looking for a compound push bodyweight exercise with a focus on the triceps, do diamond push-ups. It trains the chest and shoulders while emphasizing the triceps.\nTricep chair dips\nTricep Chair Dips is a great exercise to bias the largest head of the triceps. The triceps’ long head pulls the humerus down and back past the frontal plane of the body. And this motion is trained in the chair dips.\nFor calisthenics or bodyweight training, Bar Dips are by far the best push-based movement.

This has been concluded through years and years of research by numerous strength coaches. Below is the gist of it based on a 200 pound 1RM in the bench press\nBench press 1RM: 200\nSupinated chin-up (palms face you): Your goal would to be around 87% of your 1RM in the bench press\nExample: 200 x .87 = 174lbs.\nThis includes your body weight plus any extra weight added. So if you weigh 150 pounds you would be including roughly a 25 pound dumbbell, weight plate, vest, or whatever other method you use to add extra weight.\nIncline bench press: Your goal would be to be around 91% of your 1RM in the bench press\nExample: 200 x .91 = 182lbs.\nDips: (Only perform dips if you have VERY healthy shoulders) Your goal is to be at 117% of your 1RM in the bench press.\nExample: 200 x 1.17 = 234lbs\nFor dips as in pull-ups this weight includes your bodyweight.\nThere are some other calculations that you can take into account for smaller muscle groups. If you are at all interested in those please contact me and I will ship them out to you. And by ship I mean email.\nWhy are these beneficial? Well if you can bench press 2 times your body weight but can barely knock out a pull-up with a little extra weight you may need to work on that to balance out those muscles. It makes a huge difference in injury prevention.\nOur muscles work together. If your chest is super strong but your back is weak it pulls on those muscles, thus risking injury.\nIn all honesty testing your strength and 1 rep max should be a fun learning experience.

An improved understanding of the cycling and fate of oceanic organic carbon will not only allow for better prediction of how these processes may change in the future, but it will help underpin the societal value of these ocean ecosystem services. The EXport Processes in the Ocean from RemoTe Sensing (EXPORTS) field campaign aims to provide answers to these questions.\nThe goal of EXPORTS is to develop a predictive understanding of the export and fate of global ocean net primary production (NPP) and its implications for the Earth’s carbon cycle in present and future climates (oceanexports.org). To develop this quantitative understanding, EXPORTS will measure and model the export pathways that remove fixed organic carbon from the upper ocean and drive the attenuation of these vertical fluxes within the ocean interior. EXPORTS datasets will be used to develop and test numerical predictive and satellite-data diagnostic models of NPP fates and their carbon cycle impacts. EXPORTS builds on decades of NASA-funded research on developing and validating satellite data-driven models of regional to global NPP and hence, EXPORTS will contribute to NASA’s upcoming Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud and ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission.\nA Brief History of EXPORTS\nThe NASA EXPORTS field campaign is the result of an initial open competition in 2012 by the NASA Ocean Biology and Biogeochemistry (OBB) Program to identify scoping workshops for future field campaigns. This was followed by many years of committee-based planning, community vetting of science and implementation plans, and final peer review. The NASA EXPORTS Science and Implementation Plans were made publicly available by the NASA OBB program. In February 2016, the National Science Foundation held the Biology of the Biological Pump (BoBP) workshop aimed in part to leverage NASA’s planned investment in the EXPORTS field program. In August 2016, NASA announced it would support data mining and observational system simulation experiment (OSSE) projects to help with planning the NASA EXPORTS field campaign and five projects were funded under this pre-EXPORTS call.", "score": 0.861189365, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:55b8a973-6f29-4d48-9c58-c522c3ac9978>", "text": "The planning of the EXPORTS field campaign is well underway. The first field deployment is planned to take place in the summer of 2018 in the Northeast Pacific, while the tentative second cruise will be in the North Atlantic Ocean in the spring of 2020. NASA has formed a project office staffed of Agency and EXPORTS PIs to direct EXPORTS’ progress. The EXPORTS Science Team, which comprises the funded PIs, is participating on near-weekly teleconferences, and co-chief scientists have been selected. An initial EXPORTS kickoff meeting was held in September 2017 in the Washington, DC area. There, the PIs organized themselves into working groups focused on creating short methodological descriptions for each measurement to be made. This documentation will be critical for the metadata, the project data management, and for ensuring legacy of the program through a set of NASA Technical Memoranda. This has also proven to be an excellent way to foster cross-project collaborations. A second PI meeting is scheduled for mid-February 2018, leveraging the upcoming Ocean Sciences Meeting.\nEXPORTS First Field Deployment\nThe first EXPORTS field deployment will be to the Northeast Pacific Ocean in late summer 2018. Two ships, the R/V Roger Revelle and the R/V Sally Ride, will be deployed for 27 days of coordinated sampling around Station P (50°N 145°W), while EXPORTS’ autonomous component will ensure a longer-term presence. The choice of Station P as an anchor point for the field campaign was made based on results from the data mining and OSSE projects and the availability of a long-term data set for this site, as well as the many sampling partnerships afforded by ongoing programs. Canada’s Line P long-term hydrographic/biogeochemistry program has been running since 1949, and they currently conduct three annual transect cruises from British Columbia to Station P. Other useful partnerships include NOAA Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory’s (PMEL) air-sea interaction buoy and the NSF’s Ocean Observatories Initiative’s (OOI) global node at Station P.\nThe EXPORTS 2018 field deployment will comprise four basic components (depicted in Figure 1 above). First, several autonomous vehicles will be deployed before the ship observations.", "score": 0.849118531, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:55b8a973-6f29-4d48-9c58-c522c3ac9978>", "text": "In early 2017, NASA released a call for proposals for the EXPORTS field program and the competition for inclusion on the NASA EXPORTS Science Team and its leadership. The call also included the implementation approach for the EXPORTS field program, with two major cruises to collect in situ data, followed by a synthesis and analysis phase to be competed in the future. At the same time, NSF released a Dear Colleague Letter (DCL) stating they would consider proposals that leveraged the NASA investment with objectives that supported the BoBP plan. From the NASA competition, 11 projects were selected for support (Table 1). Three NSF proposals have been recommended for support (at the time of this writing, the awarding of these grants is not yet official), bringing the count to a total of 41 PIs and co-PIs that are supported by NASA and NSF on EXPORTS/BoBP. This level of investment likely makes EXPORTS the largest coordinated U.S.-funded biogeochemical field program since the Joint Global Ocean Flux Study (JGOFS) nearly 2 decades ago. Table 1 lists the funded projects, PI, and co-PIs, project titles, and links to two page descriptions for each project.\nAny implementation of the EXPORTS field program must result in the quantification of the major export pathways that remove fixed organic carbon from the upper ocean and sequester it at depth. NASA is uniquely poised, given the global vantage point of space-based observations, to use Earth observing satellite data to meet this objective, while also understanding observational requirements for future advanced Earth Observing missions. Quantification of major carbon export pathways requires the simultaneous measurement of 1) sinking particle fluxes (and their composition), 2) the export of organic carbon to depth via vertically migrating zooplankton, and 3) the vertical transport of dissolved and suspended particulate organic carbon to depth, where it is remineralized by different microbial communities. To develop predictive links to satellite ocean color-retrievable parameters, the quantification of export pathways must be augmented by research programs focused on, but not limited to, the elucidation of plankton community structure, rates of NPP and grazing, and optical oceanography. Complicating this further is the stochastic nature of export flux determinations that necessitates a fully four-dimensional sampling design while maintaining a long-term perspective. This reasoning led to the Agency selection of projects listed in Table 1.", "score": 0.84120357, "source": "dense"}]}

In the years since, Black Lives Matter has grown into a movement with international recognition and power. It’s always important to remember that Black Lives Matter is a movement but also a political ideology and a complex web of organizations. The movement has inspired millions to protest police violence. The ideology has influenced American politics for the last decade, and the organizations have pushed for social justice and policy.\nNow, one of those core groups, the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, is the subject of a recent report about its finances, specifically its purchase of a $6 million home in Malibu, California, under the guidance of the group’s former leader, Patrisse Cullors, ostensibly as both a safe house and as a space to film social media videos. The story, published in New York magazine, has fueled questions about the foundation’s judgment and whether it’s still a credible voice in the BLM movement. On Friday’s episode of A Word, I spoke with investigative journalist Sean Campbell, the reporter behind the story. This conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\nJason Johnson: When you tried to talk to the founders of the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, how receptive were they to talk to you? How did people respond when you wanted to reach out, and what did you tell them you were writing about?\nSean Campbell: They were not receptive at all, I would say, especially early on. So I learned about the home purchase. I had learned that a man named Dyane Pascall had purchased the home. Dyane Pascall was a financial manager for Patrisse Cullors’ consulting firm and also [for] the father of her child. I was like, well, this seems odd. This is a nearly $6 million purchase in cash. The person at question was not the kind of person who would just have $6 million lying around, so things seemed strange there.\nI asked them questions.

It provides a friendly, comfortable environment in which to take a break, watch a movie on big-screen TVs, play video games, check email or use the Internet, select a book or magazine to read, make a phone call, or just grab a cup of coffee. Wounded Warriors and their Family Members visit the WFSC to maintain contact with other military members or extended Family Members, to receive emotional support, answers to their questions, and to extend their rehabilitation away from the hospital. The rehabilitation involves learning to cope with war related disabilities as individuals, as couples, and as families.\nBackground: As the Global War on Terrorism continued, seriously injured Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Marines were evacuated from the theater of operations to major medical facilities located on military installations. Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC) is one of the world's best trauma centers and many of these Wounded Warriors receive their medical care there. Due to the seriousness of their injuries, these Wounded Warriors remain at BAMC for an extended period of time which, in many cases, exceeds 12 months. BAMC physicians noticed a need for Family Members to be intimately involved in the rehabilitation of their Wounded Warrior, and that a vital part of his/her recovery meant a need to have a \"safe\" environment away from the hospital. On the physician's initiative, the concept of the Warrior and Family Support Center was developed, led by Army Community Service, and authorized by the Fort Sam Houston (FSH) Garrison Commander.

The SFAC, in addition to its use as a counseling center for individuals, groups and families, features a gathering space in a large, relaxing, living room style area with a central fireplace for leisure activity and enjoyment.\nThe SFAC also has a child activity space that is designed for children from infants to grade school, complete with play structure and swings. The Barracks consists of sixteen apartments; all are ADA and UFAS compliant, eight are 2-bedroom, 2-bath units, and eight 2-bedroom units. All three buildings are single-level facilities with multiple entry points to minimize travel between them. The site plan is designed around a large open courtyard central to all three facilities, which will include outdoor leisure spaces for summer gatherings.\nThe Warriors in Transition Complex achieved LEED certification at the Silver level by employing the following elements: reduced air infiltration using a\nStructural Insulated Panel (SIP) wall system; built on a previously developed site; installed high performance mechanical heating systems; reduced water usage; and maximized open space on site.", "score": 0.839181125, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:f9fc71b3-795f-4865-baf1-c246bdd3b278>", "text": "The WFSC on FSH is the only one of its kind, offering a safe environment for military families to reconnect following military operations and restart their lives with the full support of the military community.

The Returning Heroes Home Project designed the new Warrior and Family Support Center with a \"living room\" environment, to provide all the comforts of home while the Wounded Warriors and their Families are so far away from their own. This dedicated building includes a large social gathering area, kitchen facilities, a dining room, a learning facility for computerized training, a private counseling room, a business center with high speed internet access, a game room, and large open front and back porch areas. It was designed with Wounded Warriors' requirements in mind - fully wheelchair-accessible, with an atmosphere that encourages healing. It retains the same \"closeness\" that was found in the previous center that allowed Wounded Warriors and their Families to be in close contact with each other. In this setting, Wounded Warriors and Families are able to comfort and support each other by drawing upon their shared experiences for strength and understanding.\nEvents: The WFSC schedules over 100 activities each month. The Wounded Warriors and their Family Members have the opportunity to attend sporting events, movies, plays at the Majestic Theatre, concerts, the San Antonio Stock Show & Rodeo, Fiesta, shopping trips, luncheons and dinners, Bingo, fishing trips, and much more. All events and trips are free of charge. » Calendar\nResources: The WFSC Staff Members will provide Wounded Warriors and their Family Members with a welcome packet containing information on Fort Sam Houston and the surrounding community, maps, calling cards, and a guided tour of the Center.

Investigators hypothesized that human dermal papillae also could be induced to generate new hair follicles. Gene-expression analysis showed that the three-dimensional cultures used in the experiments restored 22% of normal gene expression, less than expected but sufficient to cause hair growth.\n-- Charles Bankhead\nLung Cancer Drug Resistance in Sights\nNext-generation drugs hold promise against treatment resistance in lung cancer, preclinical studies showed.\nAn investigational third-generation epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor -- AZD9291 -- overcame the mutation that undermines erlotinib (Tarceva) and gefitinib (Iressa) response in most patients. The drug shrank non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) until it disappeared in mice with activating or resistance EGFR mutations or both.\nIn a second cell assay and animal model study, the investigational agent PF-06463922 blocked all known ALK-gene resistance mutations to crizotinib (Xalkori) and passed through the blood-brain barrier to reach brain metastases.\nBoth pharmaceutical company-funded studies were reported at the American Association for Cancer Research International Conference on Molecular Targets and Cancer Therapeutics meeting in Boston.", "score": 0.827644765, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:e116086a-4e50-428a-94f8-d8c7fbbf7521>", "text": "Will Recent Advances in Hair Science Put Hair Transplant Clinics Out of Business?\nHair transplant clinics have been experiencing a tremendous rise in popularity and patient numbers in recent years, which is mainly due to improvements in the hair surgery techniques they use. Today's hair transplants can give you a completely natural look, particularly thanks to the advent of follicular unit extraction technology. But all hair transplantation techniques face one constraint - a limited supply of donor hair. The maximum number of grafts that can be transplanted is, depending on the individual's hair density in the donor area, between 10,000 and 12,000, which numbers about 20,000 - 24,000 hairs. A full head of hair is about 100,000 hairs. But there is the possibility that this weakness could be finally overcome in the not too distant future. The easiest solution to this problem would be a pill or a topical solution but, despite significant advances in the development of novel medicinal drugs and promising genetic research into telomeres, the ultimate oral or topical cure for baldness is not expected to emerge within the next ten years. However, there are some promising technologies that might become commercially available within about six to seven years.\nHair multiplication is one of them. It is often referred to as hair cloning or follicular neogenesis. It consists of the culturing and multiplying of cells that come from hair follicles which have been extracted from the donor area at the back of the head and injecting these cultivated dermal papilla cells into the bald scalp where they are expected to induce new hair growth. The second promising line of development involves generating new hair follicles in wounds of hair-free skin. Both of these methods might be good for generating new hair follicles in bald areas but they may not be so good when it comes to controlling the thickness and the shade of newly-grown hair and the direction of its growth. Therefore, seeding follicle implants into the frontal area of the scalp will probably remain necessary. In addition, both of these new techniques are expected to be performed at hair transplant clinics. Although some hair transplant surgeons may sound sceptical when it comes to commenting on recent advances in these new techniques, they might, in the future, become their greatest providers, as the popularity of hair surgery gets a further boost due to the unlimited supply of donor hair. The benefit to the consumer, besides the unlimited supply of donor hair, should be that the quality should correspond to the best that hair surgery technology has to offer today but at a lower price.", "score": 0.827448666, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:1bc005f0-4ac9-41a0-b0e6-63444a8cfec4>", "text": "At Hair Professionals, we love technology.

Contact us at firstname.lastname@example.org or call (424) 253-0165 for easy ways to find out if your hair folicles are alive.\nWhy do we need Mesenchymal Stem Cells for hair growth?\nWe need more stem cells as we age, but our body is using them up. When we are infants, we have the most stem cells that we will ever have and then by the time we grow up to bone maturity, we only have 10% of these cells left. Only 10% and that is all we have left to work with for the rest of our lives. Cells die off as we age and that percentage goes down even further every year. Your hair folicles are greatly effected by fewer stem cells in your system. The earlier you can get Stem Cell Hair Restoration the better.\nSo How do Mesenchymal Stem Cells Work for Hair Restoration?\nMesenchymal Stem cells work at Stem Cell Hair Restoration by stimulating the body to regenerate itself. Their magic is not in their ability to become or replace different tissues or cells, but in their production of trophic factors, bioactive molecules produced in response to the environment in which the cells are in. These secreted chemicals aid in repairing tissue and the recruitment of new blood vessels to support nutrient flow to the area and decrease inflammation. By repairing tissue, recruiting new blood vessels and increased nutrient flow your body will start to behave the way it did in your early 20’s. This means hair like a 20 year old. So it is not the cells themselves that work the magic. It is what the cells secrete that has such anti-aging and medicinal potential.\nImmune Response Issues Causing Hair Loss\nYour body is amazing at regenerating and it wants to grow hair. The problem is that damage and scarring occur at the folicle when the immune system doesn’t work exactly like it should from a lack of stem cells. So we get these stem cells into your folicles and they allow the T Cells to protect the area of inflammation, but without attacking the area.", "score": 0.7168055174422875, "source": "sparse"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:9f59598b-1d66-4745-901d-447a607d4f0a>", "text": "I'm watching Dr. Oz and according to him, canola oil penetrates the scalp & hair folicles (I am repeating what he said LoL).

This increase in use has brought greater attention to this section of the Trail, as it passes under the Congress Avenue Bridge.\nThe Trail Bridge at Congress Avenue will update a decades-old bridge and bring a much needed safety enhancement to the area as well as adding a new space to take in the view of Lady Bird Lake. An outdated wooden bridge links the Trail east and west of Congress Avenue under the Ann Richards Bridge. This link takes place around what is a blind and narrow passageway for Trail users and poses a threat to safety for runners or cyclists rounding that corner at speed. The new bridge will enhance pedestrian and bicyclist safety; make the area ADA-accessible; increase the width of the Trail; greatly improve the visual appeal; provide connectivity with the Waller Creek area; create a beautiful site from which to view the Congress Avenue bats; and lower the city’s maintenance costs.\nA sleek and simple design is proposed to minimize visual impact around the Ann Richards Bridge, as well as move users safely and smoothly from east to west. An overlook on the east side of the bridge gives Trail users and bat watchers a safe place to pull off of the Trail, take in the views and connect with Austin. The design also considers the natural function of the site area and seeks to mitigate the impact of its construction here. Upon completion, the new bridge will be 14 feet wide along the north shore of Lady Bird Lake in order to better serve the growing pedestrian and bicycle use.\nFreese & Nichols has already completed the assessment of phase and have been released to do final design and permitting. The Trail Bridge at Congress Avenue is expected to be completed in two years.\n“I am thrilled to support the construction of the new Trail Bridge at Congress Avenue, and I’m excited to work with TTF to bring this important project to fruition,” lead donor Robert Smith said. “Thousands of us who are lucky to call Austin home, and the many visitors to this city, use the Butler Trail at Lady Bird Lake every single day.", "score": 0.818945348, "source": "dense"}, {"doc_id": "<urn:uuid:4f9abd1e-8f0d-449c-a616-5d788ef8f4ba>", "text": "Driftwood Marine Park is well used by local residents as the park links the Saratoga Beach settlement area with Miracle Beach Provincial Park.

For example, when construction equipment and vehicles intrude on a tree's critical root zone without proper protections in place, they can negatively impact the soil environment and endanger the structural integrity of the tree. The GEOPAVE system's load-spreading ability minimizes this by reducing soil compaction and damage to near-surface roots. Additionally, the open-graded aggregate surface allows moisture and precipitation to reach the tree’s roots.\nEasy Installation Allows for Trail Customization\nThe design of the GEOPAVE system allows for easy installation, requiring less site preparation, excavation, and required structural base than other porous pavement systems. The GEOPAVE units come in 20-inch by 40-inch panels, which can easily be cut with ordinary hand tools for installation around obstructions, contours, and irrigation systems. Because of this, the GEOPAVE system was able to accommodate the winding trail through the Rookery Bay Reserve.\nWhen designing the nature observatory trail, the engineer chose to install the GEOPAVE units in an offset pattern, changing the orientation of the units with each row. Either an offset or bricklayer pattern is recommended for pedestrian traffic; however, the pavers can also be arranged in a herringbone pattern if heavier vehicle traffic is anticipated. The crew installed over 15,000 square feet of GEOPAVE pavers directly over the sand subgrade. Depending on the type of loading and the percolation rate of the subgrade, a geotextile separator fabric and a base layer of aggregate can be added underneath the panels. This complete system created a flat, stable surface to support pedestrian traffic, along with occasional traffic from maintenance vehicles.\nFor more information on designing and building permeable recreational trails, visit www.prestogeo.com.
