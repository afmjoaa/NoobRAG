To encourage cats to use the litter box, scoop and change litter daily, rinse the box weekly with baking soda or soap, maintain a shallow litter depth (no more than 2 inches), avoid box liners or lids, place the box in a quiet, low-light area, position it away from food and water dishes, provide one extra litter box per cat, and consider using fluorescein dye for testing."}

During the procedure, a contrast dye is injected to visualize the heart's chambers, valves, and coronary arteries on X-ray images. This helps diagnose conditions such as coronary artery disease, heart defects, and valve issues.\n\nThe procedure is typically performed as an outpatient and can also be used to treat certain heart conditions, such as angioplasty or stenting. Recovery usually involves lying flat for a few hours to prevent bleeding. Patients may need to take blood-thinning medications after the procedure.\n\nTransradial cardiac catheterization is an alternative approach where the catheter is inserted into the radial artery in the wrist, offering a more comfortable recovery and reduced risk of bleeding compared to the traditional femoral artery approach.\n\nBefore the procedure, patients are asked to stop certain medications, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, blood thinners, and some vitamins or dietary supplements, as instructed by their doctor.

It identifies and treats risks beyond insurance coverage, such as reputational damage. Aon's 2010 Global ERM Survey highlighted nine key hallmarks of top-performing ERM programs. Risk management software aids in real-time identification, management, and control of risks. ERM uses structured risk breakdown in multiple dimensions. The framework is crucial for evaluating internal controls, as per the COSO Report, which outlines three goals of an internal control system.

Risk Identification: Recognizing potential events that could impact the achievement of objectives.\n3. Risk Assessment: Evaluating the likelihood and impact of identified risks.\n4. Risk Response: Developing strategies to address risks, including avoidance, mitigation, sharing, or acceptance.\n5. Control Activities: Implementing actions to manage and monitor risks.\n6. Information and Communication: Ensuring relevant information is communicated throughout the organization.\n7. Monitoring and Reporting: Continuously tracking risks and reporting on their status.\n\nERM is not a one-time process but an ongoing cycle that evolves with the organization's needs and external environment. It aims to provide a comprehensive view of risks across the enterprise, enabling better decision-making and risk-adjusted performance.\n\nThe COSO ERM framework defines ERM as a process that involves the board of directors, management, and other personnel, applied across the enterprise to identify, assess, and manage risks to achieve objectives.\n\nKey differences between traditional risk management and ERM include:\n\nContext Document 2: The ERM (Enterprise Risk Management) framework assists managers in addressing business risk by enhancing organizational resiliency, improving decision-making, and supporting a risk-intelligent culture. It identifies and treats risks beyond insurance coverage, such as reputational damage. Aon's 2010 Global ERM Survey highlighted nine key hallmarks of top-performing ERM programs. Risk management software aids in real-time identification, management, and control of risks. ERM uses structured risk breakdown in multiple dimensions.

They have a high level of intelligence, comparable to humans in some aspects, as evidenced by their ability to recognize themselves in mirrors, solve problems, and display self-awareness. Dolphins rely heavily on echolocation for navigation and hunting, especially in murky waters where their vision is limited. They are descendants of terrestrial mammals that returned to the water over 50 million years ago. Dolphins can live up to 80 years, and their age can be determined by examining tooth layers.

Studies suggest it may decrease the risk of various cancers, including skin, lung, mouth, esophagus, stomach, colon, pancreas, bladder, and prostate. It is part of the Camellia sinensis plant family, alongside green, oolong, and white teas. High antioxidant proportions in black tea, including orange pekoe, protect against cellular damage. It may block COX-2 signaling, reverse endothelial dysfunction, and reduce heart disease risk. Green tea, steamed rather than fermented, preserves more polyphenols. EGCG, a polyphenol in green tea, is a potent antioxidant and inhibits urokinase. Different green tea types include young Hysson, gunpowder, dragon well, sancha, and bancha. Black tea, including orange pekoe, is rich in flavonoids and may slow cancer cell spread. Consuming orange pekoe black tea can help fight unhealthy bacteria.\n\nContext Document 2: Orange Pekoe is a grade of black tea from the Camellia sinensis plant. It offers health benefits such as reducing heart attack risk with daily consumption of three or more cups, and combating premature aging.

Rare chimera cats with dramatic facial features, often females, are popular on Instagram. Yana has split facial coloring with green eyes. Most common in females, chimeras require DNA testing for confirmation. \"Split-faced\" or \"two-faced\" cats are rare. Jason Chimera of the Washington Capitals had a gruesome broken nose during a game, missing only six minutes.\n\nContext Document 2: Quimera is a unique kitty with a distinct color pattern on each side of her face, featuring orange with an amber eye on one side and black with a blue eye on the other. The term \"chimera\" refers to a single organism composed of cells from different zygotes, though it's unclear if Quimera is a true chimera.\n\nFamous chimera cats like Venus and Narnia have gained popularity on social media platforms. Venus has a striking two-colored face with orange on one side and black on the other, along with heterochromia (different colored eyes). Narnia, a British Shorthair, has a blue-colored half of her face and black on the other, with both eyes being blue.\n\nChimerism can occur in cats due to the fusion of two embryos in the womb, resulting in a single cat with two sets of DNA. This can lead to differences in coloration and even eye color. While some chimeras have subtle differences, others may have dramatic variations.\n\nChimeras are not a breed but a genetic phenomenon that can happen to any cat, leading to a wide range of personalities and traits. The differences caused by chimerism can be subtle, and a cat's natural coat pattern\n\nContext Document 3: Domestic longhairs have varied fur colors and temperaments, often being more sedate than short-haired counterparts. Early grooming can strengthen the bond between owner and cat. The Wide-band trait in cats is suspected to be recessive. Scottish Folds with folded ear genes may develop congenital osteodystrophy, a severe condition causing symptoms like a thick tail and tender bones. Andreas Steiger lists symptoms such as chondrodystrophy and osteodystrophy in cats with folded ears. The American Shorthair has a rounded body, while Ragdolls are solid-colored with pointed coats. Genetic testing can determine physical features and disease predisposition in cats, but temperament remains a mystery. The Tasman Manx is a curly-haired variant of the Manx breed, recognized by the New Zealand Cat Fancy. American Shorthair cats can test positive for urea cycle enzyme deficiency. Tortoiseshell cats exhibit X chromosome inactivation, seen as a mixture of black and orange fur. Male tortoiseshell cats are often chimeras, being XX/XY in some tissues. Chimerism can occur in various species, including humans, and is studied using techniques like chromosome painting.

{"id": 190, "question": "As a marine biologist studying coral ecosystems, what adaptations allow corals to thrive in the Kermadec waters?", "passages": [{"passage": "Recent research expands knowledge on deep-ocean corals, revealing they possess distinct proteins compared to shallow-water corals, which struggle in low-light conditions. Microbes' role in supporting kelp habitats necessitates further study under changing ocean conditions. Temperature increases can devastate coral reefs. Deep coral physiology and ecosystem characterization are key research focuses, with experiments conducted in laboratories to understand animal biology and ecology. Publications contribute to understanding deep-sea animal life, emphasizing the sunlight dependency of zooxanthellae algae within corals. Sediments affecting sunlight penetration harm polyps, while high temperatures overwhelm heat-protection mechanisms. Acropora digitifera corals rely on intracellular photosynthetic symbionts.

Origami structures and technologies have potential applications in space structures, energy-absorbing structures, and robotics.\n2. Traditional manufacturing methods limit existing origami structures to single materials, hindering the combination of loadability and foldability.\n3. A joint research team from SUSTech and HKU proposed a design and fabrication strategy for origami structures with both foldability and large load capacity.\n4. The rigid-flexible Miura thick-panel origami structure can withstand static loads 11,000 times its own weight and absorb impact energy.\n5. A \"wrapping-based\" multi-material 3D printing method was developed to integrate rigid panels and flexible hinges of origami structures.\n6. This research, \"Multimaterial 3D Printed Self-locking Thick-panel Origami Metamaterials,\" was published in Nature Communications.\n7. The study investigates the use of fully recyclable materials in bending-active tensile hybrid structures, focusing on renewable resources.\n8. Bending-active structures utilize elastic deformation of elements for shape and stiffness.\n9. CNC knitted fabrics are explored for smaller installations to improve stiffness and robustness.\n10. Lightweight structures' environmental impact is significant in evaluating sustainable design.\n\nContext Document 2: Scientists at EPFL have developed an origami-inspired drone that can change shape to minimize collision damage. This drone is stiff enough to carry its own weight and withstand propeller thrust while airborne, but becomes flexible upon impact to absorb shock and reduce damage. The resilience comes from a unique combination of stiff and elastic layers, with an elastomer membrane sandwiched between rigid plates. This technology could lead to applications beyond drones, such as soft-touch grippers. Origami principles are also being applied to create high-performance, flexible lithium-ion batteries and deployable structures for space exploration. Researchers at Arizona State University have created a flexible lithium-ion battery using origami techniques, which can be twisted, bent, and scrunched up multiple times without losing energy capacity or power output. Origami structures are being explored for their potential in creating metamaterials with exotic properties, and for developing deployable systems in engineering and architecture. The EPFL drone's ability to switch between stiff and flexible states showcases the potential of origami-inspired designs in creating adaptive and resilient structures.\n\nContext Document 3: EPFL developed an origami-like drone for collision protection. Researchers at Imperial College London found that origami can protect drones. Dr. Pooya Sareh led the research published in Science Robotics. Origami-based mechanisms can efficiently stow large-area structures. Nondevelopable foldable/unfoldable structures exhibit potential stiffness.

They play a crucial role in flood defense, mosquito control, and supporting marine life. Restoration projects, like the Biscayne Bay Coastal Wetlands Project, aim to improve water flow and salinity balance. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Project (CERP) involves land purchases, aquifer storage systems, and treatment marshes. Marshes in their pioneer stages recover more quickly than mature ones. Tidal restoration leads to rapid changes in plant communities and biogeochemistry, with salt-tolerant species becoming dominant.\n\nContext Document 2: Estuaries protect coastal towns from flooding. High salt marshes have terrestrial plants. Crabgrass control involves preemergent herbicides, targeted removal, proper watering, and maintenance. Anoxic water from breaking sandbars creates toxic environments, causing fish deaths. Sudden wetland dieback occurs in New England. Volunteers plant native species in Ninigret Coastal Salt Pond. Salt marshes are on shallow coasts influenced by tides. Drought affects ecosystems. Seepweed (Suaeda salsa) grows in the region. A valve system lesson was learned. Particulate matter is carried in air at boatyards. Ice cream is made in a baggie through ionic compound breakdown. Milk is the best heat energy source for melting. Edward S. prioritizes fixing Watson’s dike. An aging master teaches about life's pain being pure salt. Aquatic samples are collected, and a brackish bath cleansing system is performed. Extra calcium, like cuttle bone, is beneficial for birds and hermit crabs.\n\nContext Document 3: Salt marshes are tidal wetlands found in the upper coastal intertidal zone, characterized by halophytic vegetation and mud or sand sediments.

The renovation includes restoring the Tea Room's front, creating a new outdoor dining area, and improving service areas. The Huntington, located in Pasadena, CA, is known for its garden and art gallery. It holds historical significance for some, including the author's mother who had her last father-daughter outing with her grandfather there before his passing. The Rose Garden Tea Room offers afternoon tea with a variety of finger sandwiches, salads, cheeses, fruits, and sweets, accompanied by tea. The price is $31 per person, excluding admission. The Huntington also features a new Chinese garden, Liu Fang Yuan, modeled after scholar gardens in Suzhou, China, with a 5-acre lake. The Huntington Library Press, established in 1920, specializes in British and American literature, history, British art, and horticultural topics. The Huntington Library, Art Collections, and Botanical Gardens serves as a research and educational institution.\n\nContext Document 2: The Huntington Library, Art Museum, and Botanical Gardens tea room, located inside the library, is temporarily closed. Outdoor spaces remain open with advance reservations required. The tea room, a 1911 structure designed by architect Myron Hunt, will undergo renovations including upgrading the indoor dining space, modernizing the kitchen, developing new restrooms, and creating a pavilion for exterior dining service. The Huntington expects to complete the project in 2022. The Huntington Library, Art Museum, and Botanical Gardens also features botanical gardens, including a Rose Garden and Japanese Garden, which are open to the public.\n\nContext Document 3: The Tea Room, located in Manchester, offers a traditionally decorated space in a historic building. Kate Helwig, Executive Director of SCNN, praised the Ennan Teahouse for its harmonious design reflecting nature, where warriors would remove their swords and helmets to drink tea together. The building's renovation included moving the library to create Gallery 1: Reformation to Revolution, opening up the top floor for galleries. The Huntington in San Marino features 120 acres of gardens, including a Japanese Garden with a drum bridge, Japanese house, and Bonsai Garden. The MaryLou and George Boone Gallery hosts changing exhibitions. The Japanese Garden is undergoing a centennial restoration with a ceremonial teahouse, tea garden, and waterfall.

As a crucial hub for trade and cultural exchange, Bactria facilitated interactions between East and West. Zhang Qian's journey from China to Bactria in 138 BC was instrumental in discovering the Western Regions and establishing the Silk Roads. Under Greek influence after Alexander the Great's conquests, Bactria became a significant center for trade. The Han Empire further encouraged contact with Bactria through military control, recognizing its importance in connecting China with other empires like the Kushan, Parthian, and Roman Empires. Thus, Bactria's position and historical significance made it a key player in the early establishment of trade relations between China and other civilizations."}
