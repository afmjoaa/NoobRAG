But subtitlers mostly understand what is being said in the video. If a video has idioms, cultural references, or multiple regional dialects then a subtitler will have a better chance of understanding and capturing the meaning of what is being said.\nSo following guidelines on simple things like character counts and line limits frees up space in your head to focus on the real challenges. Reviewing Machine Captions\nAfter you have some experience reviewing subtitles created by another person, you might take on the bigger challenge of reviewing captions created by a machine. More and more, content creators are relying on machine captioning features like auto-generated captions on YouTube videos. It’s often cheaper to use machine captioning than to hire human subtitlers. Human reviewers do make some mistakes: misspelling a brand name, splitting grammatical units, or having too many characters on a line. This gives subtitlers a big advantage over machine captioning. Human subtitlers can make intuitive leaps that machine captioning cannot make. A slight accent or some background noise could result in machine captions that say “two eggs are batter than bun” or something else that could confuse audiences. This is why reviewing machine captioning is more challenging than reviewing human-created subtitles. “Two heads are better than one” becomes more complicated when one of Two heads is not human! As a reviewer, you are the last person between the subtitles and the final audience. And with machine captioning, you are dealing with more mistakes that a human subtitler usually doesn’t make.\nThe corrections that you make will help avoid confusion and frustration for people who need subtitles to enjoy people who need subtitles to enjoy their content's content.

What are the primary reasons this condition develops?", "passages": [{"passage": "What causes diabetes?\nThe causes of diabetes are all too familiar in modern life. When your diet is full of empty calories and an abundance of quickly-absorbed sugars, liquid calories and refined carbohydrates, your cells slowly become resistant or numb to the effects of insulin. You require increasing amounts of insulin to balance your blood sugar levels, which is known as insulin resistance. A high insulin level is the first symptom that you may be developing diabetes. As the problem worsens, your body starts to lose muscle, gain fat, become inflamed and you rapidly age and deteriorate in health. In fact, insulin resistance is the single most important phenomenon leading to not only diabetes but also to rapid and premature aging and related diseases, including heart disease, stroke, dementia and cancer. Nearly all overweight people already have “pre-diabetes” and have significant risks of disease and death. Even those who aren’t overweight can have this problem.\nWhat is Diabetes?\nA chronic disease marked by high levels of blood glucose due to defects\nin insulin production, insulin action, or both. Symptoms of diabetes (hyperglycemia\nor high blood sugar) may include: Increased thirst, frequent urination,\nhunger, fatigue, blurry vision, and slow healing wounds. - Weight loss and increased physical activity may delay or prevent the onset\nof type 2 diabetes.\n- Diabetes is the 7th leading cause of death in the United States. - 2-4% increased risk of heart disease (leading cause of death with Diabetes).\nThere are two main causes of high blood pressure. The first primary, in which the problem is either due to genetic reasons or due to stress. In approximately 90 percent of people, high blood pressure is due to primary causes. In secondary reason, due to the disorder of any other organ, the person becomes prey of high blood pressure. Although high blood pressure is only seen in 10 percent of the population.

Gestational diabetes is a form of diabetes that occurs only during pregnancy. Unlike regular diabetes, Gestational diabetes usually resolves Gestational diabetes once the pregnancy is over. What Causes Gestational Diabetes?\nGestational diabetes is believed to be caused by the hormones from the placenta that help the baby develop.\nIn a normal individual, after consuming a meal, insulin is produced by the pancreas to regulate the blood sugar levels and store excess sugar for future energy requirements. In a person with diabetes, either the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or the insulin receptors are not able to respond to insulin in the manner that the insulin receptors should. What happens is that the hormones from the placenta that help the baby develop block the action of insulin resulting in a condition called \"insulin resistance\". This impairs the mother's's ability to use insulin and the mother's may require as much as three times the amount of insulin to regulate the mother's's blood sugar levels. If the mother's is unable to produce enough insulin, the mother's's blood sugar levels will increase, causing a condition called hyperglycaemia - when there is too much sugar in the blood.\nThat is, if a woman develops diabetes during pregnancy but never had diabetes before, a woman has gestational diabetes. e.\nGestational diabetes is also known as gestational diabetesmellitus and affects about 2-14% of all pregnancies.

Share YOUR Knowledge and Experiences\nor Read Others' Contributions\nClick here for more pages and articles on Diabetes. Diabetes can occur when the pancreas fails to produce any insulin, produces too little insulin, or when the body develops insulin resistance.\nWhat are some common diabetes complications?\nWell, I already mentioned a few of some common diabetes complications but I’ll give you some examples of some others. Let’s take blindness. Blindness most commonly occurs in diabetics either by macular edema which is the outflow of fluid from the blood vessels near the center of the eye (the center of the eye is where we concentrate when we’re reading or looking at an object), the macula can be damaged by leakage of proteins from the bloodstream into the macula, damaging the cells in the macula. So macular edema is one cause of diabetic complications. And I might add, that I have seen patients with macular edema who had chronically elevated blood sugars and when we normalized patients with macular edema who had chronically elevated blood sugars's blood sugars for many months, macular edema who had chronically elevated blood sugars reverses. And when retinologists, which are ophthalmologists who treat the retina, when retinologists, which are ophthalmologists who treat the retina see patients with macular edema who had chronically elevated blood sugars retinologists, which are ophthalmologists who treat the retina can’t believe it, because in retinologists, which are ophthalmologists who treat the retina's experience, macular edema doesn’t reverse, but in my experience, macular edema does. Another cause of blindness is proliferative retinopathy. proliferative retinopathy involves proliferation of microscopic capillaries or blood vessels in the retina, might be in the center of vision or in the periphery, could be anywhere in the retina. microscopic capillaries or blood vessels in the retina are fragile, microscopic capillaries or blood vessels in the retina can be easily broken.

Answer the following question using only the context provided below.\n\n----\nContext Document 1: What causes diabetes?\nThe causes of diabetes are all too familiar in modern life. When your diet is full of empty calories and an abundance of quickly-absorbed sugars, liquid calories and refined carbohydrates, your cells slowly become resistant or numb to the effects of insulin. You require increasing amounts of insulin to balance your blood sugar levels, which is known as insulin resistance. A high insulin level is the first symptom that you may be developing diabetes. As the problem worsens, your body starts to lose muscle, gain fat, become inflamed and you rapidly age and deteriorate in health. In fact, insulin resistance is the single most important phenomenon leading to not only diabetes but also to rapid and premature aging and related diseases, including heart disease, stroke, dementia and cancer. Nearly all overweight people already have “pre-diabetes” and have significant risks of disease and death. Even those who aren’t overweight can have this problem.\nWhat is Diabetes?\nA chronic disease marked by high levels of blood glucose due to defects\nin insulin production, insulin action, or both. Symptoms of diabetes (hyperglycemia\nor high blood sugar) may include: Increased thirst, frequent urination,\nhunger, fatigue, blurry vision, and slow healing wounds. - Weight loss and increased physical activity may delay or prevent the onset\nof type 2 diabetes.\n- Diabetes is the 7th leading cause of death in the United States. - 2-4% increased risk of heart disease (leading cause of death with Diabetes).\nThere are two main causes of high blood pressure. The first primary, in which the problem is either due to genetic reasons or due to stress. In approximately 90 percent of people, high blood pressure is due to primary causes. In secondary reason, due to the disorder of any other organ, the person becomes prey of high blood pressure. Although high blood pressure is only seen in 10 percent of the population. There are no obvious symptoms of high blood pressure. Severe cases of high blood pressure are suspected to be brain hemorrhage, heart attack, kidney failure, eye paralysis etc.\n\nContext Document 2: Who are the folks that are at increased danger of diabetes type 2? Exactly what actually causes diabetes type 2? To your surprise it may be proved that any one at any age could possibly get diabetes type 2. Still the following folks are at an increased risk associated with diabetes type 2\nThose who’ve genetic disposition\nThose who tend to be overweight\nThose who have ever experienced gestational diabetes\nHave given delivery to overweight babies\nThose that lead an inactive lifestyle\nI know that what I will tell you can be incredible, but that’s the truth as well as 100% truth. Diabetes can be managed as well as reversed. I have reversed Diabetes.\nCause of Type 2 Diabetes - Possible Factors\nWhat is the cause of Type 2 Diabetes?\nType 2 Diabetes, affects approximately 90% of the individuals currently diagnosed with diabetes. A note about Cause of Type 2 Diabetes - Possible Factors\nIn natural health and healing, we believe in holistic health and healing, as we realize that different parts of the human body are highly interlinked, often beyond Man's understanding. So, what is the cause of Type 2 Diabetes? In all likelihood, there is no one cause of Type 2 Diabetes, and Type 2 Diabetes occurs due to an interaction of a number of factors, and though Type 2 Diabetes can occur in families, the exact hereditary mechanism and genetic factors that trigger onset remain unknown.\nUnlike Type 1 diabetes, people with Type 2 Diabetes do produce insulin; however, people with Type 2 have trouble either producing insulin in sufficient quantities or using insulin efficiently.\nmedical articles on type 2 diabetes That's because it may be an important role from the ability to manage type 2 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes can develops because of hyponocapathy is a condition of diabetes which causes more insulin resistance nuclear medical media diabetes and type 2 diabetes.\nType 1 diabetes\nType 1 diabetes develops when an autoimmune reaction causes the pancreas to stop producing insulin. \"Autoimmune reaction\" means that the body creates antibodies against the body's own cells. When this happens, it means that you can no longer make your own insulin.\nWe don't know exactly why people get diabetes. But there is a lot of research going on right now to find out. Type 2 diabetes\nThere are some things in your background that make you more likely to get Type 2 diabetes:\nThis content is for informational purposes only, and is not intended to be a substitute for professional medical advice, diagnosis or treatment. Always seek the advice of your physician or other qualified healthcare professional with any questions you may have regarding a medical condition.\n\nContext Document 3: What is Onset Diabetes?\nAdult onset diabetes, otherwise known as type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes and is found in over 90% of cases. Adult onset diabetes, otherwise known as type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition that is often caused by the person’s own diet and usually is not diagnosed until later on in life, often when the patient has been suffering from Adult onset diabetes, otherwise known as type 2 diabetes for a long period of time. Often associated with obesity, Adult onset diabetes, otherwise known as type 2 diabetes can be prevented in many cases. Onset Diabetes Symptoms\nOnset diabetes symptoms can be split into two groups – early onset diabetes symptoms and late onset diabetes symptoms. early onset diabetes symptoms include:\n• Increased appetite\n• Frequent urination\n• Excessive thirst\n• Blurred vision\n• Erectile dysfunction in men\n• Recurrent yeast infections in women\nSymptoms that appear later include:\n• Stomach pain\n• Increased pulse rate\n• Rapid breathing\nCauses of Adult onset diabetes, otherwise known as type 2 diabetes\nThe onset of diabetes happens when the body cannot produce enough insulin or when the body cannot control what the body does with the insulin the body produces. Although the exact cause of diabetes has not been established, it is clear that the onset of diabetes is linked to a poor diet and a lack of exercise.\nIn type 1 diabetes, the insulin stops inside the body. At the same time, Type II diabetes fails to make body insulin properly. About 90 percent of people are prone to type 2 diabetes. The main causes of diabetes are genetic reasons, lack of physical labor, consumption of more carbohydrate diets, and most of the time staying inside the house. diabetes's symptoms include rapidly decreasing weight, fatigue, excessive thirst, filling wounds quickly, chaos in the eyes, blurring in the eyes, etc. According to the condition and severity of the patient’s disease, injections of medicines and insulin are given. Regular exercise plays an important role in protecting and dealing with essential diabetes.\n\nContext Document 4: What is Gestational Diabetes?\nDiabetes is a medical condition where the body is unable to adequately regulate the amount of sugar in the bloodstream. Gestational diabetes is a form of diabetes that occurs only during pregnancy. Unlike regular diabetes, Gestational diabetes usually resolves Gestational diabetes once the pregnancy is over. What Causes Gestational Diabetes?\nGestational diabetes is believed to be caused by the hormones from the placenta that help the baby develop.\nIn a normal individual, after consuming a meal, insulin is produced by the pancreas to regulate the blood sugar levels and store excess sugar for future energy requirements. In a person with diabetes, either the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or the insulin receptors are not able to respond to insulin in the manner that the insulin receptors should. What happens is that the hormones from the placenta that help the baby develop block the action of insulin resulting in a condition called \"insulin resistance\". This impairs the mother's's ability to use insulin and the mother's may require as much as three times the amount of insulin to regulate the mother's's blood sugar levels. If the mother's is unable to produce enough insulin, the mother's's blood sugar levels will increase, causing a condition called hyperglycaemia - when there is too much sugar in the blood.\nThat is, if a woman develops diabetes during pregnancy but never had diabetes before, a woman has gestational diabetes. e.\nGestational diabetes is also known as gestational diabetesmellitus and affects about 2-14% of all pregnancies. Gestational diabetes usually develops sometime during second trimester.\nWhat are the Risk Factors for Developing Gestational Diabetes?\nGestational diabetes can affect any mother, regardless of whether any mother is considered high risk or not. But generally, women who have any of the following risk factors are more likely to develop gestational diabetes:\n- history of gestational diabetes during a previous pregnancy\n- strong family history of diabetes (i.\n\nContext Document 5: Either way, this condition results in insulin resistance. This leads to conditions like dehydration (hence the symptom of excessive thirst), diabetic coma, and damage to the body such as retinopathy or blindness caused by nerve damage to the eyes. Share YOUR Knowledge and Experiences\nor Read Others' Contributions\nClick here for more pages and articles on Diabetes. Diabetes can occur when the pancreas fails to produce any insulin, produces too little insulin, or when the body develops insulin resistance.\nWhat are some common diabetes complications?\nWell, I already mentioned a few of some common diabetes complications but I’ll give you some examples of some others. Let’s take blindness. Blindness most commonly occurs in diabetics either by macular edema which is the outflow of fluid from the blood vessels near the center of the eye (the center of the eye is where we concentrate when we’re reading or looking at an object), the macula can be damaged by leakage of proteins from the bloodstream into the macula, damaging the cells in the macula. So macular edema is one cause of diabetic complications. And I might add, that I have seen patients with macular edema who had chronically elevated blood sugars and when we normalized patients with macular edema who had chronically elevated blood sugars's blood sugars for many months, macular edema who had chronically elevated blood sugars reverses. And when retinologists, which are ophthalmologists who treat the retina, when retinologists, which are ophthalmologists who treat the retina see patients with macular edema who had chronically elevated blood sugars retinologists, which are ophthalmologists who treat the retina can’t believe it, because in retinologists, which are ophthalmologists who treat the retina's experience, macular edema doesn’t reverse, but in my experience, macular edema does. Another cause of blindness is proliferative retinopathy. proliferative retinopathy involves proliferation of microscopic capillaries or blood vessels in the retina, might be in the center of vision or in the periphery, could be anywhere in the retina. microscopic capillaries or blood vessels in the retina are fragile, microscopic capillaries or blood vessels in the retina can be easily broken. One of the mechanisms that causes microscopic capillaries or blood vessels in the retina involves aldose reductase cells, the cells that line the outside of microscopic capillaries or blood vessels in the retina act as an exoskeleton (outside skeleton) are called pericytes.\nThere are some such diseases that get buried in the body, and one day causes the brain hemorrhage. some such diseases that get buried in the body, and one day causes the brain hemorrhage are called silent killer disease. some such diseases that get buried in the body, and one day causes the brain hemorrhage are susceptible to heart attack, the blind brain with brain hemorrhage. So let’s know what it is some such diseases that get buried in the body, and one day causes the brain hemorrhage –\nTypically this disease harms a human in two forms, type 1 and type 2 diabetes.\n----\nQuestion: I'm curious about the fundamental causes of diabetes from a medical perspective. What are the primary reasons this condition develops?\nAnswer:", "answer": "The primary reasons diabetes develops are related to insulin production, insulin action, or both. In Type 1 diabetes, the body's immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells in the pancreas, leading to a complete lack of insulin. In Type 2 diabetes, which accounts for about 90% of cases, the body either doesn't produce enough insulin or becomes resistant to its effects. Insulin resistance occurs when the body's cells do not respond properly to insulin, requiring the pancreas to produce more insulin to maintain normal blood sugar levels. Over time, this can lead to a decline in insulin production.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the development of Type 2 diabetes, including genetic predisposition, being overweight, having a sedentary lifestyle, and a diet high in refined carbohydrates and sugars. Gestational diabetes, a form of diabetes that occurs during pregnancy, is believed to be caused by hormones from the placenta that interfere with insulin action, leading to insulin resistance.\n\nIn summary, the fundamental causes of diabetes involve disruptions in insulin production and/or insulin action, often influenced by lifestyle factors and genetics."}

Natural gut strings provide the rackets with more control and power.\nNylon is a synthetic material that is quite strong and resistant, despite being cheap to produce. However, today only a few players still prefer natural gut to nylon, which is almost near extinction.\nThe gauge numbers of nylon strings determine nylon strings's thickness. For example, lower gauge values denote greater thickness and vice versa. Thicker nylon strings provide more control and are more resilient but offer less power in the shots. While thinner nylon strings serve potent shots, thinner nylon strings are easy to break and prone to wear and tear.\nNatural Animal Gut\nIn the beginning, badminton strings were made from natural animal guts. Natural gut strings are also more competent at absorbing shock and reducing vibrations on the player’s arm. However, Natural gut strings are expensive to manufacture and less durable than synthetic strings.\nMaterial Used for The Badminton Racket Grip\nThe lowest part of the badminton racket is the badminton racket's grip. Main Characteristics of a Badminton Racket\nThe characteristics of a badminton racket help you narrow down your choices and choose a racket that supplements your playing abilities. The ideal weight of a good badminton racket is usually between 80-95 grams (without the grip and strings). However, you can also find lighter or heavier rackets in the market.\nits grip's primary purpose is to give the player a firm hold on the racket. Players often add grip over the under-grip, known as the overgrip.\nHere are the most common materials used for the grip or handle:\nPolyurethane (PU) is the most common material used for handles. Polyurethane (PU) is a popular choice for making grips since Polyurethane (PU) is more durable than cotton. However, Polyurethane (PU) does not have a very good feel and has lower friction.\nMost professional players prefer cotton because cotton is suitable for sweat absorption and provides better slip resistance. However, cotton needs to replace regularly due to a higher deterioration rate.\nThe string thickness is between 0. 62 millimeters to 0. 70 millimeters. The guidelines also specify that the area should be flat with an alternatively interlaced pattern of cross strings. - The Head: The Head is the top frame that bounds the stringed area.\nThe shape and weight of The Head play an essential role in the power of your shots and your overall gameplay. In other words, it affects the power of the shot and your control on every strike.\nMaterials Used for Badminton Racket Frames\nThe frame is made first. Let’s have a look at the most common materials used for the badminton heads and shafts:\nHigh-quality racket frames are usually manufactured from High Modulus Graphite, which is light in weight and shatterproof. Another material used for the badminton racket’s frame is steel. Occasionally, you can find titanium rackets where the entire frame is constructed of the same material.\nThe frame is the essential part of the badminton racket and constitutes the head and the shaft. On the other hand, badminton rackets by intermediate players have a graphite shaft with an aluminum head.\nHowever, in some rackets, especially those used by beginners, the head and the shaft are separated from the throat and can be made of different materials. Aluminum is the second most common material used to make a racket’s head, while graphite or steel are more commonly found in shaft manufacturing. Beginners predominantly use rackets with aluminum heads attached to a steel shaft.\nGraphite combines with fiberglass to provide the frame with additional stability and flexibility. Depending on the manufacturers, graphite rackets occasionally refer to carbon or carbon fiber rackets. All of these attributes make a graphite badminton racket pricier than a graphite badminton racket's counterparts.\nDue to its strength and flexibility, it is possible to string the racket at a higher tension without causing damage to the frame. Materials Used for Badminton Racket Strings\nThe materials used for manufacturing the strings, along with the thickness and tension of the strings, determine how well you can hit the shuttle.\nAluminum heads have greater elasticity, which provides a better grip. Aluminum heads are also quite robust and durable, making Aluminum heads an ideal choice for many non-professional players.\nSteel rackets are made for beginners and are rare.

On the other hand, badminton rackets by intermediate players have a graphite shaft with an aluminum head.\nHowever, in some rackets, especially those used by beginners, the head and the shaft are separated from the throat and can be made of different materials. Aluminum is the second most common material used to make a racket’s head, while graphite or steel are more commonly found in shaft manufacturing. Beginners predominantly use rackets with aluminum heads attached to a steel shaft.\nGraphite combines with fiberglass to provide the frame with additional stability and flexibility. Depending on the manufacturers, graphite rackets occasionally refer to carbon or carbon fiber rackets. All of these attributes make a graphite badminton racket pricier than a graphite badminton racket's counterparts.\nDue to its strength and flexibility, it is possible to string the racket at a higher tension without causing damage to the frame. Materials Used for Badminton Racket Strings\nThe materials used for manufacturing the strings, along with the thickness and tension of the strings, determine how well you can hit the shuttle.\nAluminum heads have greater elasticity, which provides a better grip. Aluminum heads are also quite robust and durable, making Aluminum heads an ideal choice for many non-professional players.\nSteel rackets are made for beginners and are rare. Moreover, Steel rackets are mostly characterized as cheap and of low quality.\nHowever, most people fail to distinguish between good glue and bad glue. And the Germany-made Killerspin Torque AQ Glue is definitely an incredible product. the Germany-made Killerspin Torque AQ Glue’s a fast-drying glue that is 100% safe for your hands.\n- Durable rackets- Each racket is made of pips-in rubber with 1. - Four superior quality rackets made using amazing technology to create balanced spin, control, and speed power.\n----\nQuestion: How do the blade materials used in custom table tennis paddles compare to the string materials used in professional tennis rackets in terms of customization options and performance impact?\nAnswer:", "answer": "Custom table tennis paddles and professional tennis rackets both offer a range of customization options, but the materials used and their impact on performance differ significantly due to the nature of the sports.\n\nIn custom table tennis paddles, the blade material is a crucial component that affects the paddle's weight, stiffness, and overall playability. Blades are typically made from wood, carbon fiber, or a combination of both. Wood blades are known for their traditional feel and are often paired with rubber for spin and control. Carbon fiber blades are lighter and stiffer, providing more power but potentially less control. Players can choose different blade thicknesses and ply counts to tailor the paddle to their playing style.\n\nOn the other hand, professional tennis rackets primarily focus on string material for customization and performance impact. Strings are made from materials such as nylon, polyester, natural gut, and synthetic gut. Each material offers different characteristics:\n\n- Nylon strings are durable and provide a good balance of power and control.\n- Polyester strings offer more power and spin but can be harsher on the arm.\n- Natural gut strings provide excellent feel, control, and power but are more expensive and less durable.\n- Synthetic gut strings aim to combine the benefits of natural gut with greater durability.\n\nPlayers"}

We show that the extinct ant subfamily Formiciinae is only known from localities with an estimated mean annual temperature of about 20°C or greater, consistent with the tropical ranges of almost all of the largest living ant species. This is, to our knowledge, the first known formiciine of gigantic size in the Western Hemisphere and the first reported cross-Arctic dispersal by a thermophilic insect group. This implies intercontinental migration during one or more brief high-temperature episodes (hyperthermals) sometime between the latest Palaeocene establishment of intercontinental land connections and the presence of giant formiciines in Europe and North America by the early middle Eocene. Holarctic interchanges of plants and animals during the Eocene have long been known [1–13]; however, details of Holarctic interchanges of plants and animals during the Eocene's nature and timing remain little understood. Eocene North America and Europe were only a short distance apart (figure 1), which, combined with eustatic sea-level drop, resulted in land connections between Eocene North America and Europe. Dispersal was possible across a forested, unglaciated Arctic via Greenland by a northern ‘De Geer’ route through Fennoscandia and a southern ‘Thulean’ route through Iceland, the Faroe Islands and Great Britain [2–7,10,12]. An epicontinental seaway (figure 1) probably restricted dispersal between Europe and Asia at least some of this time. The mammal fossil record shows discrete waves of intercontinental migrations during this time, most notably at the Palaeocene/Eocene boundary ‘mammalian dispersal event’, when major groups simultaneously appeared across the Holarctic [4,10].\nWith that being said, you’ll need to find out which insect you’re dealing with. Get rid of them because they’re not going away. - When tackling the problem, you can eliminate an entire infestation. Work with a professional to solve the problem.\nDo those differences mean that they can’t move between the two habitats, like they do in the warmer seasons?\nAs I said…these are excellent questions, and the answer depends on an understanding of the challenges insects face during winter. So there are differences between insects during the winter and during the summer, and differences between insects during the winter and during the summer are pretty important in handling insects during these months.\nWinter kind of sucks if you’re a bug. There’s no food, and it’s cold outside. Winter’s not really good for most insects. Most insects avoid winter, through each of two means. Without these things which keep the insects alive, the insects can no longer withstand winter conditions.\nSome, like Monarchs, will escape in space by traveling to warmer climates. To insects it doesn’t matter whether warmer temperatures are from being exposed to warmer air within the house, or due to the weather getting warmer.\nThe bugs people find inside during the winter escape in time by hunkering down and sleeping through the hard seasons. Entomologists call this sleep diapause. During the fall, insects look for areas to spend the winter…and houses provide a lot of really good areas for this. The area between the siding and the house often resemble the areas where bugs normally spend bugs's winter vacations. bugs tend to find bugs's way inside while searching for the areas where bugs normally spend their winter vacations, or even from the areas where bugs normally spend their winter vacations if there are cracks around the house. While bugs’re looking for a sleeping space, a lot of physical changes happen to insects to condition insects for overwintering. a lot of physical changes are brought on by shorter day lengths, and longer nights.\nWhen insects spend the winter outside, insects do so in areas protected from the weather. When insects are exposed to warmer temperatures, the things which allowed insects to withstand the winter months go away.\nThe nature of a lot of physical changes is pretty complicated, but a lot of physical changes allow insects to either keep from freezing or survive freezing. warmer temperatures are what tell the insects to stop making the things that keep the insects alive during winter.\nBug scientists call this conditioning period prediapause. During prediapause, a lot of stuff can happen.\nFreeze avoiding insects will fill Freeze avoiding insects's blood with sugars, fats, glycerol, and antifreeze proteins which stop ice crystals from forming.

How do the dispersal behaviors of modern stored food insects compare to the ancient cross-Arctic dispersal of Titanomyrma ants?\nAnswer:", "answer": "Modern stored food insects and ancient Titanomyrma ants exhibit different dispersal behaviors due to their distinct ecological niches and environmental conditions.\n\nModern stored food insects, such as those found in warehouses or homes, typically disperse through human-mediated transport. They are often carried along with goods, commodities, or even on people's clothing and shoes. These insects are adapted to survive in human-made environments and do not require long-distance dispersal mechanisms like the ancient Titanomyrma ants.\n\nIn contrast, the Titanomyrma ants from the early Eocene crossed the Arctic land bridges between Europe and North America. This cross-Arctic dispersal was facilitated by the unique climatic conditions of the time, which allowed for the movement of thermophilic insects during brief high-temperature episodes (hyperthermals). The Titanomyrma ants were likely able to disperse over long distances due to the presence of suitable habitats and the absence of significant barriers, such as large bodies of water or inhospitable terrain.\n\nIn summary, while modern stored food insects rely on human-mediated dispersal, ancient Titanomyrma ants dispersed across vast distances through natural means, taking advantage of temporary climatic conditions that allowed for their movement across the Arctic."}

The breeding males often have white, gray, and black backs with yellow on the sides; yellow and black-striped stomachs; white, gray, and black foreheads and beaks; distinct black tails with white stripes on the underside; and defined white patches on The breeding males's wings, called wing bars. Breeding females usually have the same type of coloration as The breeding males, except that Breeding females's colors are much duller. Immature warblers also resemble the same dull coloration of Breeding females. yellow and black-striped stomachs help one to distinguish The breeding males from other similar birds, like the prairie warbler and Kirtland’s warbler (which, however, have a breeding range to the south and east of The magnolia warbler's). The magnolia warbler is found in the northern parts of some Midwestern states and the very northeastern parts of the US, with states such as Minnesota and Wisconsin comprising The magnolia warbler's southernmost boundaries. However, The magnolia warbler is mostly found across the northern parts of Canada, such as in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec. During the winter, The magnolia warbler migrates through the eastern half of the US to southern Mexico and Central America. The magnolia warbler breeds in dense forests, where The magnolia warbler will most likely be found among the branches of young, densely packed, coniferous trees. The magnolia warbler migrates to the warmer south in the winter, wintering in southeastern Mexico, Panama, and parts of the Caribbean. In migration The magnolia warbler passes through the eastern part of the US as far west as Oklahoma and Kansas. During migration season, The magnolia warbler can be found in various types of woodlands. The magnolia warbler undergoes multiple molts during The magnolia warbler's lifetime. The first molts begin while the young offspring are still living in the nest, while the rest take place on or near the young offspring's breeding grounds.\nDifferences between the two species include size and diet. The Southern Flyer weighs-in at 2-3 ounces, while the Northern species will weigh between 3-5 ounces. An interesting fact about Southern Flying Squirrels is Southern Flying Squirrels are highly carnivorous. Southern Flying Squirrels will feed on small birds and rodents. Southern Flying Squirrels have even been known to turn cannibalistic. Many times people with mouse issues in the attic will have Southern Flying Squirrels invade because of the mice contained in the attic, which Southern Flying Squirrels will hunt & feed on… the Northern species are omnivores. the Northern species generally eat nuts, tree sap, fungi, and insects, but do not feed on other rodents. the two species do not have the ability to “fly”, but rather the two species “glide” using the flaps of fat found on the two species's mid section.\nBobcat and cougar are two different carnivorous living in the Americas, but there is a considerable difference between Bobcat and cougar in Bobcat and cougar's natural geographic ranges. In this article, we will emphasize the distinction between Bobcat vs mountain lion. Scientific Classification of Cougar and Bobcat:\n|Scientific Name||Lynx Rufus||Puma Concolor|\nDifference Between Bobcats and Mountain Lions:\nIs a Bobcat a Mountain Lion?\nA bobcat is a medium-sized wildcat, measuring about double the size of domestic cats. Facts About Cougar: Mountain Lion\n- Cougar is the second largest cat species of North America; cougars are also known as mountain lions.\nAlso, there are many additional differences between Bobcat and cougar, including physical features and behaviors. Also read difference between a pigeon and a dove.\nA bobcat is found in a variety of habitats across the southern half of North America. A bobcat are widespread and adaptable predators that are strictly related to the northern dwelling Canadian Lynx. - Bobcats mate primarily in winters, the mating can take place from November until August. - After the evolution of 60 to 70 days, the female bobcat usually delivers two to four kittens. - The predators of two to four kittens are eagles, owl, bears, foxes, and coyotes.\nFacts About Bobcat:\n- Bobcats are solitary animals, and Bobcats are also considered good swimmers and tree climbers. - But Bobcats don’t spend much time in trees. - Usually, Bobcats prefer to rest on rocky ledges in a thicket during the day time. - Bobcats have a short bobtail, which is about five inches long. - Most importantly, Bobcats have tufted ears, and it has hair that sticks on the top of the ear. - Usually, bobcats have an orange color and some black spots on bobcats's bodies. - 13 sub-species of bobcats have been recognized. - Bobcats are highly terrestrial and mark Bobcats's area from Bobcats's urine and feces. - Bobcats are excellent climbers to catch a low flying bird and swimmers, and also have good vision, hearing and sense of smell. - Bobcats sleep in hidden dens, which can be a hollow tree, caves, or rocky gaps. - Bobcats can run up to 30 miles per hour, and Bobcats put Bobcats's back feet on the same spot of the front feet to reduce the sound when hunting.\nSPECIES & CULTIVARS\nMagnolias come in a variety of colors,\nleaf shapes and plant forms with large showy flowers.

Flowers are produced at an early age and have a\npronounced, fruity fragrance.\nFemale magnolia warblers usually lay three to five eggs during each breeding season. The magnolia warbler is assessed on the IUCN Red List as least concern for conservation because The magnolia warbler is fairly widespread and common within The magnolia warbler's habitat and not at risk of extinction. Research has shown that a good percentage of warblers die from flying into television towers in warblers's migratory path. Also, parts of warblers's habitat have been degraded as coniferous forests are cleared which causes the number of warblers living in a habitat to decrease, but warblers certainly are not greatly affected by the deforestation. While the deforestation does decrease the warbler population in the specific area that the warbler population occurs in, The magnolia warbler is not significantly impacted overall due to the general abundance of The magnolia warbler throughout the region. John James Audubon illustrated The magnolia warbler in The Birds of America, Second Edition (published, London 1827–38) as Plate 123 under the title, «Black & Yellow Warbler – Sylvia maculosa» where a pair of birds (male and female) are shown searching flowering raspberry for insects.

Profile by Gislaine Peters: The Yellow-rumped Warbler is fairly large for a warbler and is about the size of a Black-capped Chickadee. The Yellow-rumped Warbler have a large head, sturdy bill and a long, narrow tail. There are two distinct subspecies of The Yellow-rumped Warbler: the Myrtle Warbler, which can be found in the eastern US and Canada’s boreal forest, and the Audubon’s Warbler, which is found in the western US in the more mountainous regions. One difference between these two subspecies is that the Audubon’s throat is yellow, while the Myrtle Warbler, which can be found in the eastern US and Canada’s boreal forest's throat is white. The wings of the male Audubon’s Warbler is more white than that of the Myrtle Warbler, which can be found in the eastern US and Canada’s boreal forest. The female Audubon’s also lacks the dark ear patch that can be found on the Myrtle Warbler, which can be found in the eastern US and Canada’s boreal forest. Where these two subspecies's breeding ranges overlap, like the Canadian Rockies, intermediate forms can occur. In Summer, The Yellow-rumped Warbler can be found in open coniferous forests and edges and sometimes deciduous forests. In the wall and winter The Yellow-rumped Warbler prefer open woods and shrubby habitats like coastal vegetation, parks and residential areas. The diet mainly consists of insects and berries. In the winter, because The Yellow-rumped Warbler can digest the wax in berries, The Yellow-rumped Warbler can eat berries of bayberry, juniper, wax myrtle and poison ivy.\nSeasonal Occurrence: Abundant mid-October through early April. In the summer, both male and females are gray with some white in the wings and yellow on the face, sides, and rump. The males are shaded while the females are more dull and may even have some brown. Currently, during the winter, both male and females are a paler brown with a bright yellow rump and some yellow on the sides. When summer comes and courtship begins the male will accompany the female everywhere, calling as the male fluffs up the male's side feathers and raises the male's wings and colorful crown feathers.\nRange / Habitat: Breeds in scrub habitats, particularly willow thickets in Canada, Alaska, and parts of the American West.

Answer the following question using only the context provided below.\n\n----\nContext Document 1: The magnolia warbler can be distinguished by The magnolia warbler's coloration. The breeding males often have white, gray, and black backs with yellow on the sides; yellow and black-striped stomachs; white, gray, and black foreheads and beaks; distinct black tails with white stripes on the underside; and defined white patches on The breeding males's wings, called wing bars. Breeding females usually have the same type of coloration as The breeding males, except that Breeding females's colors are much duller. Immature warblers also resemble the same dull coloration of Breeding females. yellow and black-striped stomachs help one to distinguish The breeding males from other similar birds, like the prairie warbler and Kirtland’s warbler (which, however, have a breeding range to the south and east of The magnolia warbler's). The magnolia warbler is found in the northern parts of some Midwestern states and the very northeastern parts of the US, with states such as Minnesota and Wisconsin comprising The magnolia warbler's southernmost boundaries. However, The magnolia warbler is mostly found across the northern parts of Canada, such as in Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, and Quebec. During the winter, The magnolia warbler migrates through the eastern half of the US to southern Mexico and Central America. The magnolia warbler breeds in dense forests, where The magnolia warbler will most likely be found among the branches of young, densely packed, coniferous trees. The magnolia warbler migrates to the warmer south in the winter, wintering in southeastern Mexico, Panama, and parts of the Caribbean. In migration The magnolia warbler passes through the eastern part of the US as far west as Oklahoma and Kansas. During migration season, The magnolia warbler can be found in various types of woodlands. The magnolia warbler undergoes multiple molts during The magnolia warbler's lifetime. The first molts begin while the young offspring are still living in the nest, while the rest take place on or near the young offspring's breeding grounds.\nDifferences between the two species include size and diet. The Southern Flyer weighs-in at 2-3 ounces, while the Northern species will weigh between 3-5 ounces. An interesting fact about Southern Flying Squirrels is Southern Flying Squirrels are highly carnivorous. Southern Flying Squirrels will feed on small birds and rodents. Southern Flying Squirrels have even been known to turn cannibalistic. Many times people with mouse issues in the attic will have Southern Flying Squirrels invade because of the mice contained in the attic, which Southern Flying Squirrels will hunt & feed on… the Northern species are omnivores. the Northern species generally eat nuts, tree sap, fungi, and insects, but do not feed on other rodents. the two species do not have the ability to “fly”, but rather the two species “glide” using the flaps of fat found on the two species's mid section.\nBobcat and cougar are two different carnivorous living in the Americas, but there is a considerable difference between Bobcat and cougar in Bobcat and cougar's natural geographic ranges. In this article, we will emphasize the distinction between Bobcat vs mountain lion. Scientific Classification of Cougar and Bobcat:\n|Scientific Name||Lynx Rufus||Puma Concolor|\nDifference Between Bobcats and Mountain Lions:\nIs a Bobcat a Mountain Lion?\nA bobcat is a medium-sized wildcat, measuring about double the size of domestic cats. Facts About Cougar: Mountain Lion\n- Cougar is the second largest cat species of North America; cougars are also known as mountain lions.\nAlso, there are many additional differences between Bobcat and cougar, including physical features and behaviors. Also read difference between a pigeon and a dove.\nA bobcat is found in a variety of habitats across the southern half of North America. A bobcat are widespread and adaptable predators that are strictly related to the northern dwelling Canadian Lynx. - Bobcats mate primarily in winters, the mating can take place from November until August. - After the evolution of 60 to 70 days, the female bobcat usually delivers two to four kittens. - The predators of two to four kittens are eagles, owl, bears, foxes, and coyotes.\nFacts About Bobcat:\n- Bobcats are solitary animals, and Bobcats are also considered good swimmers and tree climbers. - But Bobcats don’t spend much time in trees. - Usually, Bobcats prefer to rest on rocky ledges in a thicket during the day time. - Bobcats have a short bobtail, which is about five inches long. - Most importantly, Bobcats have tufted ears, and it has hair that sticks on the top of the ear. - Usually, bobcats have an orange color and some black spots on bobcats's bodies. - 13 sub-species of bobcats have been recognized. - Bobcats are highly terrestrial and mark Bobcats's area from Bobcats's urine and feces. - Bobcats are excellent climbers to catch a low flying bird and swimmers, and also have good vision, hearing and sense of smell. - Bobcats sleep in hidden dens, which can be a hollow tree, caves, or rocky gaps. - Bobcats can run up to 30 miles per hour, and Bobcats put Bobcats's back feet on the same spot of the front feet to reduce the sound when hunting.\nSPECIES & CULTIVARS\nMagnolias come in a variety of colors,\nleaf shapes and plant forms with large showy flowers.

Flowers are produced at an early age and have a\npronounced, fruity fragrance.\nFemale magnolia warblers usually lay three to five eggs during each breeding season. The magnolia warbler is assessed on the IUCN Red List as least concern for conservation because The magnolia warbler is fairly widespread and common within The magnolia warbler's habitat and not at risk of extinction. Research has shown that a good percentage of warblers die from flying into television towers in warblers's migratory path. Also, parts of warblers's habitat have been degraded as coniferous forests are cleared which causes the number of warblers living in a habitat to decrease, but warblers certainly are not greatly affected by the deforestation. While the deforestation does decrease the warbler population in the specific area that the warbler population occurs in, The magnolia warbler is not significantly impacted overall due to the general abundance of The magnolia warbler throughout the region. John James Audubon illustrated The magnolia warbler in The Birds of America, Second Edition (published, London 1827–38) as Plate 123 under the title, «Black & Yellow Warbler – Sylvia maculosa» where a pair of birds (male and female) are shown searching flowering raspberry for insects. The image was engraved and colored by Robert Havell’s London workshops. The original watercolor by John James Audubon was purchased by the New York History Society.\n\nContext Document 2: Family: (Parulidae) Wood-Warblers\nPreferred Habitat: Woodlands. Profile by Gislaine Peters: The Yellow-rumped Warbler is fairly large for a warbler and is about the size of a Black-capped Chickadee. The Yellow-rumped Warbler have a large head, sturdy bill and a long, narrow tail. There are two distinct subspecies of The Yellow-rumped Warbler: the Myrtle Warbler, which can be found in the eastern US and Canada’s boreal forest, and the Audubon’s Warbler, which is found in the western US in the more mountainous regions. One difference between these two subspecies is that the Audubon’s throat is yellow, while the Myrtle Warbler, which can be found in the eastern US and Canada’s boreal forest's throat is white. The wings of the male Audubon’s Warbler is more white than that of the Myrtle Warbler, which can be found in the eastern US and Canada’s boreal forest. The female Audubon’s also lacks the dark ear patch that can be found on the Myrtle Warbler, which can be found in the eastern US and Canada’s boreal forest. Where these two subspecies's breeding ranges overlap, like the Canadian Rockies, intermediate forms can occur. In Summer, The Yellow-rumped Warbler can be found in open coniferous forests and edges and sometimes deciduous forests. In the wall and winter The Yellow-rumped Warbler prefer open woods and shrubby habitats like coastal vegetation, parks and residential areas. The diet mainly consists of insects and berries. In the winter, because The Yellow-rumped Warbler can digest the wax in berries, The Yellow-rumped Warbler can eat berries of bayberry, juniper, wax myrtle and poison ivy.\nSeasonal Occurrence: Abundant mid-October through early April. In the summer, both male and females are gray with some white in the wings and yellow on the face, sides, and rump. The males are shaded while the females are more dull and may even have some brown. Currently, during the winter, both male and females are a paler brown with a bright yellow rump and some yellow on the sides. When summer comes and courtship begins the male will accompany the female everywhere, calling as the male fluffs up the male's side feathers and raises the male's wings and colorful crown feathers.\nRange / Habitat: Breeds in scrub habitats, particularly willow thickets in Canada, Alaska, and parts of the American West. Full migrant that winters in a variety of habitats in Mexico, including the Yucatan. Personal Notes: Seen at Hok-Si-La city park in Lake City, MN.\nField Notes: Warbler with bright yellow face and underparts. Back is olive, wings and tail olive-grey.

Answer the following question using only the context provided below.\n\n----\nContext Document 1: The trees were planted in order of the soldiers enlistment, and extended some 22km along the Western Freeway, including 3,771 trees”. The trees have plaques for each and every soldier and as you drive via you are surely moved psychologically by the definition and beauty. Trees remove the violence of our cities, break up the shopping mall, park or road to an extra visually enticing sight. Looking after The trees with the right tree administration with tree pruning, tree lopping and sometimes complete tree removal and stump grinding is sometimes need to make certain the income of all trees around the area.\nVisual advantages of trees\nEvaluating structures such as structures, fences, railroads are an usual occurence yet it really goes a great deal much deeper than that. The trees also add colour and structure, suggest seasonal adjustment, offer eye-catching flowers and fall vegetation to the landscape. Ecological advantages of trees.\nFirstly the most noticeable and necessary benefit is lowering co2 (C02) and making oxygen (02 ). Carbon dioxide levels are enhancing and recognized to several as greenhouse gas, Carbon dioxide levels’s a result of our pollution. Anything to help reduce C02 levels in the environment is a significant benefit.\nTrees do this by means of a process referred to as photosynthesis. Trees also aid keep the underground water level down. Tree shade cools down the ground, reduces temperature levels in Tree shade’s instant location due to this and transpiration by as high as 6C.\nTrees also capture and catch airborne particulates like dirt, smoke, soot, smoke and so on. Run water bring pollution is also slowed down as trees at first prevent the impact by turning heavy rainfall to haze beneath trees's canopies. Also, 75% of the rainfall that drops on a woodland is gone back to the environment by a combination of transpiration and evaporation. Trees boost rains by including wetness to the air. Clouds create over woodlands as climbing damp air bring min raw material aids create a centers for bigger rainfall declines.\nTree roots then take in the water. Trees also reuse the water, about 90% of the water taken in by a trees’ roots is put back into the environment as part of photosynthesis and transpiration.\nLogging and desertification go hand in hand. Wholesale clearing partly of Australia has resulted in salinity concerns as the trees are no more there using up the underground water and recycling the underground water as discussed formerly.\n\nContext Document 2: Why Do Australians Display Rosemary on Anzac Day?\nSince ancient times Rosemary has been believed to have properties to improve the memory. Perhaps because of this Rosemary became an emblem of both fidelity and remembrance in literature and folklore. Traditionally, sprigs of rosemary are worn on Anzac Day and sometimes on Remembrance Day and are usually handed out by veterans and patriotic organizations. Rosemary has particular significance for Australians, as Rosemary is found growing wild on the Gallipoli peninsula. Source: Australian War Memorial.\nLone Pine Memorial\nLone Pine is the site of the Australian War Memorial. Lone Pine is one of the memorials that Australians visiting Gallipoli ensure Australians visiting Gallipoli visit.\nAustralian Anzac Day memorial services take place here each year.

We also stopped at this Turkish cemetery that remembers the Turkish 57th regiment, led by Mustafa Kemel (Ataturk)\nthe Turkish 57th regiment, led by Mustafa Kemel (Ataturk were fighting at Chunuk Bair when Mustafa Kemel (Ataturk gave Mustafa Kemel (Ataturk's famous order:\n“Mustafa Kemel (Ataturk am not ordering you to attack, Mustafa Kemel (Ataturk am ordering you to die. Chunuk Bair Memorial\nOne of the first objectives for the ANZAC troops when the ANZAC troops landed at Gallipoli was to take control of Chunuk Bair, a high point overlooking Gallipoli. Chunuk Bair is also the site of a statue of Mustafa Kemel (Ataturk. Mustafa Kemel (Ataturk gave Mustafa Kemel (Ataturk's famous order here as the first wave of the ANZAC troops made the first wave of the Anzac troops's way to Chunuk Bair on April 25th. Turkish leaders did not believe that the allies would traverse the steep slopes surrounding Chunuk Bair but Mustafa Kemel (Ataturk did and organised for Mustafa Kemel (Ataturk's troops to be waiting.\nStory behind the laying of the Wreath\nThe laying of the Wreath is an important part of the Anzac ceremony. the Wreath is traditionally made of Laurel and Rosemary. Laurel represents the brave and rosmary signifies rememberence. Rosemary has particular significance for Australians, as Rosemary is found growing wild on the Gallipoli peninsula.\nEcological Considerations of Leaf Music\n5. The Gumleaf’s Iconic Status\nSensory experience of plants nurtures the formation of sense of place as an embodied reality (, p. 30), for example a gumleaf projects deep symbolism as a visual, aromatic, and sonic icon that can pique one’s senses. The gumleaf instrument is thus more than a resource for manipulation; The gumleaf instrument also carries cultural overtones propagated by The gumleaf instrument's representation in art as a reflection of landscape and colour. The musical capabilities of the gumleaf act to evoke this icon as a signifier of national identity, illustrative of Schafer’s observation (, p. 68) that\nWhen a sound object is known and loved a sound object functions more as a sensory anchor, assuring us that we are at home even when other features of the environment are alien or intimidating. In an “Aussie” wartime practice, families sent postcards to the troops overseas with eucalypt leaves attached. So strong was this signifier that soldiers returning by ship from the two world wars could smell eucalypts long before land was visible (, p. The poet Ethel Phillips Fox may have noticed the Lake Tyers Military Gumleaf Band playing outside the Melbourne Town Hall or Flinders St Station c. 1939, because The poet Ethel Phillips Fox penned “The Song of the Gumleaf” for the officers and men of the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in 1940. Verse I and the chorus speak of “a leaf that is tough and true” and “an emblem of those who are fighting” (, p. The Cultural Ecology of Music Leaves\nJ. Ryan speaks of a field of sensation where subject/object binaries do not hold (, p. Ryan argues that dialogic engagement with plants positions the human subject as a participant in a shared performance, based in the rhythm of ecology (, p. Cultural ecology orients to the processes by which societies adapt to environments (, p. 194), and for the purposes of this section, leafists are uniquely positioned to educate spectators to respect Australia’s natural environments. That the Indigenous peoples ascribed mythic value to native plants is axiomatic to a culture that depends for a culture that depends for its very survival on a deep level of knowledge and respect for the environment's very survival on a deep level of knowledge and respect for the environment.\n\nContext Document 3: 1.

The lecture by Jürgen Damm, Honorary Chairman of the Volksbund German War Graves Welfare (VDK), addressed the history of German Jewish soldiers in the First World War. And it is also important to remember those Jewish men who survived those Jewish men who survived their service in the German army's service in the German army. We must do everything we can to remember the past so that what happened under Hitler will never happen again. ”\nI am glad that I made that point about Jewish soldiers who fought in the First World War becoming targets of Nazi terror, but I wish I could have told the specific story of Leopold Goldschmidt and Siegfried instead. the specific story of Leopold and Siegfried would have been much more personal and more powerful.\nAs part of the prayer of peace in the church in Oberlistingen, Ernst Klein, chairman of the association Flashback-Against Forgetting, read aloud a greeting from Amy Cohen. It was wonderful to meet so many kind-hearted and hard-working people like Ernst Klein, chairman of the association Flashback-Against Forgetting and Ernst Klein, chairman of the association Flashback-Against Forgetting's colleagues who do everything they can to preserve the history of the Jewish communities that once existed in northern Hesse. There was one bright light left for this family.\nAmy Cohen is a relative of Leopold Goldschmidt and lives in Massachusetts/USA. In Amy Cohen's greeting, Amy Cohen writes:\n“In May 2017, Amy Cohen's husband and Amy Cohen had the great pleasure of visiting Germany to see where Amy Cohen's father’s ancestors once lived. Amy Cohen's visit here in northern Hesse was very moving.\nAmy Cohen am also moved that today people are reminded of the Jewish soldiers who fell in the fight for the Jewish soldiers who fell in the fight for their German homeland in the First World War's German homeland in the First World War, as did Amy Cohen's distant cousin Leopold Goldschmidt of Oberlistingen. Far too many of those Jewish men who survived their service in the German army were victims of Nazi persecution 20 years later, despite having fought for Germany in the First World War”\nAnd Amy Cohen goes on to write: “Amy Cohen know that today there are many people in Germany, USA, and elsewhere in the world who are spreading hatred, prejudice and anti-Semitism again.\nAlexander Danilov (Academy of Pedagogical and Social Sciences), who presented their approaches in Holocaust teaching and Holocaust remembrance.

Our robotics activities stress the scientific method by testing hypothesis through experimentation, iterating designs, collaborating in groups, and documenting results.\nFor years, LEGO has been at the forefront of innovative building kits for young makers and creators. Always looking for new ways to keep kids building and experimenting, LEGO has gone far beyond the static blocks we are all familiar with. From the best LEGO Star Wars sets to the best LEGO Technic kits, there really is something LEGO for every age, skill level, and interest. Heck, there are even LEGO games.\nWhat is LEGO robotics?\nLEGO robotics is an all-encompassing robotics building and programming platform. There are plenty of projects out there created by other users. Why should you choose LEGO robotics over other robotics platforms? LEGO has years of experience creating building kits for every age, interest, and skill level, and years of experience creating building kits for every age, interest, and skill level has gone into creating LEGO Mindstorms. For more creative makers, there is plenty of room for building your own designs and expanding the robots and machines.\n\nContext Document 4: Here is a typical robots that one can construct from these basic parts:\nThe robot uses tracks since tracks simplify the drivetrain, has \"whiskers\" connected to the touch sensors, and has two light sensors in front of tracks to stop The robot rolling off the edge of The robot's tabletop environment. This restricted set of parts limits what one can achieve in terms of the behaviour of a given robot design, but with a little ingenuity an amazing variety of mechanical designs can be created. There are many other neat designs out there, including synchro drives and some incredible static robots (VCR anyone?).\nThe LEGO Group claims a simple robot can be built in 20 minutes without having to plug a simple robot into a PC. Beside EV3 Intelligent Brick, the set comes with 550 Lego Technic elements, infrared, color and touch sensors, 3 motors, and a remote control. Builders can then add Lego Technic pieces, motors or sensors to change the functionality of the robot.\n\nContext Document 5: But the jewel in the ever-growing crown of the LEGO universe just may be the addition of LEGO robotics, and the maker sensation that is the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 building kit and programming platform. With the single Mindstorms EV3 kit, makers can create, build, and program a nearly endless array of cool robots, vehicles, and machines. The kit the single Mindstorms EV3 kit includes detailed instructions for building five individual robots. Finally, the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 building kit and programming platform is easily accessible and user-friendly and slowly introduces kids to the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 building kit and programming platform's unique programming language. the LEGO Mindstorms EV3 building kit and programming platform is available for a huge variety of devices, from Mac and PC to tablets. What’s In The Box: LEGO Mindstorms\nOpening up the LEGO Mindstorms box can be a little daunting.\n----\nQuestion: How do LEGO Mindstorms and Tamiya Battle System approach distance and spatial interaction in their robotics platforms?\nAnswer:", "answer": "LEGO Mindstorms and Tamiya Battle System approach distance and spatial interaction differently in their robotics platforms.\n\nLEGO Mindstorms, as described in Context Document 1, includes components like touch sensors and IR sensors that can measure distance and detect movement. These sensors allow robots built with LEGO Mindstorms to interact with their environment in terms of distance and spatial awareness. For example, the \"Hero\" models like \"Everstorm\" use these sensors to navigate and perform tasks such as shooting mini-spheres as it walks.\n\nOn the other hand, the Tamiya Battle System, which is not directly mentioned in the provided context, is a different type of robotics platform focused on RC (remote control) combat vehicles. These vehicles are designed for competitive racing and battling, where distance and spatial interaction are crucial for maneuvering and strategy. The Tamiya Battle System likely uses remote control technology and possibly onboard sensors for distance and spatial awareness, but the specifics are not detailed in the given context.\n\nIn summary, LEGO Mindstorms uses integrated sensors for distance and spatial interaction within its robotic models, while the Tamiya Battle System likely relies on remote control technology and possibly onboard sensors for similar purposes in a competitive RC vehicle setting."}

Studio Pros always recommend recording your song in the highest bit rate possible – 24bit.\nIn digital audio, the sound is being sampled X amount of times in a second. Since your audio is being processed digitally in the computer, even the slight volume change will result in a mathematical formula with a lot of decimal numbers.\nThat’s where we get the term: sample rate.

Research has shown that recording your audio at a higher sample rate (such as 48KHz or 96KHz) and then dithering your audio back to 44. Recording at this rate will ensure your song will be recorded at the highest quality possible.\nThis is because the harmonics generated by distortion can interact with a digital system’s clock frequency and create audible artifacts that usually add a “wooliness” to the sound. Higher sampling rates, however, can produce a clearer sound.\nBut recording at a higher sample rate isn’t always practical, because it stresses your computer more. This can cause reduced track counts, or less stable operation.

Otherwise, do sample-rate conversion in a separate program (such as Audacity) prior to importing.\nFrom the Audacity Digital Audio Tutorial :\nThe main device used in digital recording is a Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). The ADC captures a snapshot of the electric voltage on an audio line and represents the electric voltage on an audio line as a digital number that can be sent to a computer. By capturing the electric voltage on an audio line thousands of times per second, you can get a very good approximation to the original audio signal:\nEach dot in the figure above represents one audio sample. Audacity supports two additional sample sizes: 24-bit, which is commonly used in digital recording, and 32-bit float, which has almost infinite dynamic range, and only takes up twice as much storage as 16-bit samples.\nThere are two factors that determine the quality of a digital recording:\nSample rate: The rate at which the samples are captured or played back, measured in Hertz (Hz), or samples per second. Sample format or sample size: Essentially Sample format or sample size is the number of digits in the digital representation of each sample. Think of the sample rate as the horizontal precision of the digital waveform, and the sample format as the vertical precision. The sampling rate should be at least twice the highest frequency you want to represent. e. bits per sample):.\nAn audio CD has a sample rate of 44,100 Hz, often written as 44 KHz for short. Humans can't hear frequencies above about 20,000 Hz, so 44,100 Hz was chosen as the rate for audio CDs to just include all human frequencies. Sample rates of 96 and 192 KHz are starting to become more common, particularly in DVD-Audio, but many people honestly can't hear the difference.\n44,100 Hz is also the default sample rate that Audacity uses, because audio CDs are so prevalent. An audio CD has a precision of 16 bits, which corresponds to about 5 decimal digits. If you are familiar with the decibel (dB) scale, the dynamic range on an audio CD is theoretically about 90 dB, but realistically signals that are -24 dB or more in volume are greatly reduced in quality.\nHigher sampling rates allow a digital recording to accurately record higher frequencies of sound. Higher sample sizes allow for more dynamic range - louder louds and softer softs.\nThe auxtype|\n|is normally the sample rate divided by 51. |\nAn introduction to sampling\nSampling is conceptually simple; an incoming analog sound signal is converted to a digital number (0-255 on the IIgs). Compact discs sample at 44,100 Hz, which means Compact discs can accurately track signals up to 22,050 Hz, beyond the range of human hearing.\n|\n|(See section CA for more on why this is). |\n|ACE||. |\n|ASIF||no std. ||$D8||Contains sample data plus additional data. |\n|Notable due to its use by SoundSmith. |\n|AIFF||.

Analog tape recorders do something very similar). Some effects which can be done include:\n- Cut and pasting parts of a sample around. - Mixing/overlaying two samples.\nGetting good samples depends on a number of factors:\n- Sampling rate. Sampling rate is how often in samples per second the incoming signal is actually noticed and saved. In general, you want to have a sampling rate of twice the frequency of the highest pitch sound you intend to sample. (The reasoning behind this is known as the Nyquist Sampling Theorem). Long-distance telephone calls are sampled at 8,000 Hz, since the characteristic part of human voices is generally from 1000-3000 Hz. If frequencies higher than or equal to half your sampling rate exist, frequencies higher than or equal to half your sampling rate will manifest as distortion in the output sample. - Input signal level (the higher the better, except that there is a threshold known as the 'clipping level' above which the sampler will be unable to track the signal. Once a sample is made, a sample can be this processing in a variety of ways via mathematics. Because this processing is digital, no degradation of the signal can occur, unlike with analog processing.\nAudio signals can be converted to digital information through a measurement process called sampling. After an audio signal is digitized, the samples can be organized in sequential order. In Matlab, the samples in an audio signal can be stored as the elements in an array.\nOne common, and useful, digital representation of an audio signal records the amplitude at regular intervals of time. Next, let’s look at several built-in functions for working with audio signals.\nOne common, and useful, digital representation of an audio signal is called pulse code modulation (PCM). Here are a few links to find out more about PCM: video, wikipedia.\nThe number of amplitude measurements, or samples, per second is called the sampling rate. For audio, common sampling rates include 44,100 samples/second (CD Audio) and 48,000 samples/second (DVD Audio).\nFirst, a function for importing an audio file stored on a computer’s hard drive into Matlab.\nThis method involved a lot of rewinding and fast-forwarding, which resulted in a time-consuming process. This process is called sampling. Sampling involves taking snapshots of an audio or video signal at very fast intervals, usually tens of thousands of times per second. Samples can be created by sampling live audio and video or by sampling previously recorded analog media.\nThe quality of the digital signal is determined largely by the sampling rate, or the bit rate the digital signal is sampled at. The higher the bit rate, the more samples are created per second, and the more realistic the resulting audio or video file will be. Since samples estimate the analog signal, the digital representation is never as accurate as the analog signal. However, if a high enough sampling rate is used, the difference is not noticeable to the human senses. Because digital information can be edited and saved using a computer and will not deteriorate like analog media, the quality/convenience tradeoff involved in sampling is well worthwhile.\nYou are on point with your reply. The difference in tuning is +10.\nThe actual number of samples required to create a theoretically perfect copy are ruled by the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. The math inside the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem could make your head spin, so we’ll paraphrase: the sampling rate must be at least twice the frequency recorded. For example, if you’re recording percussion, cymbals and the like, recorded frequencies and recorded frequencies's harmonics could easily reach 20,000Hz. This means the sampling rate required to recreate an accurate copy is 40,000Hz. A 32kHz sampling rate means the top of the recorded audio spectrum is 16,000Hz, which is fine for dialog and other duties.\nIf you’ve paid attention, you know that the CD audio specification requires a 44,100Hz sampling rate and DV video uses a 48,000Hz sampling rate. the CD audio specification actually calls for two sampling rates: 48kHz and 32kHz. If 44,100Hz and higher sampling rates are referred to as CD quality, The 32kHz (usually referred to as 12-bit) version would be FM radio quality.\nThe 48kHz (usually referred to as 16-bit) setting is the standard for two-channel or stereo recording. The 32kHz (usually referred to as 12-bit) version can record stereo as well, but it is also possible to record four simultaneous channels of audio on certain cameras. The Canon XL2 is the first camera that comes to mind in this category.

Think of the sample rate as the horizontal precision of the digital waveform, and the sample format as the vertical precision. The sampling rate should be at least twice the highest frequency you want to represent. e. bits per sample):.\nAn audio CD has a sample rate of 44,100 Hz, often written as 44 KHz for short. Humans can't hear frequencies above about 20,000 Hz, so 44,100 Hz was chosen as the rate for audio CDs to just include all human frequencies. Sample rates of 96 and 192 KHz are starting to become more common, particularly in DVD-Audio, but many people honestly can't hear the difference.\n44,100 Hz is also the default sample rate that Audacity uses, because audio CDs are so prevalent. An audio CD has a precision of 16 bits, which corresponds to about 5 decimal digits. If you are familiar with the decibel (dB) scale, the dynamic range on an audio CD is theoretically about 90 dB, but realistically signals that are -24 dB or more in volume are greatly reduced in quality.\nHigher sampling rates allow a digital recording to accurately record higher frequencies of sound. Higher sample sizes allow for more dynamic range - louder louds and softer softs.\nThe auxtype|\n|is normally the sample rate divided by 51. |\nAn introduction to sampling\nSampling is conceptually simple; an incoming analog sound signal is converted to a digital number (0-255 on the IIgs). Compact discs sample at 44,100 Hz, which means Compact discs can accurately track signals up to 22,050 Hz, beyond the range of human hearing.\n|\n|(See section CA for more on why this is). |\n|ACE||. |\n|ASIF||no std. ||$D8||Contains sample data plus additional data. |\n|Notable due to its use by SoundSmith. |\n|AIFF||.

Analog tape recorders do something very similar). Some effects which can be done include:\n- Cut and pasting parts of a sample around. - Mixing/overlaying two samples.\nGetting good samples depends on a number of factors:\n- Sampling rate. Sampling rate is how often in samples per second the incoming signal is actually noticed and saved. In general, you want to have a sampling rate of twice the frequency of the highest pitch sound you intend to sample. (The reasoning behind this is known as the Nyquist Sampling Theorem). Long-distance telephone calls are sampled at 8,000 Hz, since the characteristic part of human voices is generally from 1000-3000 Hz. If frequencies higher than or equal to half your sampling rate exist, frequencies higher than or equal to half your sampling rate will manifest as distortion in the output sample. - Input signal level (the higher the better, except that there is a threshold known as the 'clipping level' above which the sampler will be unable to track the signal. Once a sample is made, a sample can be this processing in a variety of ways via mathematics. Because this processing is digital, no degradation of the signal can occur, unlike with analog processing.\nAudio signals can be converted to digital information through a measurement process called sampling. After an audio signal is digitized, the samples can be organized in sequential order. In Matlab, the samples in an audio signal can be stored as the elements in an array.\nOne common, and useful, digital representation of an audio signal records the amplitude at regular intervals of time. Next, let’s look at several built-in functions for working with audio signals.\nOne common, and useful, digital representation of an audio signal is called pulse code modulation (PCM). Here are a few links to find out more about PCM: video, wikipedia.\nThe number of amplitude measurements, or samples, per second is called the sampling rate. For audio, common sampling rates include 44,100 samples/second (CD Audio) and 48,000 samples/second (DVD Audio).\nFirst, a function for importing an audio file stored on a computer’s hard drive into Matlab.\nThis method involved a lot of rewinding and fast-forwarding, which resulted in a time-consuming process. This process is called sampling. Sampling involves taking snapshots of an audio or video signal at very fast intervals, usually tens of thousands of times per second. Samples can be created by sampling live audio and video or by sampling previously recorded analog media.\nThe quality of the digital signal is determined largely by the sampling rate, or the bit rate the digital signal is sampled at. The higher the bit rate, the more samples are created per second, and the more realistic the resulting audio or video file will be. Since samples estimate the analog signal, the digital representation is never as accurate as the analog signal. However, if a high enough sampling rate is used, the difference is not noticeable to the human senses. Because digital information can be edited and saved using a computer and will not deteriorate like analog media, the quality/convenience tradeoff involved in sampling is well worthwhile.\nYou are on point with your reply. The difference in tuning is +10.\nThe actual number of samples required to create a theoretically perfect copy are ruled by the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. The math inside the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem could make your head spin, so we’ll paraphrase: the sampling rate must be at least twice the frequency recorded. For example, if you’re recording percussion, cymbals and the like, recorded frequencies and recorded frequencies's harmonics could easily reach 20,000Hz. This means the sampling rate required to recreate an accurate copy is 40,000Hz. A 32kHz sampling rate means the top of the recorded audio spectrum is 16,000Hz, which is fine for dialog and other duties.\nIf you’ve paid attention, you know that the CD audio specification requires a 44,100Hz sampling rate and DV video uses a 48,000Hz sampling rate. the CD audio specification actually calls for two sampling rates: 48kHz and 32kHz. If 44,100Hz and higher sampling rates are referred to as CD quality, The 32kHz (usually referred to as 12-bit) version would be FM radio quality.\nThe 48kHz (usually referred to as 16-bit) setting is the standard for two-channel or stereo recording. The 32kHz (usually referred to as 12-bit) version can record stereo as well, but it is also possible to record four simultaneous channels of audio on certain cameras. The Canon XL2 is the first camera that comes to mind in this category. Oddly, many camcorders default to The 32kHz (usually referred to as 12-bit) version although many camcorders cannot actually record four channels.\n\nContext Document 4: Here are some additional articles that provide more information on sampling rate and bit depth (i.\nThe geek speak here is that the highest-end audio files (which include WAV and AIFF formats) boast higher \"sampling rates\" and \"bit depths. \" Think of the sampling rate as how many \"snapshots\" of audio the music file has; the higher the sampling rate, the smoother and richer the music sounds. Bit depth is how much information each snapshot contains. So it's now easy to create digital song files at double the sampling rate and bit depth of CDs.\nMath nerds, feel free to look all this up on Wikipedia. Bit depth is more complicated to explain, so we’ll start with an analogy.\n\nContext Document 5: The Bit Rate can be 8, 16, 24 bit. 1KHz, 16bit. 1KHz. The 96KHz and 192KHz is mostly used for Blue Ray DVDs. 1KHz, 24bit.\nThis leaves plenty of wiggle room at the top end of the scale. That should keep you busy for a while. In digital imaging, there are three common bit depths: 8-bit, 16-bit and 24-bit. An 8-bit image has only 256 colors available. While you might never notice only 256 colors available in a cartoon image, an 8-bit sunset would look pretty strange. Since the colors are limited, you will see a great deal of banding in the gradient from the horizon up to the sky. A 16-bit image has a little more range – 65,536 colors to be exact.\nThe 32kHz (usually referred to as 12-bit) version’s fine for casual use, but not recommended for critical applications.\n----\nQuestion: What is the difference between the default sampling rate used in audio CDs versus the recommended sampling rate for improving amp sim sound quality?\nAnswer:", "answer": "The default sampling rate used in audio CDs is 44.1 kHz, while the recommended sampling rate for improving amp sim sound quality is 96 kHz.

In general, you want to have a sampling rate of twice the frequency of the highest pitch sound you intend to sample. (The reasoning behind this is known as the Nyquist Sampling Theorem). Long-distance telephone calls are sampled at 8,000 Hz, since the characteristic part of human voices is generally from 1000-3000 Hz. If frequencies higher than or equal to half your sampling rate exist, frequencies higher than or equal to half your sampling rate will manifest as distortion in the output sample. - Input signal level (the higher the better, except that there is a threshold known as the 'clipping level' above which the sampler will be unable to track the signal. Once a sample is made, a sample can be this processing in a variety of ways via mathematics. Because this processing is digital, no degradation of the signal can occur, unlike with analog processing.\nThe number of amplitude measurements, or samples, per second is called the sampling rate. For audio, common sampling rates include 44,100 samples/second (CD Audio) and 48,000 samples/second (DVD Audio).\nThis method involved a lot of rewinding and fast-forwarding, which resulted in a time-consuming process. This process is called sampling. Sampling involves taking snapshots of an audio or video signal at very fast intervals, usually tens of thousands of times per second. Samples can be created by sampling live audio and video or by sampling previously recorded analog media.\nThe quality of the digital signal is determined largely by the sampling rate, or the bit rate the digital signal is sampled at. The higher the bit rate, the more samples are created per second, and the more realistic the resulting audio or video file will be. Since samples estimate the analog signal, the digital representation is never as accurate as the analog signal. However, if a high enough sampling rate is used, the difference is not noticeable to the human senses. Because digital information can be edited and saved using a computer and will not deteriorate like analog media, the quality/convenience tradeoff involved in sampling is well worthwhile.\nThe actual number of samples required to create a theoretically perfect copy are ruled by the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. The math inside the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem could make your head spin, so we’ll paraphrase: the sampling rate must be at least twice the frequency recorded. For example, if you’re recording percussion, cymbals and the like, recorded frequencies and recorded frequencies's harmonics could easily reach 20,000Hz. This means the sampling rate required to recreate an accurate copy is 40,000Hz. A 32kHz sampling rate means the top of the recorded audio spectrum is 16,000Hz, which is fine for dialog and other duties.\nIf you’ve paid attention, you know that the CD audio specification requires a 44,100Hz sampling rate and DV video uses a 48,000Hz sampling rate. the CD audio specification actually calls for two sampling rates: 48kHz and 32kHz. If 44,100Hz and higher sampling rates are referred to as CD quality, The 32kHz (usually referred to as 12-bit) version would be FM radio quality.\nThe 48kHz (usually referred to as 16-bit) setting is the standard for two-channel or stereo recording. The 32kHz (usually referred to as 12-bit) version can record stereo as well, but it is also possible to record four simultaneous channels of audio on certain cameras. The Canon XL2 is the first camera that comes to mind in this category. Oddly, many camcorders default to The 32kHz (usually referred to as 12-bit) version although many camcorders cannot actually record four channels.\n\nContext Document 3: The bit depth determines the number of decimals in the sample which determines the accuracy of the sampling. (for example, 8 bits will result a sample with only 8 decimal numbers)\nAudio CD Quality\nAll Audio CD‘s are formated at 44. The default sample rate and bit resolution for Studio Pros custom studio tracks and productions is 44.\nBefore digital recording took over the audio and video industries, everything was recorded in analog. Audio was recorded to devices like cassette tapes and records. Video was recorded to Beta and VHS tapes. The media was even This method in analog format, using multichannel audio tapes (such as 8-tracks) for music, and film reels for video recordings. Fortunately, digital recording has now almost completely replaced analog recording. Digital editing can be done much more efficiently than analog editing and the media does not lose any quality in the process. However, since what humans see and hear is in analog format (linear waves of light and sound), saving audio and video in a digital format requires This process the signal from analog to digital. For example, CD-quality audio is sampled at 44. 1 kHz, or 44,100 samples per second. The difference between a 44. 1 kHz digital recording and the original audio signal is imperceptible to most people. However, if the audio was recorded at 22 kHz (half the CD-quality rate), most people would notice the drop in quality right away.

That might strike you as a bit lazy, until you think about what a 44. Having said all that, present technology still isn’t able to examine the whole signal and in recognition of this, the process is called ‘sampling’ (or ‘dipping in and out’ for a look, if you like).\nThe minimum sampling rate needed is twice the highest frequency of the spectrum of the signal you wish to measure. I'm involved a lot with sampling analogue signals and we place a minimum sampling rate at 2. Under-sampling is to be avoided unless you are designing (eg) software radios which rely on under-sampling as a means for demodulation. Strictly speaking, both CDs and the systems I work on \"over-sample\" and of course everyone else does to a lesser or greater extent.

Research has shown that recording your audio at a higher sample rate (such as 48KHz or 96KHz) and then dithering your audio back to 44. Recording at this rate will ensure your song will be recorded at the highest quality possible.\nThis is because the harmonics generated by distortion can interact with a digital system’s clock frequency and create audible artifacts that usually add a “wooliness” to the sound. Higher sampling rates, however, can produce a clearer sound.\nBut recording at a higher sample rate isn’t always practical, because it stresses your computer more. This can cause reduced track counts, or less stable operation.

Otherwise, do sample-rate conversion in a separate program (such as Audacity) prior to importing.\nFrom the Audacity Digital Audio Tutorial :\nThe main device used in digital recording is a Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). The ADC captures a snapshot of the electric voltage on an audio line and represents the electric voltage on an audio line as a digital number that can be sent to a computer. By capturing the electric voltage on an audio line thousands of times per second, you can get a very good approximation to the original audio signal:\nEach dot in the figure above represents one audio sample. Audacity supports two additional sample sizes: 24-bit, which is commonly used in digital recording, and 32-bit float, which has almost infinite dynamic range, and only takes up twice as much storage as 16-bit samples.\nThere are two factors that determine the quality of a digital recording:\nSample rate: The rate at which the samples are captured or played back, measured in Hertz (Hz), or samples per second. Sample format or sample size: Essentially Sample format or sample size is the number of digits in the digital representation of each sample. Think of the sample rate as the horizontal precision of the digital waveform, and the sample format as the vertical precision. The sampling rate should be at least twice the highest frequency you want to represent. e. bits per sample):.\nAn audio CD has a sample rate of 44,100 Hz, often written as 44 KHz for short. Humans can't hear frequencies above about 20,000 Hz, so 44,100 Hz was chosen as the rate for audio CDs to just include all human frequencies. Sample rates of 96 and 192 KHz are starting to become more common, particularly in DVD-Audio, but many people honestly can't hear the difference.\n44,100 Hz is also the default sample rate that Audacity uses, because audio CDs are so prevalent. An audio CD has a precision of 16 bits, which corresponds to about 5 decimal digits. If you are familiar with the decibel (dB) scale, the dynamic range on an audio CD is theoretically about 90 dB, but realistically signals that are -24 dB or more in volume are greatly reduced in quality.\nHigher sampling rates allow a digital recording to accurately record higher frequencies of sound. Higher sample sizes allow for more dynamic range - louder louds and softer softs.\nACE||$CD||Contains raw sample data compressed with ACE,|\n|Apple's Tool029 sound compressor.

Some effects which can be done include:\n- Cut and pasting parts of a sample around. - Mixing/overlaying two samples.\nGetting good samples depends on a number of factors:\n- Sampling rate. Sampling rate is how often in samples per second the incoming signal is actually noticed and saved. In general, you want to have a sampling rate of twice the frequency of the highest pitch sound you intend to sample. (The reasoning behind this is known as the Nyquist Sampling Theorem). Long-distance telephone calls are sampled at 8,000 Hz, since the characteristic part of human voices is generally from 1000-3000 Hz.

Because this processing is digital, no degradation of the signal can occur, unlike with analog processing.\nThe number of amplitude measurements, or samples, per second is called the sampling rate. For audio, common sampling rates include 44,100 samples/second (CD Audio) and 48,000 samples/second (DVD Audio).\nOn a Windows computer, enter the Control Panel then enter the Sound settings. On the Playback tab the preferred output device, such as the Berkeley Audio Design Alpha USB in this case, should be listed. Enter the properties of the preferred output device, such as the Berkeley Audio Design Alpha USB in this case by selecting the preferred output device, such as the Berkeley Audio Design Alpha USB in this case and clicking the Properties button. Select the Levels tab and make sure the volume is set to 100.\nFor CD quality audio, the bandwidth is extended out beyond 20 kHz, as being better than the average healthy human's auditory bandwidth. So, for CD-quality audio, the standard sample rate is 44.\nOne of the features of sampled signals is the idea of aliasing. aliasing is a form of distortion where higher frequency components, when sampled, appear \"folded\" (in the frequency domain) into lower frequency artefacts. In order to minimise aliasing the designer has to decide the effective bandwidth of the designer's system and enforce the effective bandwidth of their system. The first is to place a low-pass filter on the input signal, commonly known as an anti-aliasing filter, and the second is to select the sampling frequency correctly. This is done by calculating the Nyquist Rate, which is twice the highest frequency component required in the input signal. This means that the Nyquist Frequency (the upper limit for input frequency components that don't produce aliasing effects) is 22. In practice this approach has to be constrained by the economics of the application and the nature of the actual processing that is going to take place once the signal has been sampled and quantised.\nThat is done in two ways. But. Similarly, increasing the sample rate can have a commensurate effect.\n1 kHz. 05 kHz.\nSince the upper threshold for a normal adult with healthy hearing tops out at around 15 kHz, this means that an economical linear anti-aliasing filter can be produced to eliminate sufficient aliasing components for good listening quality. a great deal of expense and time is usually outside the range of all but the richest DIYers. If, however, the goal is to manipulate CV signals for modular synthesis, far cheaper approaches are available to the layperson.\nTherefore, the design goals for any chosen ADC would appear to be very simple - this approach the sample rate and the number of bits and you can't go wrong. For those new to the idea of digital sampling, I'm sure it comes as no surprise that increasing the resolution of your ADC has a direct correlation with the increase in cost of your components. If the goal is to produce high definition audio (where resolutions of 20- and 24-bits are sampled at 48 kHz, 96 kHz, 192 kHz and beyond), a great deal of expense and time will have to be spent on components and board design for analog input stages, converters and DSP processors.\nWhat sound card are you using? Sounds as if Windows might have had Windows's own idea as to what the sample rate was set to as opposed to what you thought Audition expecting. How far out is the pitch and timing? If you have Windows Sounds turned on turn Windows Sounds off as any sounds that Windows tries to play, like email arrival, will change the sample rate to play without asking for Audition's approval,\nI posted my question without searching the forum first as it is recommended. I use a sequencer program that has some audio editing capability and all plays well with in a sequencer program that has some audio editing capability, but WAV files created in a sequencer program that has some audio editing capability cannot be played at all in Win Media Player and when played in AA, WAV files created in it played fast. You may also have to set one rate as a default in the Sounds section of the OS.\nYou are on point with your reply. The difference in tuning is +10.\nWin-7 changed the sampling rate, but oddly only for AA. 70. Win-7 resampling is an unholy nightmare. Win-7 does resampling without asking you, and Win-7 doesn't do a very good job of resampling, although there's a downloadable M$ patch that helps somewhat.\nWhen I changed the sampling rate, all worked well. My sound card is Echo Fire8. I think that the only realistic answer to these problems is to decide to work at one rate only, and using your sound device's options panel, lock the card to one rate. If you do all of your recording at one rate only, then all of your recording should all play back at one rate only.\n1 kHz with 33. 1 kHz and at 48 kHz.

Most deconvolution based impulse response measurement methods, including the log sweep method, are quite robust and noise insensitive, but cause all sorts of artifacts when non harmonic but signal related distortion is introduced, even at quite low levels. 5), thus preserving the impulse response quality.\nYou can download a simple program with about the same functionality of the measure script from:\nMost cheap game oriented soundcards often include a sample rate converter in Most cheap game oriented soundcards's design, so that input streams running at different sample rates can be played together by resampling input streams running at different sample rates at the maximum sample rate supported by the soundcard DAC. Usually the maximum sample rate supported by the soundcard DAC is 48 kHz as defined by the AC97 standard. Despite this, most of the times good measurements are possible even out of cheap soundcards if the maximum sample rate supported by the DAC is used, usually 48 kHz, so that the soundcard internal sample rate converter isn’t used at all.\nThese sample rate converters often are of abysmal quality, causing all sort of aliasing artifacts. The aliasing artifacts introduced by low quality sample rate converters are exactly of this kind and are one of the most common cause of poor quality impulse response measurements and consequently of correction artifacts.\nYou can change the impulse response sample rate after the measurement using high quality software sample rate conversion algorithms (see section 4. To check the quality of the impulse response measurement perform a loopback measurement, without using a reference channel else any measurement problem will be washed out by the reference channel compensation.\nThe impulse response you get must be a single clean spike much similar to that of a CD Player (see for example the upper graph of picture 88, labeled “Dirac delta”). A bit of ringing before and/or after the main spike is normal, but anything else is just an artifact.\nBefore digital recording took over the audio and video industries, everything was recorded in analog.

Higher rates look even closer. 48kHz is 48,000 samples per second and 96kHz is 96,000 per second — and so on. The ‘Right’ Sample Rate & Bit Depth Before you do any audio sessions you’ll need to either set the sample rate and bit depth you want or your DAW software will use the default values determined by your soundcard. A simple rule: the higher your sample rate and greater your bit depth, the better the quality of the recording, but it comes at a cost of using more CPU and RAM resources (see below).\nThe more the converters see, the greater the accuracy in reproducing the original sound source. They do know how to apply the facts to their recording sessions and that’s all that matters. Save As Options This is Sound Forge’s Save As dialogue which also acts as a file conversion facility. It offers all the various quality settings and formats for file resolutions. Some of the lower settings are almost obsolete now. Low values reduced the size of the file, which might be helpful, especially if the audio might be something simple that didn’t need high quality reproduction. Nowadays, compression algorithms like MP3 are used instead. Some of the conversions will let you open the files in programs that will otherwise not recognise the files.\nAlthough higher sample rates are capturing frequencies we theoretically can’t hear, higher sample rates are capturing the harmonics (superhigh overtones) of the fundamental notes, providing the listener with a more detailed sound stage.\nIf the highest frequency in the spectrum of the signal you wish to measure is 10kHz then you need to sample at least twice as high (20,000 times per second) in order to avoid aliasing. EDIT - following the amendment by the OP: -\nIf we want to measure 50 Hz AC signal, we set ADC's sample rate to\n1000 Hz, and sample 10 cycles, that is (1000 Hz / 50 Hz) x 10 = 200\nsamples.\nMost folk go a bit better than at least twice as high (20,000 times per second) and, for instance, CD's sample audio at 44. 1k samples per second and expect to be able to reproduce an audio spectrum that goes from DC to 20kHz. 1k samples per second's 2.\n44. 205 times higher than 20kHz.\nHere's an example picture: -\nan example picture shows a benefit for oversampling in that the filtering used to recover an audio signal after a DAC is more easily designed and uses fewer components (take my word for it). So, the benefit of over-sampling is: -\n- improved signal-to-noise ratio,\n- ability to recover signals that are less than one quantization step in amplitude (called dithering and also used in digital audio on CDs),\n- simpler reconstruction filters (analogue and digital domain),\n- DAC sinc-compensation filter less likely to be needed.\n5 times to make reconstruction of the signal after leaving the DAC a relatively easy process. This is what happens: -\nThe red signal is the original and The red signal is under-sampled at the blue-dot points - when The red signal is reconstructed by a low pass filter the blue signal is generated and clearly the blue signal does not look like The red signal! If you sampled a sine wave exactly at twice a sine wave's frequency then you'll get a dc level somewhere between -pk and +pk.\nIf the result is not good, increase the cycles to 100, etc.\nThe sampling rate for audio is the equivalent to the refresh rate for video. In audio, The sampling rate for audio is the number of times a second that the sound input is recorded and saved. The sample rate of an audio recording is a good indicator of the overall sound quality. With the same measurement unit as The refresh rate, The sample rate of an audio recording is a noticeably higher number for a sampling rate for audio.\n1kHz, where bit-depth is higher than CD quality but sampling rate is the same, and vice versa. So what do the numbers mean? It might help to think of an audio signal as a sound wave being plotted on a graph. Sampling rate – the second number – refers to the number of times per second that the wave is measured during the analogue-to-digital conversion process. The higher the sampling rate, the more times the audio signal has been sampled, and thus the more detail resolution you get. The first number is bit-depth, which indicates the number of 'bits' of information present in each sample of the signal.", "score": 5.21118950843811, "doc_IDs": ["<urn:uuid:b5df770b-3d45-47c3-b0ba-75d977980555>", "<urn:uuid:97ab9040-61be-4bf2-a7ca-397c36267266>", "<urn:uuid:575c60f2-f30c-481e-baa5-217dc097e907>", "<urn:uuid:60b50f9e-88c1-47dc-9a00-65c072ffc639>", "<urn:uuid:df213533-bb38-4cc7-92ff-ed5467618dbd>", "<urn:uuid:e35e88e2-ae19-4f7f-8039-7e87b3bc1798>", "<urn:uuid:df6eef1e-1fd0-41d9-bf07-20794ecaa051>", "<urn:uuid:4434c908-fd2d-4a07-8c5f-704e160c496a>", "<urn:uuid:f9e45f74-a745-4794-b336-8d3f6d817637>", "<urn:uuid:5fb08d52-aee8-43d3-a06f-05dea98e4381>", "<urn:uuid:afd1fa87-e807-4410-b5eb-c758d8ce824d>", "<urn:uuid:6c313f09-bfa0-4492-a856-4b5cf451526f>", "<urn:uuid:2d8e7cbc-dad2-42f5-beea-78ba06f3a2ec>", "<urn:uuid:4c4d2f35-e05b-45e2-b11e-4b21c568e93b>", "<urn:uuid:5c8b3db8-7fcf-4e69-a5b2-3be5ea06a96b>", "<urn:uuid:cf25518b-3b14-44b7-8999-9b791033a8de>"]}, {"passage": "The Bit Rate can be 8, 16, 24 bit. 1KHz, 16bit. 1KHz.

Some amp sims have an internal oversampling option.\nThe auxtype|\n|is normally the sample rate divided by 51. |\nAn introduction to sampling\nSampling is conceptually simple; an incoming analog sound signal is converted to a digital number (0-255 on the IIgs). Compact discs sample at 44,100 Hz, which means Compact discs can accurately track signals up to 22,050 Hz, beyond the range of human hearing.\nIn SLAVE mode, all Sampling Rates up to 192 kHz are supported. In MASTER mode, the typical Sampling Rate supported is 44.\nChris Birkinshaw created a modified version of the measure script which adds Jack support. a modified version of the measure script which adds Jack support is named “measurejack” and you can find a modified version of the measure script which adds Jack support under the “source/contrib/MeasureJack” directory of the standard distribution. For informations about Jack take a look at:\nFinally Ed Wildgoose created a simple program with about the same functionality of the measure script. a simple program with about the same functionality of the measure script works also under Windows and being written in C, instead of being a simple shell script, a simple program with about the same functionality of the measure script is less dependent on other tools and usually provides a more reliable functionality.\nThe geek speak here is that the highest-end audio files (which include WAV and AIFF formats) boast higher \"sampling rates\" and \"bit depths. \" Think of the sampling rate as how many \"snapshots\" of audio the music file has; the higher the sampling rate, the smoother and richer the music sounds. Bit depth is how much information each snapshot contains. So it's now easy to create digital song files at double the sampling rate and bit depth of CDs.\nThe actual number of samples required to create a theoretically perfect copy are ruled by the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. The math inside the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem could make your head spin, so we’ll paraphrase: the sampling rate must be at least twice the frequency recorded. For example, if you’re recording percussion, cymbals and the like, recorded frequencies and recorded frequencies's harmonics could easily reach 20,000Hz. This means the sampling rate required to recreate an accurate copy is 40,000Hz. A 32kHz sampling rate means the top of the recorded audio spectrum is 16,000Hz, which is fine for dialog and other duties.\nInstead, it takes only a ‘sample’ (or microscopic slice) of the signal and assumes that the parts it misses won’t make a great deal of difference. That might strike you as a bit lazy, until you think about what a 44. Having said all that, present technology still isn’t able to examine the whole signal and in recognition of this, the process is called ‘sampling’ (or ‘dipping in and out’ for a look, if you like).\nThe minimum sampling rate needed is twice the highest frequency of the spectrum of the signal you wish to measure. I'm involved a lot with sampling analogue signals and we place a minimum sampling rate at 2. Under-sampling is to be avoided unless you are designing (eg) software radios which rely on under-sampling as a means for demodulation. Strictly speaking, both CDs and the systems I work on \"over-sample\" and of course everyone else does to a lesser or greater extent. I'm not going to go too deep into this as you are probably a beginner in over-sampling but please ask if you need more info.\nBelow, we try to help you decide just that, starting with the differences between lossless and hi-res music, and offering a breakdown of the services and the services's USPs.

Studio Pros highly recommend recording your songs at 44.\nFortunately, the workaround may be simple. 1kHz project, using your amp sim and preset of choice. • After recording your part, save the amp sim preset. • Load the amp sim and the amp sim's preset.\nEssentially, the sim the sim itself runs at a higher sample rate than the project hosting the sim itself.

Studio Pros always recommend recording your song in the highest bit rate possible – 24bit.\nThat’s where we get the term: sample rate. The sample rate can be anywhere from 8KHz (Kilohertz – 8,000 times per second) up to 192KHz. Q: When should I record at 48KHz 96KHz or 192KHz?\nA: 48KHz sample rate is the default sample rate for TV and film tracks.\nThe bit depth determines the number of decimals in the sample which determines the accuracy of the sampling. (for example, 8 bits will result a sample with only 8 decimal numbers)\nAudio CD Quality\nAll Audio CD‘s are formated at 44. The default sample rate and bit resolution for Studio Pros custom studio tracks and productions is 44.\n1KHz, 16bit, why should my final song be recorded at a higher sample rate and bit resolution?”\nA: That process the sample rate from a high sample rate to a lower sample rate (for example: 96KHz to 44. 1KHz) can slightly modify your final recording. 1KHz doesn’t improve the sound of the recording and even cause slight distortion.\nThat process is called: “dithering”, and is part of the mastering process. Research has shown that recording your audio at a higher sample rate (such as 48KHz or 96KHz) and then dithering your audio back to 44. Recording at this rate will ensure your song will be recorded at the highest quality possible.\nThis is because the harmonics generated by distortion can interact with a digital system’s clock frequency and create audible artifacts that usually add a “wooliness” to the sound. Higher sampling rates, however, can produce a clearer sound.\nBut recording at a higher sample rate isn’t always practical, because it stresses your computer more. This can cause reduced track counts, or less stable operation. Closer to a single curved line is better (Apple QuickTime Pro 7.\ninfinitewave. 1 kHz. 1kHz.\nca shows sample rate conversion quality for all major programs. Otherwise, do sample-rate conversion in a separate program (such as Audacity) prior to importing.\nFrom the Audacity Digital Audio Tutorial :\nThe main device used in digital recording is a Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). The ADC captures a snapshot of the electric voltage on an audio line and represents the electric voltage on an audio line as a digital number that can be sent to a computer. By capturing the electric voltage on an audio line thousands of times per second, you can get a very good approximation to the original audio signal:\nEach dot in the figure above represents one audio sample. Audacity supports two additional sample sizes: 24-bit, which is commonly used in digital recording, and 32-bit float, which has almost infinite dynamic range, and only takes up twice as much storage as 16-bit samples.\nThere are two factors that determine the quality of a digital recording:\nSample rate: The rate at which the samples are captured or played back, measured in Hertz (Hz), or samples per second. Sample format or sample size: Essentially Sample format or sample size is the number of digits in the digital representation of each sample. Think of the sample rate as the horizontal precision of the digital waveform, and the sample format as the vertical precision. The sampling rate should be at least twice the highest frequency you want to represent. e. bits per sample):.\nAn audio CD has a sample rate of 44,100 Hz, often written as 44 KHz for short. Humans can't hear frequencies above about 20,000 Hz, so 44,100 Hz was chosen as the rate for audio CDs to just include all human frequencies. Sample rates of 96 and 192 KHz are starting to become more common, particularly in DVD-Audio, but many people honestly can't hear the difference.\n44,100 Hz is also the default sample rate that Audacity uses, because audio CDs are so prevalent. An audio CD has a precision of 16 bits, which corresponds to about 5 decimal digits. If you are familiar with the decibel (dB) scale, the dynamic range on an audio CD is theoretically about 90 dB, but realistically signals that are -24 dB or more in volume are greatly reduced in quality.\nHigher sampling rates allow a digital recording to accurately record higher frequencies of sound. Higher sample sizes allow for more dynamic range - louder louds and softer softs.\nACE||$CD||Contains raw sample data compressed with ACE,|\n|Apple's Tool029 sound compressor. Used by HyperCard|\n|IIgs and the Sound CDev. - Stereo card quality and shielding (the Audio Animator makes the best samples of any card I've tried, by far). Analog tape recorders do something very similar). Some effects which can be done include:\n- Cut and pasting parts of a sample around. - Mixing/overlaying two samples.\nGetting good samples depends on a number of factors:\n- Sampling rate. Sampling rate is how often in samples per second the incoming signal is actually noticed and saved. In general, you want to have a sampling rate of twice the frequency of the highest pitch sound you intend to sample. (The reasoning behind this is known as the Nyquist Sampling Theorem). Long-distance telephone calls are sampled at 8,000 Hz, since the characteristic part of human voices is generally from 1000-3000 Hz. If frequencies higher than or equal to half your sampling rate exist, frequencies higher than or equal to half your sampling rate will manifest as distortion in the output sample. - Input signal level (the higher the better, except that there is a threshold known as the 'clipping level' above which the sampler will be unable to track the signal. Once a sample is made, a sample can be this processing in a variety of ways via mathematics. Because this processing is digital, no degradation of the signal can occur, unlike with analog processing.\nThe number of amplitude measurements, or samples, per second is called the sampling rate. For audio, common sampling rates include 44,100 samples/second (CD Audio) and 48,000 samples/second (DVD Audio).\nOn a Windows computer, enter the Control Panel then enter the Sound settings. On the Playback tab the preferred output device, such as the Berkeley Audio Design Alpha USB in this case, should be listed. Enter the properties of the preferred output device, such as the Berkeley Audio Design Alpha USB in this case by selecting the preferred output device, such as the Berkeley Audio Design Alpha USB in this case and clicking the Properties button. Select the Levels tab and make sure the volume is set to 100.\nFor CD quality audio, the bandwidth is extended out beyond 20 kHz, as being better than the average healthy human's auditory bandwidth. So, for CD-quality audio, the standard sample rate is 44.\nOne of the features of sampled signals is the idea of aliasing. aliasing is a form of distortion where higher frequency components, when sampled, appear \"folded\" (in the frequency domain) into lower frequency artefacts. In order to minimise aliasing the designer has to decide the effective bandwidth of the designer's system and enforce the effective bandwidth of their system. The first is to place a low-pass filter on the input signal, commonly known as an anti-aliasing filter, and the second is to select the sampling frequency correctly. This is done by calculating the Nyquist Rate, which is twice the highest frequency component required in the input signal. This means that the Nyquist Frequency (the upper limit for input frequency components that don't produce aliasing effects) is 22. In practice this approach has to be constrained by the economics of the application and the nature of the actual processing that is going to take place once the signal has been sampled and quantised.\nThat is done in two ways. But. Similarly, increasing the sample rate can have a commensurate effect.\n1 kHz. 05 kHz.\nSince the upper threshold for a normal adult with healthy hearing tops out at around 15 kHz, this means that an economical linear anti-aliasing filter can be produced to eliminate sufficient aliasing components for good listening quality. a great deal of expense and time is usually outside the range of all but the richest DIYers. If, however, the goal is to manipulate CV signals for modular synthesis, far cheaper approaches are available to the layperson.\nTherefore, the design goals for any chosen ADC would appear to be very simple - this approach the sample rate and the number of bits and you can't go wrong. For those new to the idea of digital sampling, I'm sure it comes as no surprise that increasing the resolution of your ADC has a direct correlation with the increase in cost of your components. If the goal is to produce high definition audio (where resolutions of 20- and 24-bits are sampled at 48 kHz, 96 kHz, 192 kHz and beyond), a great deal of expense and time will have to be spent on components and board design for analog input stages, converters and DSP processors.\nWhat sound card are you using? Sounds as if Windows might have had Windows's own idea as to what the sample rate was set to as opposed to what you thought Audition expecting. How far out is the pitch and timing? If you have Windows Sounds turned on turn Windows Sounds off as any sounds that Windows tries to play, like email arrival, will change the sample rate to play without asking for Audition's approval,\nI posted my question without searching the forum first as it is recommended. I use a sequencer program that has some audio editing capability and all plays well with in a sequencer program that has some audio editing capability, but WAV files created in a sequencer program that has some audio editing capability cannot be played at all in Win Media Player and when played in AA, WAV files created in it played fast. You may also have to set one rate as a default in the Sounds section of the OS.\nYou are on point with your reply. The difference in tuning is +10.\nWin-7 changed the sampling rate, but oddly only for AA. 70. Win-7 resampling is an unholy nightmare. Win-7 does resampling without asking you, and Win-7 doesn't do a very good job of resampling, although there's a downloadable M$ patch that helps somewhat.\nWhen I changed the sampling rate, all worked well. My sound card is Echo Fire8. I think that the only realistic answer to these problems is to decide to work at one rate only, and using your sound device's options panel, lock the card to one rate. If you do all of your recording at one rate only, then all of your recording should all play back at one rate only.\n1 kHz with 33. 1 kHz and at 48 kHz.

Most deconvolution based impulse response measurement methods, including the log sweep method, are quite robust and noise insensitive, but cause all sorts of artifacts when non harmonic but signal related distortion is introduced, even at quite low levels. 5), thus preserving the impulse response quality.\nYou can download a simple program with about the same functionality of the measure script from:\nMost cheap game oriented soundcards often include a sample rate converter in Most cheap game oriented soundcards's design, so that input streams running at different sample rates can be played together by resampling input streams running at different sample rates at the maximum sample rate supported by the soundcard DAC. Usually the maximum sample rate supported by the soundcard DAC is 48 kHz as defined by the AC97 standard. Despite this, most of the times good measurements are possible even out of cheap soundcards if the maximum sample rate supported by the DAC is used, usually 48 kHz, so that the soundcard internal sample rate converter isn’t used at all.\nThese sample rate converters often are of abysmal quality, causing all sort of aliasing artifacts. The aliasing artifacts introduced by low quality sample rate converters are exactly of this kind and are one of the most common cause of poor quality impulse response measurements and consequently of correction artifacts.\nYou can change the impulse response sample rate after the measurement using high quality software sample rate conversion algorithms (see section 4. To check the quality of the impulse response measurement perform a loopback measurement, without using a reference channel else any measurement problem will be washed out by the reference channel compensation.\nThe impulse response you get must be a single clean spike much similar to that of a CD Player (see for example the upper graph of picture 88, labeled “Dirac delta”). A bit of ringing before and/or after the main spike is normal, but anything else is just an artifact.\nBefore digital recording took over the audio and video industries, everything was recorded in analog. Audio was recorded to devices like cassette tapes and records. Video was recorded to Beta and VHS tapes. The media was even This method in analog format, using multichannel audio tapes (such as 8-tracks) for music, and film reels for video recordings. Fortunately, digital recording has now almost completely replaced analog recording. Digital editing can be done much more efficiently than analog editing and the media does not lose any quality in the process. However, since what humans see and hear is in analog format (linear waves of light and sound), saving audio and video in a digital format requires This process the signal from analog to digital. For example, CD-quality audio is sampled at 44. 1 kHz, or 44,100 samples per second. The difference between a 44. 1 kHz digital recording and the original audio signal is imperceptible to most people. However, if the audio was recorded at 22 kHz (half the CD-quality rate), most people would notice the drop in quality right away. Updated: January 8, 2016.\nThis method involved a lot of rewinding and fast-forwarding, which resulted in a time-consuming process. This process is called sampling. Sampling involves taking snapshots of an audio or video signal at very fast intervals, usually tens of thousands of times per second. Samples can be created by sampling live audio and video or by sampling previously recorded analog media.\nThe quality of the digital signal is determined largely by the sampling rate, or the bit rate the digital signal is sampled at. The higher the bit rate, the more samples are created per second, and the more realistic the resulting audio or video file will be. Since samples estimate the analog signal, the digital representation is never as accurate as the analog signal. However, if a high enough sampling rate is used, the difference is not noticeable to the human senses. Because digital information can be edited and saved using a computer and will not deteriorate like analog media, the quality/convenience tradeoff involved in sampling is well worthwhile.\nIf you’ve paid attention, you know that the CD audio specification requires a 44,100Hz sampling rate and DV video uses a 48,000Hz sampling rate. the CD audio specification actually calls for two sampling rates: 48kHz and 32kHz. If 44,100Hz and higher sampling rates are referred to as CD quality, The 32kHz (usually referred to as 12-bit) version would be FM radio quality.\nThe 48kHz (usually referred to as 16-bit) setting is the standard for two-channel or stereo recording. The 32kHz (usually referred to as 12-bit) version can record stereo as well, but it is also possible to record four simultaneous channels of audio on certain cameras. The Canon XL2 is the first camera that comes to mind in this category. Oddly, many camcorders default to The 32kHz (usually referred to as 12-bit) version although many camcorders cannot actually record four channels.\n1kHz ‘CD quality’ sampling rate means: a 44. 1kHz ‘CD quality’ sampling rate ‘looks’ at the audio 44,100 times per second… there’s not a lot left untouched. Higher rates look even closer. 48kHz is 48,000 samples per second and 96kHz is 96,000 per second — and so on. The ‘Right’ Sample Rate & Bit Depth Before you do any audio sessions you’ll need to either set the sample rate and bit depth you want or your DAW software will use the default values determined by your soundcard. A simple rule: the higher your sample rate and greater your bit depth, the better the quality of the recording, but it comes at a cost of using more CPU and RAM resources (see below).\nThe more the converters see, the greater the accuracy in reproducing the original sound source. They do know how to apply the facts to their recording sessions and that’s all that matters. Save As Options This is Sound Forge’s Save As dialogue which also acts as a file conversion facility. It offers all the various quality settings and formats for file resolutions. Some of the lower settings are almost obsolete now. Low values reduced the size of the file, which might be helpful, especially if the audio might be something simple that didn’t need high quality reproduction. Nowadays, compression algorithms like MP3 are used instead. Some of the conversions will let you open the files in programs that will otherwise not recognise the files.\nAlthough higher sample rates are capturing frequencies we theoretically can’t hear, higher sample rates are capturing the harmonics (superhigh overtones) of the fundamental notes, providing the listener with a more detailed sound stage.\nIf the highest frequency in the spectrum of the signal you wish to measure is 10kHz then you need to sample at least twice as high (20,000 times per second) in order to avoid aliasing. EDIT - following the amendment by the OP: -\nIf we want to measure 50 Hz AC signal, we set ADC's sample rate to\n1000 Hz, and sample 10 cycles, that is (1000 Hz / 50 Hz) x 10 = 200\nsamples.\nMost folk go a bit better than at least twice as high (20,000 times per second) and, for instance, CD's sample audio at 44. 1k samples per second and expect to be able to reproduce an audio spectrum that goes from DC to 20kHz. 1k samples per second's 2.\n44. 205 times higher than 20kHz.\nHere's an example picture: -\nan example picture shows a benefit for oversampling in that the filtering used to recover an audio signal after a DAC is more easily designed and uses fewer components (take my word for it). So, the benefit of over-sampling is: -\n- improved signal-to-noise ratio,\n- ability to recover signals that are less than one quantization step in amplitude (called dithering and also used in digital audio on CDs),\n- simpler reconstruction filters (analogue and digital domain),\n- DAC sinc-compensation filter less likely to be needed.\n5 times to make reconstruction of the signal after leaving the DAC a relatively easy process. This is what happens: -\nThe red signal is the original and The red signal is under-sampled at the blue-dot points - when The red signal is reconstructed by a low pass filter the blue signal is generated and clearly the blue signal does not look like The red signal! If you sampled a sine wave exactly at twice a sine wave's frequency then you'll get a dc level somewhere between -pk and +pk.\nIf the result is not good, increase the cycles to 100, etc.\nThe sampling rate for audio is the equivalent to the refresh rate for video. In audio, The sampling rate for audio is the number of times a second that the sound input is recorded and saved. The sample rate of an audio recording is a good indicator of the overall sound quality. With the same measurement unit as The refresh rate, The sample rate of an audio recording is a noticeably higher number for a sampling rate for audio.\n1kHz, where bit-depth is higher than CD quality but sampling rate is the same, and vice versa. So what do the numbers mean? It might help to think of an audio signal as a sound wave being plotted on a graph. Sampling rate – the second number – refers to the number of times per second that the wave is measured during the analogue-to-digital conversion process. The higher the sampling rate, the more times the audio signal has been sampled, and thus the more detail resolution you get. The first number is bit-depth, which indicates the number of 'bits' of information present in each sample of the signal.\n\nContext Document 4: The Bit Rate can be 8, 16, 24 bit. 1KHz, 16bit. 1KHz. The 96KHz and 192KHz is mostly used for Blue Ray DVDs. 1KHz, 24bit.\nHere are some additional articles that provide more information on sampling rate and bit depth (i.\nHowever, upon user special request, we will accomodate all of the following sampling rates:\nFull 24 bit resolution is supported at all frequencies. Digital Deemphasis is supported at 44. These formats are not supported.\nThis leaves plenty of wiggle room at the top end of the scale. That should keep you busy for a while. In digital imaging, there are three common bit depths: 8-bit, 16-bit and 24-bit. An 8-bit image has only 256 colors available. While you might never notice only 256 colors available in a cartoon image, an 8-bit sunset would look pretty strange. Since the colors are limited, you will see a great deal of banding in the gradient from the horizon up to the sky. A 16-bit image has a little more range – 65,536 colors to be exact.\nMath nerds, feel free to look all this up on Wikipedia. Bit depth is more complicated to explain, so we’ll start with an analogy.\nThe 32kHz (usually referred to as 12-bit) version’s fine for casual use, but not recommended for critical applications.\nSo a hi-res file can be 24-bit/44.\n\nContext Document 5: |Feb 12, 2013, 10:24 AM||#1|\niTunes Plus vs Custom setting\nFor iTunes, when importing music, is there any difference between using the \"default\" iTunes Plus setting vs using \"custom\" with settings of AAC; bit rate 256 kbps; sample rate auto; channels auto; VBR checked on?\nIn both instances the Import \"details\" box show almost the same: 128 kbps (mono)/256 kbps (stereo), VBR, optimized for MMX/SSE2.

The sample rate can be anywhere from 8KHz (Kilohertz – 8,000 times per second) up to 192KHz. Q: When should I record at 48KHz 96KHz or 192KHz?\nA: 48KHz sample rate is the default sample rate for TV and film tracks.\nAn audio CD has a sample rate of 44,100 Hz, often written as 44 KHz for short. Humans can't hear frequencies above about 20,000 Hz, so 44,100 Hz was chosen as the rate for audio CDs to just include all human frequencies. Sample rates of 96 and 192 KHz are starting to become more common, particularly in DVD-Audio, but many people honestly can't hear the difference.\n44,100 Hz is also the default sample rate that Audacity uses, because audio CDs are so prevalent. An audio CD has a precision of 16 bits, which corresponds to about 5 decimal digits. If you are familiar with the decibel (dB) scale, the dynamic range on an audio CD is theoretically about 90 dB, but realistically signals that are -24 dB or more in volume are greatly reduced in quality.\nThe auxtype|\n|is normally the sample rate divided by 51. |\nAn introduction to sampling\nSampling is conceptually simple; an incoming analog sound signal is converted to a digital number (0-255 on the IIgs). Compact discs sample at 44,100 Hz, which means Compact discs can accurately track signals up to 22,050 Hz, beyond the range of human hearing.\nThe number of amplitude measurements, or samples, per second is called the sampling rate. For audio, common sampling rates include 44,100 samples/second (CD Audio) and 48,000 samples/second (DVD Audio).\nFor CD quality audio, the bandwidth is extended out beyond 20 kHz, as being better than the average healthy human's auditory bandwidth. So, for CD-quality audio, the standard sample rate is 44.\nThe actual number of samples required to create a theoretically perfect copy are ruled by the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. The math inside the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem could make your head spin, so we’ll paraphrase: the sampling rate must be at least twice the frequency recorded. For example, if you’re recording percussion, cymbals and the like, recorded frequencies and recorded frequencies's harmonics could easily reach 20,000Hz. This means the sampling rate required to recreate an accurate copy is 40,000Hz. A 32kHz sampling rate means the top of the recorded audio spectrum is 16,000Hz, which is fine for dialog and other duties.\nIf you’ve paid attention, you know that the CD audio specification requires a 44,100Hz sampling rate and DV video uses a 48,000Hz sampling rate. the CD audio specification actually calls for two sampling rates: 48kHz and 32kHz.

The aliasing artifacts introduced by low quality sample rate converters are exactly of this kind and are one of the most common cause of poor quality impulse response measurements and consequently of correction artifacts.\nThe impulse response you get must be a single clean spike much similar to that of a CD Player (see for example the upper graph of picture 88, labeled “Dirac delta”). A bit of ringing before and/or after the main spike is normal, but anything else is just an artifact.\nHere's an example picture: -\nan example picture shows a benefit for oversampling in that the filtering used to recover an audio signal after a DAC is more easily designed and uses fewer components (take my word for it). So, the benefit of over-sampling is: -\n- improved signal-to-noise ratio,\n- ability to recover signals that are less than one quantization step in amplitude (called dithering and also used in digital audio on CDs),\n- simpler reconstruction filters (analogue and digital domain),\n- DAC sinc-compensation filter less likely to be needed.\n5 times to make reconstruction of the signal after leaving the DAC a relatively easy process. This is what happens: -\nThe red signal is the original and The red signal is under-sampled at the blue-dot points - when The red signal is reconstructed by a low pass filter the blue signal is generated and clearly the blue signal does not look like The red signal! If you sampled a sine wave exactly at twice a sine wave's frequency then you'll get a dc level somewhere between -pk and +pk.\n\nContext Document 5: Higher sampling rates allow a digital recording to accurately record higher frequencies of sound. Higher sample sizes allow for more dynamic range - louder louds and softer softs.\nThat is done in two ways. But. Similarly, increasing the sample rate can have a commensurate effect.\nAlthough higher sample rates are capturing frequencies we theoretically can’t hear, higher sample rates are capturing the harmonics (superhigh overtones) of the fundamental notes, providing the listener with a more detailed sound stage.\nThe sampling rate for audio is the equivalent to the refresh rate for video. In audio, The sampling rate for audio is the number of times a second that the sound input is recorded and saved. The sample rate of an audio recording is a good indicator of the overall sound quality. With the same measurement unit as The refresh rate, The sample rate of an audio recording is a noticeably higher number for a sampling rate for audio.\n----\nQuestion: What is the difference between the default sampling rate used in audio CDs versus the recommended sampling rate for improving amp sim sound quality?\nAnswer:", "answer": "The default sampling rate used in audio CDs is 44.1 kHz, while the recommended sampling rate for improving amp sim sound quality is 44 kHz.

The sample rate can be anywhere from 8KHz (Kilohertz – 8,000 times per second) up to 192KHz. Q: When should I record at 48KHz 96KHz or 192KHz?\nA: 48KHz sample rate is the default sample rate for TV and film tracks.\nAn audio CD has a sample rate of 44,100 Hz, often written as 44 KHz for short. Humans can't hear frequencies above about 20,000 Hz, so 44,100 Hz was chosen as the rate for audio CDs to just include all human frequencies. Sample rates of 96 and 192 KHz are starting to become more common, particularly in DVD-Audio, but many people honestly can't hear the difference.\n44,100 Hz is also the default sample rate that Audacity uses, because audio CDs are so prevalent. An audio CD has a precision of 16 bits, which corresponds to about 5 decimal digits. If you are familiar with the decibel (dB) scale, the dynamic range on an audio CD is theoretically about 90 dB, but realistically signals that are -24 dB or more in volume are greatly reduced in quality.\nThe auxtype|\n|is normally the sample rate divided by 51. |\nAn introduction to sampling\nSampling is conceptually simple; an incoming analog sound signal is converted to a digital number (0-255 on the IIgs). Compact discs sample at 44,100 Hz, which means Compact discs can accurately track signals up to 22,050 Hz, beyond the range of human hearing.\nThe number of amplitude measurements, or samples, per second is called the sampling rate. For audio, common sampling rates include 44,100 samples/second (CD Audio) and 48,000 samples/second (DVD Audio).\nFor CD quality audio, the bandwidth is extended out beyond 20 kHz, as being better than the average healthy human's auditory bandwidth. So, for CD-quality audio, the standard sample rate is 44.\nThe actual number of samples required to create a theoretically perfect copy are ruled by the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. The math inside the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem could make your head spin, so we’ll paraphrase: the sampling rate must be at least twice the frequency recorded. For example, if you’re recording percussion, cymbals and the like, recorded frequencies and recorded frequencies's harmonics could easily reach 20,000Hz. This means the sampling rate required to recreate an accurate copy is 40,000Hz. A 32kHz sampling rate means the top of the recorded audio spectrum is 16,000Hz, which is fine for dialog and other duties.\nIf you’ve paid attention, you know that the CD audio specification requires a 44,100Hz sampling rate and DV video uses a 48,000Hz sampling rate. the CD audio specification actually calls for two sampling rates: 48kHz and 32kHz. If 44,100Hz and higher sampling rates are referred to as CD quality, The 32kHz (usually referred to as 12-bit) version would be FM radio quality.\nThe minimum sampling rate needed is twice the highest frequency of the spectrum of the signal you wish to measure. I'm involved a lot with sampling analogue signals and we place a minimum sampling rate at 2. Under-sampling is to be avoided unless you are designing (eg) software radios which rely on under-sampling as a means for demodulation. Strictly speaking, both CDs and the systems I work on \"over-sample\" and of course everyone else does to a lesser or greater extent. I'm not going to go too deep into this as you are probably a beginner in over-sampling but please ask if you need more info.\nIf the highest frequency in the spectrum of the signal you wish to measure is 10kHz then you need to sample at least twice as high (20,000 times per second) in order to avoid aliasing.

We struggle with questions like: Why should we bother with sampling rates that improve performance outside the human hearing limit? Why don't we just stop at 16 bit (enough dynamic range to mask the noise floor) and 44. You should read this short and very clear article, but to summarize John Siau of Benchmark Audio's main point: If audio equipment is designed to roll off -2 dB at 20 kHz (typical specs), by the time you've run through a lot of those stages (source file, preamp, amp, speaker) you've accumulated a total roll off of about -8 dB, and a total roll off of about -8 dB exteneds far into the audible hearing range. If we increase the sampling rate to 192 kHz and the performance of all equipment to perform well out to around 100 kHz (getting rid of intermodulation distortion and other non-linearities that can cause audible artifacts), then the cumulative high-end roll-off happening in the audible hearing range is vastly decreased.\n1 kHz (get us the 20 Hz - 20 kHz spectrum)? Didn't we arrive at best-practices in 1979 when the CD's bit depth and sampling rate were found to bring us the best sound possible?\nIn this short and very clear article, John Siau of Benchmark Audio explains how gear designed to work well at higher sampling rates like 192 kHz and at frequencies as high as 100 kHz can improve system performance: What is High Resolution Audio - Part 2. Is this why we as a community have started to work at 96 kHz? Is this why certain consoles that are designed to remain linear to very high rates (250 kHz) such as Neve's are so coveted as key elements today's hybrid analog-digital rigs? Is this why re-clocking digital systems to reduce jitter came into fashion? Is this what Neil Young's is hearing when Neil Young's says 192 kHz is better?.\nSignals must be filtered prior to sampling. Theortically the maximum frequency that can be represented is half the sampling frequency. In practice a higher sample rate is used to allow for non-ideal filters. The signal is now represented at multiples of the sampling period, T, as s(nT) which is also written.\nThe speed and depth at which the samples are recorded also determine the final digital track’s quality. Thus, the sampling rate and depth values give an idea of the quality of the recording. It is also called speed and measured in kHz (kilohertz). 1 kHz, which is used on CDs. 1 kHz, which is used on CDs is usually used as optimal. 1 kHz, which is used on CDs as the minimum sample rate. The bit depth determines how many bits of information will be contained in each sample on digital recordings. This, in turn, gives us an understanding of the recording’s resolution and detail. CDs use 16-bit depth, which is the minimum requirement for your microphone.\nBut because the sampling rates which are available on your computer in programs like Reason and Live are related to the soundcard you are using you probably will not be able to choose a sampling rate which is higher than 192 kHz, or maybe even lower. My Focusrite soundcard offers 96 kHz as the highest sampling rate, same as when I use the build-in card of my MacBook Pro Retina. Using higher sampling rates will stress your system a LOT! It will be hard to use higher sampling rates in combination with low latency. But there’s a workaround of course: only use higher sampling rates when exporting the song. I won’t go into all the technical details between both methods, please read this excellent article if you’re interested in learning the difference between both methods. 1 kHz sampling rate.

Answer the following question using only the context provided below.\n\n----\nContext Document 1: Q: “If my final song is going to be in 44. Studio Pros highly recommend recording your songs at 44.\nRegardless of whether you think playing back audio at 96kHz sounds better than 44. 1kHz, recording at 96kHz can improve some amp sims’ sound—specifically, those without an oversampling option. Some amp sims have an internal oversampling option.\nFortunately, the workaround may be simple. 1kHz project, using your amp sim and preset of choice. • After recording your part, save the amp sim preset. • Load the amp sim and the amp sim's preset.\nEssentially, the sim the sim itself runs at a higher sample rate than the project hosting the sim itself. So check the sim itself's preferences for an Oversampling, High Resolution, or Higher CPU Consumption setting. (Avoid power-saving “eco” options. For more information, see “Checked Your Sim Preferences Lately?” in the July 2014 Guitar Player). If your sim doesn’t have these options, there’s a workaround.\n• Record your guitar track as you normally would in the 44. • Open a new project set to 96kHz, and import your guitar track starting at the project beginning.\n• Regardless of where you started recording your guitar track, extend your guitar track's beginning—even if its beginning’s silence—to the project start. This may require dragging the clip start to the beginning, or inserting silence.\n• Export the dry guitar track without processing by the sim at 96kHz, assuming your host program has quality sample-rate conversion (Fig. Otherwise, export at 44. If you couldn’t export at 96kHz, some hosts will convert when importing. • Render (bounce) the file with the amp sim sound, and then export the processed file at 44.\n\nContext Document 2: That’s where we get the term: sample rate. The sample rate can be anywhere from 8KHz (Kilohertz – 8,000 times per second) up to 192KHz. Q: When should I record at 48KHz 96KHz or 192KHz?\nA: 48KHz sample rate is the default sample rate for TV and film tracks.\nAn audio CD has a sample rate of 44,100 Hz, often written as 44 KHz for short. Humans can't hear frequencies above about 20,000 Hz, so 44,100 Hz was chosen as the rate for audio CDs to just include all human frequencies. Sample rates of 96 and 192 KHz are starting to become more common, particularly in DVD-Audio, but many people honestly can't hear the difference.\n44,100 Hz is also the default sample rate that Audacity uses, because audio CDs are so prevalent. An audio CD has a precision of 16 bits, which corresponds to about 5 decimal digits. If you are familiar with the decibel (dB) scale, the dynamic range on an audio CD is theoretically about 90 dB, but realistically signals that are -24 dB or more in volume are greatly reduced in quality.\nThe auxtype|\n|is normally the sample rate divided by 51. |\nAn introduction to sampling\nSampling is conceptually simple; an incoming analog sound signal is converted to a digital number (0-255 on the IIgs). Compact discs sample at 44,100 Hz, which means Compact discs can accurately track signals up to 22,050 Hz, beyond the range of human hearing.\nThe number of amplitude measurements, or samples, per second is called the sampling rate. For audio, common sampling rates include 44,100 samples/second (CD Audio) and 48,000 samples/second (DVD Audio).\nFor CD quality audio, the bandwidth is extended out beyond 20 kHz, as being better than the average healthy human's auditory bandwidth. So, for CD-quality audio, the standard sample rate is 44.\nThe actual number of samples required to create a theoretically perfect copy are ruled by the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem. The math inside the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem could make your head spin, so we’ll paraphrase: the sampling rate must be at least twice the frequency recorded. For example, if you’re recording percussion, cymbals and the like, recorded frequencies and recorded frequencies's harmonics could easily reach 20,000Hz. This means the sampling rate required to recreate an accurate copy is 40,000Hz. A 32kHz sampling rate means the top of the recorded audio spectrum is 16,000Hz, which is fine for dialog and other duties.\nIf you’ve paid attention, you know that the CD audio specification requires a 44,100Hz sampling rate and DV video uses a 48,000Hz sampling rate. the CD audio specification actually calls for two sampling rates: 48kHz and 32kHz. If 44,100Hz and higher sampling rates are referred to as CD quality, The 32kHz (usually referred to as 12-bit) version would be FM radio quality.\nThe minimum sampling rate needed is twice the highest frequency of the spectrum of the signal you wish to measure. I'm involved a lot with sampling analogue signals and we place a minimum sampling rate at 2. Under-sampling is to be avoided unless you are designing (eg) software radios which rely on under-sampling as a means for demodulation. Strictly speaking, both CDs and the systems I work on \"over-sample\" and of course everyone else does to a lesser or greater extent. I'm not going to go too deep into this as you are probably a beginner in over-sampling but please ask if you need more info.\nIf the highest frequency in the spectrum of the signal you wish to measure is 10kHz then you need to sample at least twice as high (20,000 times per second) in order to avoid aliasing. EDIT - following the amendment by the OP: -\nIf we want to measure 50 Hz AC signal, we set ADC's sample rate to\n1000 Hz, and sample 10 cycles, that is (1000 Hz / 50 Hz) x 10 = 200\nsamples.\nMost folk go a bit better than at least twice as high (20,000 times per second) and, for instance, CD's sample audio at 44. 1k samples per second and expect to be able to reproduce an audio spectrum that goes from DC to 20kHz. 1k samples per second's 2.\n\nContext Document 3: The bit depth determines the number of decimals in the sample which determines the accuracy of the sampling. (for example, 8 bits will result a sample with only 8 decimal numbers)\nAudio CD Quality\nAll Audio CD‘s are formated at 44. The default sample rate and bit resolution for Studio Pros custom studio tracks and productions is 44.\nMath nerds, feel free to look all this up on Wikipedia. Bit depth is more complicated to explain, so we’ll start with an analogy.\n1kHz, where bit-depth is higher than CD quality but sampling rate is the same, and vice versa. So what do the numbers mean? It might help to think of an audio signal as a sound wave being plotted on a graph. Sampling rate – the second number – refers to the number of times per second that the wave is measured during the analogue-to-digital conversion process. The higher the sampling rate, the more times the audio signal has been sampled, and thus the more detail resolution you get.
