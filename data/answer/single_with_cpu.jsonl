In digital imaging, there are three common bit depths: 8-bit, 16-bit and 24-bit. An 8-bit image has only 256 colors available. While you might never notice only 256 colors available in a cartoon image, an 8-bit sunset would look pretty strange.

The refresh rate is also known as: \"vertical refresh rate\", or \"vertical scan rate for CRTs. For a CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) this is the number of times the ray draws from the top corner of the screen to the opposite bottom corner, in one second. There are instances that The refresh rate is called the sampling rate interchangeably.\nThe refresh rate refers to the number of times in a second that a display is fully lit up. It is measured in hertz. It is this phenomenon that causes the bar on a screen that is seen on a television show as the refresh rate is not enough to compensate for the intermediate frames taken by the camera. This is in contrast to a frame rate, which is the number of frames shown per second. Whereas if a monitor has a 48Hz refresh rate and the show is at a 24 frame rate, then the screen will be lit up twice for each frame that appears on the screen.\n1kHz. 1kHz, where bit-depth is higher than CD quality but sampling rate is the same, and vice versa. So what do the numbers mean? It might help to think of an audio signal as a sound wave being plotted on a graph. Sampling rate – the second number – refers to the number of times per second that the wave is measured during the analogue-to-digital conversion process. The higher the sampling rate, the more times the audio signal has been sampled, and thus the more detail resolution you get.

Getting good samples depends on a number of factors:\n- Sampling rate. Sampling rate is how often in samples per second the incoming signal is actually noticed and saved. In general, you want to have a sampling rate of twice the frequency of the highest pitch sound you intend to sample. (The reasoning behind this is known as the Nyquist Sampling Theorem). Compact discs sample at 44,100 Hz, which means Compact discs can accurately track signals up to 22,050 Hz, beyond the range of human hearing. Long-distance telephone calls are sampled at 8,000 Hz, since the characteristic part of human voices is generally from 1000-3000 Hz. If frequencies higher than or equal to half your sampling rate exist, frequencies higher than or equal to half your sampling rate will manifest as distortion in the output sample. - Input signal level (the higher the better, except that there is a threshold known as the 'clipping level' above which the sampler will be unable to track the signal. Once a sample is made, a sample can be this processing in a variety of ways via mathematics. Because this processing is digital, no degradation of the signal can occur, unlike with analog processing.\n70. Win-7 resampling is an unholy nightmare. Win-7 does resampling without asking you, and Win-7 doesn't do a very good job of resampling, although there's a downloadable M$ patch that helps somewhat.\nDigital Deemphasis is supported at 44. These formats are not supported.\nA longer sweep will improve the S/N ratio of the impulse response, increasing the resolution instead will provide no benefit at all. These sample rate converters often are of abysmal quality, causing all sort of aliasing artifacts. Most deconvolution based impulse response measurement methods, including the log sweep method, are quite robust and noise insensitive, but cause all sorts of artifacts when non harmonic but signal related distortion is introduced, even at quite low levels. The aliasing artifacts introduced by low quality sample rate converters are exactly of this kind and are one of the most common cause of poor quality impulse response measurements and consequently of correction artifacts. You can change the impulse response sample rate after the measurement using high quality software sample rate conversion algorithms (see section 4. 5), thus preserving the impulse response quality. To check the quality of the impulse response measurement perform a loopback measurement, without using a reference channel else any measurement problem will be washed out by the reference channel compensation. The impulse response you get must be a single clean spike much similar to that of a CD Player (see for example the upper graph of picture 88, labeled “Dirac delta”). A bit of ringing before and/or after the main spike is normal, but anything else is just an artifact.\nChris Birkinshaw created a modified version of the measure script which adds Jack support. a modified version of the measure script which adds Jack support is named “measurejack” and you can find a modified version of the measure script which adds Jack support under the “source/contrib/MeasureJack” directory of the standard distribution. For informations about Jack take a look at:\nFinally Ed Wildgoose created a simple program with about the same functionality of the measure script. a simple program with about the same functionality of the measure script works also under Windows and being written in C, instead of being a simple shell script, a simple program with about the same functionality of the measure script is less dependent on other tools and usually provides a more reliable functionality.\nQ: What bit rate should I use for balance between quality and filesize?\nA: Depends oh how sensitive ur ears are. But if u want my suggestion, 192kbps (constant) is a good setting. Q: What bit rate should I use for best quality?

Question is, can u really\nhear the diff between 256kbps or lower bit rates and 320kbps mp3 files? If so, then go ahead and encode at 320kbps. If you\nwant my suggestion, 256kbps is enough!\nQ: Will converting my low quality mp3's to wav then encode my low quality mp3's back to mp3 at\na higher bit rate increase my low quality mp3's's sound quality?\nA: Nope!

The more the converters see, the greater the accuracy in reproducing the original sound source. A simple rule: the higher your sample rate and greater your bit depth, the better the quality of the recording, but it comes at a cost of using more CPU and RAM resources (see below).\nAlthough higher sample rates are capturing frequencies we theoretically can’t hear, higher sample rates are capturing the harmonics (superhigh overtones) of the fundamental notes, providing the listener with a more detailed sound stage. They do know how to apply the facts to their recording sessions and that’s all that matters. The ‘Right’ Sample Rate & Bit Depth Before you do any audio sessions you’ll need to either set the sample rate and bit depth you want or your DAW software will use the default values determined by your soundcard.\nSave As Options This is Sound Forge’s Save As dialogue which also acts as a file conversion facility.

Getting good samples depends on a number of factors:\n- Sampling rate. Sampling rate is how often in samples per second the incoming signal is actually noticed and saved. In general, you want to have a sampling rate of twice the frequency of the highest pitch sound you intend to sample. (The reasoning behind this is known as the Nyquist Sampling Theorem). Compact discs sample at 44,100 Hz, which means Compact discs can accurately track signals up to 22,050 Hz, beyond the range of human hearing. Long-distance telephone calls are sampled at 8,000 Hz, since the characteristic part of human voices is generally from 1000-3000 Hz. If frequencies higher than or equal to half your sampling rate exist, frequencies higher than or equal to half your sampling rate will manifest as distortion in the output sample. - Input signal level (the higher the better, except that there is a threshold known as the 'clipping level' above which the sampler will be unable to track the signal. Once a sample is made, a sample can be this processing in a variety of ways via mathematics. Because this processing is digital, no degradation of the signal can occur, unlike with analog processing.\n70. Win-7 resampling is an unholy nightmare.

These formats are not supported.\nA longer sweep will improve the S/N ratio of the impulse response, increasing the resolution instead will provide no benefit at all. These sample rate converters often are of abysmal quality, causing all sort of aliasing artifacts. Most deconvolution based impulse response measurement methods, including the log sweep method, are quite robust and noise insensitive, but cause all sorts of artifacts when non harmonic but signal related distortion is introduced, even at quite low levels. The aliasing artifacts introduced by low quality sample rate converters are exactly of this kind and are one of the most common cause of poor quality impulse response measurements and consequently of correction artifacts. You can change the impulse response sample rate after the measurement using high quality software sample rate conversion algorithms (see section 4. 5), thus preserving the impulse response quality. To check the quality of the impulse response measurement perform a loopback measurement, without using a reference channel else any measurement problem will be washed out by the reference channel compensation. The impulse response you get must be a single clean spike much similar to that of a CD Player (see for example the upper graph of picture 88, labeled “Dirac delta”). A bit of ringing before and/or after the main spike is normal, but anything else is just an artifact.\nChris Birkinshaw created a modified version of the measure script which adds Jack support. a modified version of the measure script which adds Jack support is named “measurejack” and you can find a modified version of the measure script which adds Jack support under the “source/contrib/MeasureJack” directory of the standard distribution.

The math inside the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem could make your head spin, so we’ll paraphrase: the sampling rate must be at least twice the frequency recorded. For example, if you’re recording percussion, cymbals and the like, recorded frequencies and recorded frequencies's harmonics could easily reach 20,000Hz. This means the sampling rate required to recreate an accurate copy is 40,000Hz. If you’ve paid attention, you know that the CD audio specification requires a 44,100Hz sampling rate and DV video uses a 48,000Hz sampling rate. the CD audio specification actually calls for two sampling rates: 48kHz and 32kHz. The 48kHz (usually referred to as 16-bit) setting is the standard for two-channel or stereo recording. The 32kHz (usually referred to as 12-bit) version can record stereo as well, but it is also possible to record four simultaneous channels of audio on certain cameras. The Canon XL2 is the first camera that comes to mind in this category. A 32kHz sampling rate means the top of the recorded audio spectrum is 16,000Hz, which is fine for dialog and other duties. If 44,100Hz and higher sampling rates are referred to as CD quality, The 32kHz (usually referred to as 12-bit) version would be FM radio quality. The 32kHz (usually referred to as 12-bit) version’s fine for casual use, but not recommended for critical applications. Oddly, many camcorders default to The 32kHz (usually referred to as 12-bit) version although many camcorders cannot actually record four channels.\nHigher rates look even closer. The more the converters see, the greater the accuracy in reproducing the original sound source. A simple rule: the higher your sample rate and greater your bit depth, the better the quality of the recording, but it comes at a cost of using more CPU and RAM resources (see below).\nThe minimum sampling rate needed is twice the highest frequency of the spectrum of the signal you wish to measure. If the highest frequency in the spectrum of the signal you wish to measure is 10kHz then you need to sample at least twice as high (20,000 times per second) in order to avoid aliasing. This is what happens: -\nThe red signal is the original and The red signal is under-sampled at the blue-dot points - when The red signal is reconstructed by a low pass filter the blue signal is generated and clearly the blue signal does not look like The red signal!

If 44,100Hz and higher sampling rates are referred to as CD quality, The 32kHz (usually referred to as 12-bit) version would be FM radio quality. The 32kHz (usually referred to as 12-bit) version’s fine for casual use, but not recommended for critical applications. Oddly, many camcorders default to The 32kHz (usually referred to as 12-bit) version although many camcorders cannot actually record four channels.\nHigher rates look even closer. The more the converters see, the greater the accuracy in reproducing the original sound source. A simple rule: the higher your sample rate and greater your bit depth, the better the quality of the recording, but it comes at a cost of using more CPU and RAM resources (see below).\nThe minimum sampling rate needed is twice the highest frequency of the spectrum of the signal you wish to measure. If the highest frequency in the spectrum of the signal you wish to measure is 10kHz then you need to sample at least twice as high (20,000 times per second) in order to avoid aliasing. This is what happens: -\nThe red signal is the original and The red signal is under-sampled at the blue-dot points - when The red signal is reconstructed by a low pass filter the blue signal is generated and clearly the blue signal does not look like The red signal! If you sampled a sine wave exactly at twice a sine wave's frequency then you'll get a dc level somewhere between -pk and +pk. EDIT - following the amendment by the OP: -\nIf we want to measure 50 Hz AC signal, we set ADC's sample rate to\n1000 Hz, and sample 10 cycles, that is (1000 Hz / 50 Hz) x 10 = 200\nsamples.\n\n\n    Strict Instructions:\n    1.
