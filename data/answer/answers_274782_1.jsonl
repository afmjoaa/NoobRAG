{"id": 121, "question": "How many calories should be added to a breastfeeding woman's daily diet?", "passages": [{"passage": "The energy cost of exclusive breastfeeding from birth through six months postpartum is approximately 170 kcal per day. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for energy is 330 kcal per day. Breastfeeding burns a large number of calories, potentially more than a hard workout, but requires a daily intake of at least 500 calories or more than a pre-pregnancy diet. Lean protein and healthy fats are essential for weight loss during breastfeeding.

Improvements in depression, anxiety, and impairment were more pronounced in the acupuncture group. Additionally, studies suggest acupuncture's effects on PTSD may be mediated through the central nervous system, as evidenced by fMRI and PET studies showing changes in the limbic system. The NADA Five Point Protocol, an auricular acupuncture treatment, has also been found effective for PTSD and substance addictions. However, research on acupuncture for PTSD is limited."}

{"id": 236, "question": "gas types drilling mud explained", "passages": [{"passage": "Gas cut mud indicates a possible kick, classified into connection gases resulting from reduced mud column pressure during connections. Mud degassing equipment features include simple operation, high efficiency, minimal moving parts, large gas exchange surface, easy maintenance, direct gas exhaust, and environmental friendliness. Equipment specifications: weight 1451-1587 KG, total lead area 7.7-3.7 M2. Acoustic borehole televiewers work in oil or water-based fluids. Salt saturation in mud systems is achieved by adding sodium chloride. Drilling mud vibrating screens remove solids from mud. Mud pumps are classified by type (duplex, triplex, quintuplex) and power source (fuel engine, electric). The onshore fuel engine segment is expected to grow significantly. Sawdust with viscosifier additives affects oil-based drilling mud properties. Laboratory tests compare water-based and oil-based mud performance during CO2 gas kicks.

Gaudí's buildings in Barcelona lack corners, and he communicated designs without modern architecture programs. The Italian Mafia was suspected in the theft of Vincent van Gogh's \"Gachet,\" valued at $20 million. \"Gachet\" is one of van Gogh's most revered paintings, selling for $3 million. The Morse code and telegraph followed van Gogh's era. Armand Roulin's portrait depicts him in a fedora and yellow jacket. Paul Gachet cared for van Gogh after his injury. Goeneutte's painting includes a mother hiding her child's face during a dangerous scene. Goeneutte worked with Dr. Paul Gachet on publications and exhibited a portrait of him. Dutch and French artists depicted ship dangers from a distance. The Nazis initiated an anti-smoking movement.\n\nContext Document 3: Key Information:\n\n1.

The study investigates the effect of a directed exercise program on joint discomfort and stiffness in women with ER positive breast cancer taking aromatase inhibitors. Risk factors for breast cancer include being female, age, prior breast cancer diagnosis, family history, inherited genes, radiation exposure, obesity, early period start, and high bone mass. Hormone receptors in breast cancer cells bind to specific hormones, potentially triggering cell division and tumor growth. Estrogen and progesterone are key hormones interacting with breast cancer cells. The Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool helps determine breast cancer risk. Absolute risk, relative risk, and attributable risk are types of risk discussed in breast cancer research. Bio-Identical Estrogen and Progesterone are safer than synthetic forms.

Oxidation levels range from 10-35% in Chinese Oolongs to 60-70% in Taiwanese Oolongs. The oxidation process, often inaccurately called fermentation, involves bruising the leaves to enable natural oxidation reactions. Oolong tea contains polyphenols, minerals, caffeine, and theanine, contributing to its calming and relaxing effects.\n\nOolong tea's caffeine content is approximately 37 mg per 8 fl oz, placing it between green and black teas in terms of caffeine levels. Theanine, an amino acid, is also present in oolong tea, providing relaxation benefits.\n\nOolong tea is produced through a meticulous process involving withering, oxidation, and drying stages. Tea masters often participate in competitions to showcase their skills in this fine art.

Tea production: withering, rolling, resting period for oxidation.\n4. Taiwanese Oolong: best quality and affordability, depends on fermentation degree.\n5. Oolong versions: variety for consumers, some highly fermented undergo wetting and softening.\n6. Oolong main process: withering, stir fixation, fry fixation, rolling, baking.\n7. Black tea oxidation: polyphenol oxidases form brown pigments, develops color and aroma.\n8. Green tea: fresh, clean-tasting, more subtle flavor than black.\n9. Tea benefits: reduces blood platelet aggregation, lowers risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\nContext Document 2: Oolong tea is made from the Camellia sinensis plant and can be oxidized to varying degrees, affecting its color, flavor, and caffeine content. Oxidation levels range from 10-35% in Chinese Oolongs to 60-70% in Taiwanese Oolongs. The oxidation process, often inaccurately called fermentation, involves bruising the leaves to enable natural oxidation reactions. Oolong tea contains polyphenols, minerals, caffeine, and theanine, contributing to its calming and relaxing effects.\n\nOolong tea's caffeine content is approximately 37 mg per 8 fl oz, placing it between green and black teas in terms of caffeine levels. Theanine, an amino acid, is also present in oolong tea, providing relaxation benefits.\n\nOolong tea is produced through a meticulous process involving withering, oxidation, and drying stages. Tea masters often participate in competitions to showcase their skills in this fine art. Good quality oolong tea is loose leaf, not tea bags.\n\nOolong tea offers health benefits, including improved cardiovascular, mental, muscular, and bone health.

This results in a circulating current due to the difference in voltage levels. The system manages this current by using reactors (inductors) to limit the circulating current, ensuring that the load current is not interrupted. The vacuum switch facilitates the making and breaking of current during this process, while the bypass switch operates without ever making or breaking the load current. This sequence helps maintain stable operation and prevents damage to the transformer and connected equipment."}

Decreasing Secchi depth suggests declining water clarity. Regular monitoring helps distinguish short-term variations from long-term changes, aiding in understanding underlying causes. The Cumbrian Lakes monitoring program, initiated in 1945, provides the most comprehensive long-term data globally. Water quality parameters such as phosphorous, oxygen, and chlorophyll a are crucial for evaluating ecosystem health. High levels of these substances can lead to eutrophication. Aeration can improve water quality and reduce algae problems in lakes. Air quality monitoring includes temperature, net radiation, atmospheric pressure, wind speed/direction, and carbon dioxide levels, serving as indicators of human impact and ecosystem health.\n\nContext Document 2: The MONOCLE device measures Secchi depth and water color. Brewtek partnered with MONOCLE for enhanced data analysis. The device is compact and suitable for nature excursions. Wind conditions require additional weight. Transparency is affected by nutrients from sewage, fertilizers, and wind-borne debris. Variable fluorescence indicates high algal photosynthetic activity. Epifluorescent analysis shows better light-harvesting pigments in deeper algae cells. Oxygen production is 7 gO2 m-2. The \"State of the Lake Report 2011\" discusses phytoplankton depth maximum mechanisms and aquatic invasive species control. Secchi clarity measurements show uncertain future trends. Reducing nutrients and sediment improves lake clarity. Citizen Lake Monitoring Network uses volunteer data for water quality analysis and satellite calibration. High chlorophyll a concentrations indicate poor water quality in Lake Simcoe. PACE mission data helps monitor harmful algal blooms. In North Lake, Western Australia, Microcystis growth is limited by nitrogen. Sediment nutrient release is significant at high pH. Chlorophyll determinations are global across various water bodies. Excessive phytoplankton growth leads to eutrophication and fish kills. Agricultural land dominance in lake watersheds increases primary production and nutrient flux. Recent studies show a 74-acre lake meeting state standards and removed from the impaired\n\nContext Document 3: The MACC encourages participation in their volunteer monitoring program for tracking water quality changes. Secchi depth data from 2002-2013 at Lake Macatawa indicates water clarity fluctuations. Lake ecosystems serve as indicators of environmental change. The CEH supports a community-based water quality monitoring program led by Mr. John Pottie. High phosphorus concentrations (up to 170µg l-1) were observed in 2009. Physical and chemical parameters like phosphorus, oxygen, hydrogen ions, and chlorophyll a are measured. Additional tests may include pesticide residues and hormone disrupters. Poor water circulation in lakes can lead to oxygen depletion due to excessive nutrient release. Research is needed to define new IDF standards for assessing water safety. Downstream effects of impoundment are not fully understood, especially for small systems. Pollutants are removed from water before it drains into a container. PCBs can be transported long distances through air deposition. Innovative regulations are needed to maintain water quality in rapidly changing regions.

Higher attainments like Sotāpatti, Sakadāgāmi, Anāgāmi, and Arahatta phala were possible with The Buddha's Teaching as Enlightened Buddha. Shin Buddhism, according to Thai scholar P. Payutto, lacks emphasis on self-effort and should not be called Buddhism. Lord Jigten Sumgon's legacy includes five aspects crucial for enlightenment: Faith, Diligence, Mindfulness of Buddha, Concentration, and Wisdom. Early Buddhism's four noble truths include suffering, its cause, cessation in nirvana, and the eightfold path. Buddhism describes reality in terms of process and relation, asserting non-self (anatman) and accepting samsara. The Gateway to Knowledge unifies Buddha Shakyamuni’s teachings, embodying Prajnaparamita, Madhyamika, and Abhidharma from Mahayana and Hinayana perspectives.

However, his teachings emphasize the importance of practicing both sutra and mantra methods, stressing the necessity of an ethical foundation and mental control gained through the sutra approach. He also classified teachings and practices into sutra (exoteric) and mantra (esoteric) approaches, indicating a comprehensive view of Buddhist practice that likely encompasses understanding and avoiding pitfalls such as the six mistakes mentioned."}

Papers published in these Proceedings are abridged to allow for subsequent journal publication.\n\nChatgpt assisted in literature review, data analysis, and discussion for a student's research. Notable universities like NYU and MIT are integrating similar technologies into their academic programs.\n\nA literature review primarily involves formal academic writing, such as a master’s thesis, dissertation, or peer-reviewed journal article. It includes crafting and applying search strategies, using alert functions, and identifying journals for publication. Argumentative and analytical research paper formats are used to present two sides of a controversial issue.\n\nInterpretive papers in Humanities, Social Sciences, and Literature cover emerging research, trends, opinions, and contrasting expert viewpoints. Panels must have a cohesive theme and promote discussions.\n\nTitles in various fields, including life, health, physical sciences, social sciences, and humanities, are ranked at the forefront of their fields. Literature reviews organize and present existing research, helping to identify areas for further research.\n\nA\n\nContext Document 2: The context discusses the process of writing a thesis, emphasizing the distinction between a research proposal and a research report. Both documents share similar outlines but differ significantly in content and purpose. A research proposal is a preliminary document that outlines the intended research, including the problem, objectives, methodology, and expected outcomes. It requires a literature review to demonstrate familiarity with existing research and identify gaps to be addressed. The proposal should be concise, coherent, and compelling, with a clear rationale for the chosen supervisor and methodology.\n\nA research report, on the other hand, presents the findings of completed research, including data analysis and conclusions. It builds upon the proposal by providing the actual results and insights gained from the study.\n\nThe text also mentions the importance of a literature review in understanding the state of research on a topic, identifying gaps, and ensuring the research's value. It advises against using extensive quotes as a substitute for personal analysis and interpretation.\n\nThe context suggests seeking professional help for writing research proposals and literature reviews, highlighting the benefits of expert assistance in conducting research, analyzing sources, and synthesizing information. It emphasizes the need for logical organization and coherence in presenting the literature review.\n\nFinally, the text advises against making a literature review subjective and recommends using bibliographic references as\n\nContext Document 3: Evidence: Counter balancing.

Medicare beneficiaries now have access to acupuncture as a treatment for chronic low back pain. HHS Secretary Alex Azar encourages review of this decision by IDT teams. Acupuncture, also known as Dry Needling, is used for conditions like back pain, muscle pain, and neck tightness. An estimated 1 in 100 Americans suffer from lower back pain. Naturopathic physicians, Oriental Medical Doctors, medical doctors, and nurse practitioners practice acupuncture. However, some guidelines do not endorse passive therapies. Typically, 10-15 needles are inserted into the back for pain treatment. Acupuncture may relieve pain by releasing endorphins. Research from 29 randomized controlled trials involving nearly 18,000 people found acupuncture effective for chronic pain conditions. At follow-up, acupressure patients had less pain and disability than physical therapy patients. Some studies suggest traditional acupuncture is no more effective than \"sham\" acupuncture. Low back pain usually resolves on its own within two months. Medical acupuncture, unlike traditional Chinese acupuncture, uses both traditional and anatomically/neurologically connected points. It results in muscle relaxation, pain modulation, and overall well-being.

Medicare beneficiaries now have access to acupuncture as a treatment for chronic low back pain. HHS Secretary Alex Azar encourages review of this decision by IDT teams. Acupuncture, also known as Dry Needling, is used for conditions like back pain, muscle pain, and neck tightness. An estimated 1 in 100 Americans suffer from lower back pain. Naturopathic physicians, Oriental Medical Doctors, medical doctors, and nurse practitioners practice acupuncture. However, some guidelines do not endorse passive therapies. Typically, 10-15 needles are inserted into the back for pain treatment. Acupuncture may relieve pain by releasing endorphins. Research from 29 randomized controlled trials involving nearly 18,000 people found acupuncture effective for chronic pain conditions. At follow-up, acupressure patients had less pain and disability than physical therapy patients. Some studies suggest traditional acupuncture is no more effective than \"sham\" acupuncture. Low back pain usually resolves on its own within two months. Medical acupuncture, unlike traditional Chinese acupuncture, uses both traditional and anatomically/neurologically connected points. It results in muscle relaxation, pain modulation, and overall well-being. Amy Baird Schlegel's\n\nContext Document 3: Chiropractic services covered by Medicare include only manual manipulation of the spine to correct a subluxation. No other diagnostic or therapeutic services provided by a chiropractor or on their order are covered. Treatment must be medically necessary, and the beneficiary must have a significant neuromusculoskeletal condition. CPT codes 98940-98942 are applicable for spinal regions treated. ICD-9 codes 739.0-739.5 are used for nonallopathic lesions. HCPCS Modifier AT is required for active/corrective treatment of acute or chronic subluxation. There is no set limit on the number of treatments, but frequency depends on the patient's condition. Acupuncture for chronic lower back pain is covered by Medicare. Non-pharmacological therapies, including exercise and psychological programs, are recommended for chronic low back pain management. Chiropractic services are limited under Medicare, and patients may need to seek coverage through other insurance plans.\n\nContext Document 4: Key Information:\n\n1. HCPCS Modifier AT: Required for active/corrective treatment of acute or chronic subluxation by chiropractors.\n2. Maintenance therapy: Excludes HCPCS Modifier AT, results in service denial.\n3.
