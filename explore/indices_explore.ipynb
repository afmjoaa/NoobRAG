      "It sounds like a really bad horror movie, doesn’t it? While this creature has an ordinary brain inside its skull, it also has a second much smaller, but still fully functioning brain squishing around inside its belly. While the skull-brain thinks, and controls the body, and goes about its brainy business, the gut-brain also thinks, and processes information, and exerts control over the body too. It would probably make a pretty cheesy horror movie, but the thing is, it’s true. In fact, that creature with the extra brain is you.\n",
      "We’re talking about what scientists call the enteric nervous system, and all vertebrates have one, including humans. This is a collection of about a hundred million nerve cells that are wrapped around your stomach, esophagus, and intestines. While this second brain is not nearly as complex as the brain in your head, it does have its own motor and sensory neurons, and it uses many of the same brain chemicals and neurotransmitters. It even grows from the same part of the embryo that your other brain grows from.\n",
      "What does this second brain do? Mostly, it coordinates the chemical and muscular activity of digestion, a process that’s actually quite complicated. It also responds to messages from your other brain, especially messages about fear or danger. If you get a stomach ache or diarrhea because of stress or fear, it’s this second brain that coordinates that.\n",

      "Digestive Intelligence: A Holistic View of Your Second Brain\n",
      "by Irina Matveikova\n",
      "Posted by: DailyOM\n",
      "Digestive Intelligence tells the fascinating story of how our digestive systems are the centre of our bodies’ second brain and how we think and live our emotions via our stomachs.\n",
      "Not impossible when you consider there is something equivalent to the size of a village football pitch hiding inside our bellies – that’s the incredible magnitude of our digestive systems. They contain an extensive network of nerve cells, called neurons, which carry information to the brain and thus have a profound effect upon our intellectual, emotional and immune processes.\n",
      "Dr Matveikova answers the obvious questions: “How?” and “Why can this be so?” by explaining, in straight forward layman’s language, that the digestive system contains more than one million neurones, identical to those in the brain and is responsible for producing 90% of the body’s hormone, serotonin, the all-important hormone which makes us feel happy and full of well being. It follows, that if our stomachs are “out of sorts” we can feel irritable, in a bad mood, lacking in energy and those feelings will block our intellectual productivity, tend to disorientate us and completely change our thought patterns and physical processes.\n",
      "Two–Way Emotional Influence\n",
      "Here are some examples of how the upper brain influences our digestion and how our digestive behavior affects our thoughts and moods:\n",
      "• A very tense emotional situation, or a state of terror or a traumatic event may make you vomit, or else provoke diarrhea or cause total indigestion.\n",
      "• When you feel lonely, or frustrated sentimentally, or when your self-esteem has been destroyed, the psychological state you are in can influence your metabolism and the complex processes of digestion. This may cause lack of appetite, disgust, or indifference and a slow and troublesome digestion.More often this “chronic unhappiness” is expressed as a state of anxiety and compulsive behavior, with uncontrollable binge eating at critical moments,usually mid-afternoon and late at night. This compulsive and uncontrolled eating (especially carbohydrates) leads to a rapid release of hormones and chemical substances in both brains, which induce a temporary feeling of well being and overall satisfaction. Shortly afterwards, however, this neuronal mechanism “runs out of steam,” the digestion breaks down and heaviness and bloating develop; the digestive system starts to groan and protest at this food abuse and this is accompanied by a guilty feeling.\n",

      "– by Shelby Leiding\n",
      "On the heels of brain awareness week, we thought it might be fun to take some time to talk about the developing brain, and it what it means for parents, caregivers, and educators to be ‘brain-wise’. With the wealth of research and information that is now available about brain development, it can certainly be overwhelming at times to try and figure out what it means on a day to day basis with your children. With this in mind, we’re going to dive right in and give you a brief run-down of how the brain works and develops, and how this information can help you better connect with your child.\n",
      "To keep things simple, it can be helpful to think of the brain like a 3-story house. The basement level, called the brainstem, is responsible for basic survival functions such as breathing, sleeping, appetite, and fight/flight/freeze to name a few. When a baby is born, this part of the brain is the most developed as it would be impossible to survive without it.\n",
      "The second story, or main level of the house, is called the limbic system. This part of the brain is responsible for some very important functions including memory, attachment, and emotions. This part of the brain is less developed when we are born- which is why few of us have any concrete memories before the age of 2 or 3.\n",
      "The upper story of the house is called the cortex. This part of the brain takes the longest to develop and is responsible for a host of functions including visual and auditory processing, spatial awareness, and movement. This area of the brain usually takes about 3 years to develop, and interruptions to visual, auditory, or kinesthetic stimulation can have lasting ill-effects.\n",
      "Finally, there is an important part of the cortex that deserves some special attention. Located at just behind the forehead, this area is called the pre-frontal cortex and is responsible for rational thought, decision making, speech, creativity, emotional expression and basically everything else that makes humans and primates unique from other species. It’s most important function however is to organize and integrate the entire brain’s activities – in a way it’s kind of like the conductor of an orchestra.\n",
      "Putting it Together\n",
      "Now that you have a basic understanding of the different parts of the brain, we’re going to explore how they develop and what makes children so essentially different from adults.\n",

      "Real brain: our human brain exhibit\n",
      "What is Real Brain?\n",
      "Real Brain is At-Bristol's very special exhibit that displays a real human brain. It forms part of All About Us - our exhibition all about the human body, based around seven themes cardiovascular, senses, reproduction, locomotion, digestion, DNA and brains.\n",
      "The exhibit itself is a large see-through tank, engraved with the outline of a person sitting down on one side, and their skeleton and central nervous system on the other. In the position of the brain will be the real human brain, showing both the right and left hemispheres. The exhibit includes seating on either side.\n",
      "The exhibit also includes a touch screen with videos of people that have a direct interest in medical science research and donor activity. These include two surgeons, a future donor, the Bequests Co-ordinator from the Centre for Clinical and Comparative Anatomy at the University of Bristol and an anatomy teacher.\n",
      "Why does At-Bristol have a human brain exhibit?\n",
      "We have this exhibit to allow our visitors the opportunity to engage in the wonder of the human body, to see ‘real science’ in action through the screen presentation and to gain an appreciation of medical science research.\n",
      "We have given great consideration to how to display the brain so that we provide a safe environment for all our visitors to experience it in terms of viewing it and providing an opportunity for contemplation and reflection.\n",
      "What is the process in producing an exhibit like this?\n",
      "We have worked in close partnership with the Centre for Clinical and Comparative Anatomy at the University of Bristol in the development of this exhibit.\n",
      "We have also consulted with other science centres and visitor attractions (both nationally and internationally) on dealing with difficult science dialogue and contemporary biomedical issues.\n",
      "The process has included assessments by the Human Tissue Authority (HTA) and we hold the necessary Human Tissue Licence. Part of the requirements of the HTA licence are to treat the donor material with the respect and dignity and this has been an important part of our development process.\n",
      "In line with the HTA licence requirements, the donor of the brain gave their full and personal consent to it being presented in At-Bristol as part of the All About Us exhibition with the understanding it will be for the sake of science and learning. At-Bristol holds no personal details of the person who has donated their brain. The brain has come from an anonymous donor.\n",
      "Goery Delacote, Chief Executive Officer of At-Bristol says “There is nothing more interesting than to see something for real.\n",

      "It sounds like a really bad horror movie, doesn’t it? While this creature has an ordinary brain inside its skull, it also has a second much smaller, but still fully functioning brain squishing around inside its belly. While the skull-brain thinks, and controls the body, and goes about its brainy business, the gut-brain also thinks, and processes information, and exerts control over the body too. It would probably make a pretty cheesy horror movie, but the thing is, it’s true. In fact, that creature with the extra brain is you.\n",
      "We’re talking about what scientists call the enteric nervous system, and all vertebrates have one, including humans. This is a collection of about a hundred million nerve cells that are wrapped around your stomach, esophagus, and intestines. While this second brain is not nearly as complex as the brain in your head, it does have its own motor and sensory neurons, and it uses many of the same brain chemicals and neurotransmitters. It even grows from the same part of the embryo that your other brain grows from.\n",
      "What does this second brain do? Mostly, it coordinates the chemical and muscular activity of digestion, a process that’s actually quite complicated. It also responds to messages from your other brain, especially messages about fear or danger. If you get a stomach ache or diarrhea because of stress or fear, it’s this second brain that coordinates that.\n",

As we continued our conversation I shared with her that I had written a total of 1715 articles which can be used as a resource and as a tool to generate discussion in support groups — while honoring my copyright and using my Resource Box.\n",
      "As we continued to talk I again got the impression from the director of this state brain injury association — with whom I was speaking — that there was nothing special about Second Chance to Live. After the phone call ended I processed some of my feelings. Initially I felt minimized, marginalized and some what discounted by what she shared during our conversation. As I examined why I felt those feelings I realized that her opinion was merely her opinion, not reality.\n",
      "After I owned and examined my feelings I remembered that I have experienced similar responses from many of the brain injury associations that I have contacted through out the United States. I am not quite sure why the message of encouragement, motivation, empowerment and hope that is presented through Second Chance to Live is not being utilized by the Brain Injury Association of America or the state brain injury associations.

      "Although the question makes sense, with our current level of technology, and knowledge about how the brain works, it is more or less impossible to give a definitive answer.\n",
      "For example, about 10Mbits of information are transmitted along each optic nerve PER SECOND. But is transmission speed the same thing as processing speed?\n",
      "Research reported on the MIT website indicates that under certain circumstances, one measure of processing speed has registered as few as 60 bits per second. And on the other hand, the researcher has made it plain that he was not testing for the maximum processing speed across a variety of tasks. So we cannot assume that his results were representative of brain processing in general.\n",
      "An estimate on the University of Alberta website suggests that the average \"clock speed\" of neurons in the brain is a mere 200 firings per second - compare that with the clock speed of even a cheap desktop computer in 2010.\n",
      "But that's only part of the story, because the brain of an average healthy human being includes around 100 billion neurons, all connected to something like 1000 (or more) other neurons.\n",
      "100 billion neurons all firing around 200 times per second gives a capacity of 20 million billion firings per second.\n",
      "Having said that, brain scans show only specific areas of the brain operating at a measurable level of activity at an given time. But does that necessarily mean that the other areas are doing nothing?\n",
      "What it may show is that the DEGREE of activity is related to the nature of the task, and therefore will be variable throughout the day (and night).\n",
      "So like I said, the question makes sense. But that doesn't mean we can give a nice neat answer right now.\n",
      "I would make this simple by giving you an idea about what it means brain storage. When you go out on a date with your girlfriend you can remember every single detail that happened that day before , during and after the date.

      "Watching the Reading Brain in Action\n",
      "Imagine that you are shown one word on a computer screen, and that the activity in your brain is recorded over the course of a second. What might you expect to see in your brain? Would you expect just the reading part of the brain to show activation; if so, where would that be? Would you think that different parts of the brain coordinate to read the word? What sequence might different parts of the brain activate? These questions are intended to get you thinking not just about what parts of the brain are relied upon to read a word, but to consider the thinking processes that are integral as well.\n",
      "When cognitive neuroscience researchers put these sorts of questions together, they are able to use cutting-edge neuroimaging technologies to answer them. Using a novel approach to record brain activations (Dale et al., 2000), the “Reading A Word” video was created by Anders Dale and Eric Halgren. The video relies on the combination of two neuroimaging technologies: MRI and MEG. MRI is an excellent tool for determining where in the brain activation occurs. In the same way, MEG is a tool best used to determine when in the brain activation occurs. Taken together, we are able to view the intricacies of the reading brain in action both in terms of time and place, by viewing the results of these technologies combined.\n",
      "Take a look at the video a few times. Once you have taken in the majestic ebb and flow of brain activations in the video, consider how it compared to your ideas of what it takes to read one word as an adult. In a split second, swaths of brain regions are awash in a red and orange hue. (Of course, the brain doesn’t actually light up colorfully, but scientists apply statistical analyses to brain data to create graphical depictions representing the areas with changes in brain activity, which you can’t see otherwise.)\n",

      "I went back to work. I was doing the best that I could do but I would call in, I would leave early, and I had to do that a lot, a lot of the plate hurt so bad that I couldn’t take having to work as fast as they work, and I had to slow things down. I had to slow everything way down from what I was able to do since the first one.\n",
      "Her husband of 14 years further corroborates how much the second injury changed her. He said:\n",
      "The second one probably enhanced what she couldn’t really grasp, made it really hard for her now. It just kind of like multiplied it. Let’s say it was a times 2, now it’s a times 3 or 4, you know, that way.\n",
      "What is perplexing about the total picture of her disability is that most of her deficits are the type of deficits associated with severe brain injury, as we will detail in later Parts of the Elizabeth story. And most of these deficits were clearly there before her second injury. What seemed to have changed because of the concussion was her ability to accommodate the deficits. At the conclusion of the Elizabeth story, I will postulate an explanation for this quandary.\n",

      "Traumatic Brain Injury - Second Impact Syndrome (SIS)\n",
      "A traumatic brain injury can cause multiple symptoms including cognitive problems, memory problems, organization and multitasking problems, confusion, headaches, visual problems, speech problems and other physical manifestations. One of the biggest problems in suffering a traumatic brain injury is the risk of second impact syndrome. Second impact syndrome is when someone suffers a repeat concussion following the first concussion which can cause major complications.\n",
      "The statistics involving traumatic brain injury are staggering. Per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), traumatic brain injury is caused by a bump, blow or jolt to the head or a penetrating head injury that disrupts the normal function of the brain. It is not necessary to have a loss of consciousness to suffer a traumatic brain injury. Each year at least 1.7 million traumatic brain injuries occur either as an isolated injury or along with other injuries. This frequency of traumatic brain injuries makes it extremely easy to suffer a second impact syndrome which is a second traumatic brain injury or concussion over and above the first.\n",
      "Second impact syndrome (SIS) is a condition in which the brain swells rapidly and catastrophically after a person suffers a second concussion or traumatic brain injury before the symptoms from the earlier one have subsided. The results can be devastating, permanent and even fatal. Studies show that the brain is more vulnerable to a second concussive injury administered shortly after the first prior to recovering from the first traumatic brain injury.\n",
      "Studies also show that people who have received one concussion are at a higher risk to receive a concussion in the future. Evidence exists indicating that people who have had multiple concussive brain injuries over the course of their lives may acquire lasting, and even progressive, cognitive impairment that limits functional ability. Multiple or repeat traumatic brain injuries are extremely dangerous, but a second traumatic brain injury before the symptoms of the first traumatic brain injury have subsided can cause second impact syndrome, brain swelling and catastrophic results.\n",
      "Second impact syndrome is obvious in sports and society is more aware of the catastrophic results of traumatic brain injury and sports concussions and are at the forefront of health concerns. However, everyone suffering a traumatic brain injury is at risk for a repeat traumatic brain injury and for second impact syndrome.\n",

Our concussion therapy office can significantly help with all of the aforementioned components.\n",

      "When athletes return to the field before their brain and body has healed from the first concussion, another injury to the head could result in second impact syndrome also known as brain swelling, which is often fatal. Concussion recovery is different for each individual, as brain chemicals become imbalanced requiring stabilization before returning to play. This is why athletes must be evaluated and treated at ProNeuro Health. Athletes should not begin playing again if concussion symptoms are still present.\n",
