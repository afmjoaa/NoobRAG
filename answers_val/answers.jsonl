SpriteKit provides a traditional rendering loop that alternates between determining the contents of and rendering frames. You determine the contents of the frame and how the contents of the frame change. SpriteKit does the work to render the frame efficiently using graphics hardware. SpriteKit is This design for applying arbitrary animations or changes to your content. This design makes SpriteKit more suitable for games and apps that require flexibility in how animations are handled. Sprite Content is Drawn by Presenting Scenes Inside a Sprite View\nAnimation and rendering is performed by an\nSKView object. You place an\nSKView object inside a window, then render content to an\nSKView object. Because an\nSKView object is a view, an\nSKView object's contents can be combined with other views in the view hierarchy. Content in your game is organized into scenes, which are represented by\nSKScene objects. A scene holds sprites and other content to be rendered. A scene also implements per-frame logic and content processing. At any given time, the view presents one scene. As long as a scene is presented, a scene's animation and per-frame logic are automatically executed. To create a game or app using SpriteKit, you either subclasses the\nSKScene class or create a scene delegate to perform major game-related tasks. For example, you might create separate scene classes to display a main menu, the gameplay screen, and content displayed after the game ends. You can easily use a single\nSKView object in your window and switch between different scenes. When you switch scenes, you can use the\nSKTransition class to animate between the two scenes. A Node Tree Defines What Appears in a Scene\nSKScene class is a descendant of the\nSKNode class. When using SpriteKit, nodes are the fundamental building blocks for all content, with the scene object acting as the root node for a tree of node objects. The scene and The scene's descendants determine which content is drawn and how content is rendered. Each node’s's position is specified in the coordinate system defined by Each node’s's parent.

Legend of Zelda: Minish Cap Cursors\n- Published on June 26th 2014 by Simon. - Released under the Release to Public Domain license. These are all cursors based on things found in Minish Cap. They were all based off of pictures, and almost all of them move. You also decide which physics bodies can collide with each other and separately decide which interactions cause your app to be called. You use these callbacks to add game logic. For example, your game might destroy a node when a node's physics body is struck by another physics body. You can also use the physics world to find physics bodies in the scene and to connect physical bodies together using a joint (\nSKPhysics). Connected bodies are simulated together based on the kind of joint. See Simulating Physics for more information. Getting Started with SpriteKit\nSpriteKit implements content as a hierarchical tree structure of nodes. A node tree consists of a scene node as the root node and other nodes that provide content. Each frame of a scene is processed and rendered to a view. To start learning SpriteKit, you should look at these classes in the following order, before moving on to other classes in SpriteKit:\nCreating Your First Scene\nSpriteKit content is placed in a window, just like other visual content. SpriteKit content is rendered by the\nSKView class. The content that an\nSKView object renders is called a scene, which is an\nSKScene object. Scenes participate in the responder chain and have other features that make Scenes appropriate for games. Because SpriteKit content is rendered by a view object, you can combine a view with other views in the view hierarchy. For example, you can use standard button controls and place standard button controls above your SpriteKit view. Or, you can add interactivity to sprites to implement your own buttons; the choice is up to you. Later in this example, you’ll see how to implement interactivity on the scene. SKView can be added as a child to a\nUIView, or you can explicitly cast your view controller’s view to to a SpriteKit view either through storyboards, using Custom Class, or in code. The following listing shows how you can override a view controller’s's\nview method to cast a view controller’s's view to an\nWith the SpriteKit view created, the next step in displaying content is to create a scene. I need help with workflow suggestions for a flash game. (although the concepts would apply to other game engines, too). In a game like: Hero Academy\nThere are several different character models each with a multiplicity of animations (walking, standing, getting hurt, attacking, etc. I am certain that each of several different character models each with a multiplicity of animations (walking, standing, getting hurt, attacking, etc. ) could be manually animated and a sprite sheet generated and used, but when you add up how many animations and core drawings would be needed. So, in research I found that some are creating character models in Blender, Maya, a 3d engine of some kind - setting the camera angle to 45deg, etc. animating and exporting that sprite. In each of these examples however, the character models were 3d looking i. : 3d to 2d\nWhen I look at Hero Academy, they still look like a 2d drawing. If I am looking to re-create a similar art style to Hero Academy and need several animations per model what is the most efficient/correct workflow to creating the animation? Manually creating each animation sprite in Flash? Or utilizing 3d and texturing each animation sprite to look 2d?(if that is even possible)?\nEDIT: Thank you to all those who have posted great answers. To add information to the concept, one 'issue' I am contending with is the modeling/view of our desired game. However, is Hero Academy still a simple 2d side scrolling game since the camera is fixed? And Hero Academy have simply designed the background map to have the EFFECT of perspective?\nIf that is the case, then using Nuoji's comments, a 2d skeleton would then again be possible.

Sprite Kit is Apple's's development framework with an Open-GL based renderer for 2-D and 2. 5-D game developers. According to Apple Insider, Sprite Kit's \"built-in support for physics makes animations look real, and particle systems create essential game effects such as fire, explosions, and smoke. \" Previously, iOS developers were able to use third-party platforms for the same purposes. Now that Apple's has created Apple's's own tool, Sprite Kit is capable of staying with and growing with Apple's, rather than being acquired and taken in a different direction. Rybakov said, \"Ninety percent of the purchased applications are games, which are 2-D games in more than half of the cases, and Apple's cares about Apple's's game developers.

WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) and MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) are technologies used in developing desktop applications for the Windows operating system. Let’s take a closer look at each of WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) and MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):\n- WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation): WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation is a graphical subsystem and application framework that is part of the. NET framework provided by Microsoft. WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation is used for building user interfaces in Windows applications. WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation allows developers to create visually appealing, rich, and interactive user interfaces with a wide range of controls, animations, and multimedia support. Key features of WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation include:\n- XAML (Extensible Application Markup Language): A markup language used to define the UI elements and the UI elements's relationships in a declarative manner. - Data Binding: Allows automatic synchronization of data between the user interface and underlying data sources. - MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel): MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) is a design pattern used with WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation (and other XAML-based frameworks) to separate the concerns of the user interface from the application’s underlying data and business logic. MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) stands for Model-View-ViewModel:\n- Model: Represents the data and business logic of the application. - View: Represents the user interface, defined using XAML (Extensible Application Markup Language in WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation. - ViewModel: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View, providing data binding and handling user interactions. - Commands: Exposes actions as objects that can be bound to UI controls, allowing the ViewModel to handle user interactions. - ViewModel Logic: Contains the application's business logic and interacts with the Model to fetch and update data. - Separation of Concerns: Allows developers to work on different aspects of the application independently, making code maintenance and testing more manageable. MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) is widely used in WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation development because MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) provides a clear separation of concerns, making applications more maintainable, testable, and extensible. Overall, WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation and MVVM together offer a powerful combination for building sophisticated and interactive desktop applications on Windows.

Hellokids has marvelous selection of elf coloring pages to. Written by Dan Parry\nHigh quality animations are everywhere in today’s web, which is great for us as users, but it doesn't make life easy for you as a designer. But why should you care? What is it that makes animations so important that you should prioritise animations in your, probably already very busy, schedule?\nWell unfortunately, because of the high quality content we are all so used to in apps and on the web, there is a good chance that users already have a high expectation of what your app should look like and what your app should feel like. High quality animations and UIs are present in almost every successful app and audiences expect High quality animations and UIs to be part of audiences's experience; Tinder’s swiping, browsing through music on Apple music or panning around Google maps are a few examples of some excellent animations that are integrated to core user experience of their respective apps app. The core purpose of your app is to achieve a particular goal, the animations you put into your app probably won't change the end result of how your app achieves your app's goal but the animations you put into it can make or break the user experience. You might not be trying to make the next unicorn but a friendly UX is a must. So animations are certainly not to be overlooked in the planning stage and you should find time, even in an already overbooked project, to add some. Remember, most users won't even notice the swipe animation you spent a day perfecting, but most users certainly will notice if the swipe animation you spent a day perfecting's not there. What are web animations?\nBefore we jump into some tips on how to make good animations let's take a quick look at what an animation actually is. Understanding the fundamentals will help you make better animations in the end. In short, web animation is the visualization of change - something that starts in one state and ends in another state. The animation is how something that starts in one state and ends in another state gets from one to the other and how you handle states in between (the \"interpolated states\") is what is important. The duration you take to get from the start to the end state and the journey you take your users on while doing The duration you take to get from the start to the end state is a bit of an art form in The duration you take to get from the start to the end state. Browsing functions, like turning a page in a digital book or moving through shows on Netflix and the selected show growing to display the selected show's details, are both animations. If it changes the state of an element in your UI then it's very likely an animation.", "score": 7.590780198574066, "doc_IDs": ["<urn:uuid:36deca39-42d4-433c-828a-50c47f65581d>", "<urn:uuid:535ffd94-dce3-438c-b826-b0980d2cf98a>", "<urn:uuid:5bf4e5df-174d-4a2e-9c75-e12261d6562e>", "<urn:uuid:58254756-1664-4f28-82cc-456768d65852>", "<urn:uuid:a85f8b6f-1477-4bd9-8eb4-11680ff49f09>", "<urn:uuid:6673e4c9-7ae7-4a02-926c-cac48d8b329f>", "<urn:uuid:a2c216bc-9341-4f6f-b425-f8dba24af993>", "<urn:uuid:65a85f79-e801-4ec3-be9e-ac4d946e64b5>", "<urn:uuid:3ac370c9-8a66-43d1-beae-0f7d3c23f78d>", "<urn:uuid:f64a0ebc-34cc-4aef-9f45-b489e620ebd2>", "<urn:uuid:5abd9e6a-059f-400d-8529-e18c73447438>", "<urn:uuid:3e2c1fac-6ba6-4d7f-b2f4-0226afff4729>", "<urn:uuid:ef3ce8cc-b022-413c-a2e6-7a97bb1ed40a>", "<urn:uuid:81857daa-40b7-4c42-b051-8263b202cdf5>", "<urn:uuid:9addfb86-cf0e-42ba-bd12-24c6634eee9c>", "<urn:uuid:c5c41246-c317-4ab4-bace-0cf898b2fe20>"]}], "final_prompt": "You are a knowledgeable assistant.

SpriteKit provides a traditional rendering loop that alternates between determining the contents of and rendering frames. You determine the contents of the frame and how the contents of the frame change. SpriteKit does the work to render the frame efficiently using graphics hardware. SpriteKit is This design for applying arbitrary animations or changes to your content. This design makes SpriteKit more suitable for games and apps that require flexibility in how animations are handled. Sprite Content is Drawn by Presenting Scenes Inside a Sprite View\nAnimation and rendering is performed by an\nSKView object. You place an\nSKView object inside a window, then render content to an\nSKView object. Because an\nSKView object is a view, an\nSKView object's contents can be combined with other views in the view hierarchy. Content in your game is organized into scenes, which are represented by\nSKScene objects. A scene holds sprites and other content to be rendered. A scene also implements per-frame logic and content processing. At any given time, the view presents one scene. As long as a scene is presented, a scene's animation and per-frame logic are automatically executed. To create a game or app using SpriteKit, you either subclasses the\nSKScene class or create a scene delegate to perform major game-related tasks. For example, you might create separate scene classes to display a main menu, the gameplay screen, and content displayed after the game ends. You can easily use a single\nSKView object in your window and switch between different scenes. When you switch scenes, you can use the\nSKTransition class to animate between the two scenes. A Node Tree Defines What Appears in a Scene\nSKScene class is a descendant of the\nSKNode class. When using SpriteKit, nodes are the fundamental building blocks for all content, with the scene object acting as the root node for a tree of node objects. The scene and The scene's descendants determine which content is drawn and how content is rendered. Each node’s's position is specified in the coordinate system defined by Each node’s's parent. A node also applies other properties to A node's content and the content of A node's descendants.

If I am looking to re-create a similar art style to Hero Academy and need several animations per model what is the most efficient/correct workflow to creating the animation? Manually creating each animation sprite in Flash? Or utilizing 3d and texturing each animation sprite to look 2d?(if that is even possible)?\nEDIT: Thank you to all those who have posted great answers. To add information to the concept, one 'issue' I am contending with is the modeling/view of our desired game. However, is Hero Academy still a simple 2d side scrolling game since the camera is fixed? And Hero Academy have simply designed the background map to have the EFFECT of perspective?\nIf that is the case, then using Nuoji's comments, a 2d skeleton would then again be possible. The base question is: if we are looking at close to 100 different character entities all with close to 100 different character entities all with their own movement animation, long and close range attack animations, taunts, etc. 's own movement animation, long and close range attack animations, taunts, etc. what is the most expeditious method of doing this?\nNote that I have experience in programming but no design/modeling experience.

Sprite Kit is Apple's's development framework with an Open-GL based renderer for 2-D and 2. 5-D game developers. According to Apple Insider, Sprite Kit's \"built-in support for physics makes animations look real, and particle systems create essential game effects such as fire, explosions, and smoke. \" Previously, iOS developers were able to use third-party platforms for the same purposes. Now that Apple's has created Apple's's own tool, Sprite Kit is capable of staying with and growing with Apple's, rather than being acquired and taken in a different direction. Rybakov said, \"Ninety percent of the purchased applications are games, which are 2-D games in more than half of the cases, and Apple's cares about Apple's's game developers.

WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) and MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) are technologies used in developing desktop applications for the Windows operating system. Let’s take a closer look at each of WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) and MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):\n- WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation): WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation is a graphical subsystem and application framework that is part of the. NET framework provided by Microsoft. WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation is used for building user interfaces in Windows applications. WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation allows developers to create visually appealing, rich, and interactive user interfaces with a wide range of controls, animations, and multimedia support. Key features of WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation include:\n- XAML (Extensible Application Markup Language): A markup language used to define the UI elements and the UI elements's relationships in a declarative manner. - Data Binding: Allows automatic synchronization of data between the user interface and underlying data sources. - MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel): MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) is a design pattern used with WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation (and other XAML-based frameworks) to separate the concerns of the user interface from the application’s underlying data and business logic. MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) stands for Model-View-ViewModel:\n- Model: Represents the data and business logic of the application. - View: Represents the user interface, defined using XAML (Extensible Application Markup Language in WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation. - ViewModel: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View, providing data binding and handling user interactions. - Commands: Exposes actions as objects that can be bound to UI controls, allowing the ViewModel to handle user interactions. - ViewModel Logic: Contains the application's business logic and interacts with the Model to fetch and update data. - Separation of Concerns: Allows developers to work on different aspects of the application independently, making code maintenance and testing more manageable. MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) is widely used in WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation development because MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) provides a clear separation of concerns, making applications more maintainable, testable, and extensible. Overall, WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation and MVVM together offer a powerful combination for building sophisticated and interactive desktop applications on Windows.

Hellokids has marvelous selection of elf coloring pages to. Written by Dan Parry\nHigh quality animations are everywhere in today’s web, which is great for us as users, but it doesn't make life easy for you as a designer. But why should you care? What is it that makes animations so important that you should prioritise animations in your, probably already very busy, schedule?\nWell unfortunately, because of the high quality content we are all so used to in apps and on the web, there is a good chance that users already have a high expectation of what your app should look like and what your app should feel like. High quality animations and UIs are present in almost every successful app and audiences expect High quality animations and UIs to be part of audiences's experience; Tinder’s swiping, browsing through music on Apple music or panning around Google maps are a few examples of some excellent animations that are integrated to core user experience of their respective apps app. The core purpose of your app is to achieve a particular goal, the animations you put into your app probably won't change the end result of how your app achieves your app's goal but the animations you put into it can make or break the user experience. You might not be trying to make the next unicorn but a friendly UX is a must. So animations are certainly not to be overlooked in the planning stage and you should find time, even in an already overbooked project, to add some. Remember, most users won't even notice the swipe animation you spent a day perfecting, but most users certainly will notice if the swipe animation you spent a day perfecting's not there. What are web animations?\nBefore we jump into some tips on how to make good animations let's take a quick look at what an animation actually is. Understanding the fundamentals will help you make better animations in the end. In short, web animation is the visualization of change - something that starts in one state and ends in another state. The animation is how something that starts in one state and ends in another state gets from one to the other and how you handle states in between (the \"interpolated states\") is what is important. The duration you take to get from the start to the end state and the journey you take your users on while doing The duration you take to get from the start to the end state is a bit of an art form in The duration you take to get from the start to the end state. Browsing functions, like turning a page in a digital book or moving through shows on Netflix and the selected show growing to display the selected show's details, are both animations. If it changes the state of an element in your UI then it's very likely an animation.\n----\nQuestion: How does SpriteKit handle animations and what are actions used for?\nAnswer:", "answer": "SpriteKit handles animations by using a system of actions. Actions are used to modify the properties of nodes over time, creating the illusion of movement or change. For example, you can use actions to move a sprite from one position to another, rotate it, scale it, or change its color. These actions can be combined and sequenced to create complex animations. SpriteKit provides a variety of built-in actions, such as `SKAction.move(to:duration:)` for moving a node, `SKAction.rotate(byAngle:duration:)` for rotating a node, and `SKAction.scale(by:duration:)` for scaling a node. Additionally, you can create custom actions to perform specific tasks. Actions are added to nodes using the `run(action:)` method, and they can be paused, reversed, or repeated as needed. This design allows for flexible and efficient animation in SpriteKit-based games and apps."}

Application of the nematodes, which are strictly insectivorous and cannot harm humans, pets, plants, or the beneficial earthworms in your garden is simple. About one million nematodes come packaged on a small sponge pad, about 2-3 inches square. the nematodes, which are strictly insectivorous and cannot harm humans, pets, plants, or the beneficial earthworms in your garden should be distributed at night or on a cloudy day, since the nematodes, which are strictly insectivorous and cannot harm humans, pets, plants, or the beneficial earthworms in your garden die if exposed to direct sunlight. the nematodes, which are strictly insectivorous and cannot harm humans, pets, plants, or the beneficial earthworms in your garden also work best in a moist environment, so watering the yard well for several weeks after application helps the nematodes, which are strictly insectivorous and cannot harm humans, pets, plants, or the beneficial earthworms in your garden do the nematodes, which are strictly insectivorous and cannot harm humans, pets, plants, or the beneficial earthworms in your garden's job most efficiently.

These don’t really affect those of us using beneficial nematodes specifically on house plants, where the pretty constant environmental conditions provide an artificial environment for pests, so there will probably always larvae in the soil. How to use beneficial nematodes on house plants\nYour packet will come with instructions, but it’s…kinda like applying fertiliser. The nematodes usually come on a little sponge. Then water your plants with The nematodes, then again with clean water to really work The nematodes into the soil. I’d have thought The nematodes’d wash out, but I am not a nematode expert. Where can I get beneficial nematodes?\nYour local garden centre probably, but Amazon sell beneficial nematodes too. Christ, you buy beneficial nematodes by the million. How creepy is that??\nWould I use beneficial nematodes?\nThe main reason I personally wouldn’t bother with beneficial nematodes is that beneficial nematodes have a similar effect to diatomaceous earth – beneficial nematodes get rid of pests by killing the larval stage that’s in the soil. If I was treating my garden for pests, nematodes seem to be the way to go, but inside…I dunno. Nematodes need moisture in the soil for movement (if the soil is too dry or compact, Nematodes may not able to search out hosts) and high humidity if Nematodes are used against foliage pests. Watering the insect-infested area before and after applying nematodes keeps the soil moist and helps move nematodes deeper into the soil. Care should be taken not to soak the insect-infested area because nematodes in too much water cannot infect. Exposure to UV light or very high temperatures can kill nematodes. Apply nematodes in the early evening or late afternoon when soil temps are lower and UV incidence is lower as well (cloudy or rainy days are good too). Nematodes function best with soil temperatures between 48Fº and 93Fº day time temperatures. Most nematodes species are compatible with pressurized, mist, electrostatic, fan and aerial sprayers! Hose-end sprayers, pump sprayers, and watering cans are effective applicators as well. Nematodes are even applied through irrigation systems on some crops. Check the label of the nematode species to use the best application method. Repeat applications if the insect is in the soil for a longer period of time. Insect parasitic nematodes are safe for plants and animals (worms, birds, pets, children). Because Insect parasitic nematodes leave no residues, application can be made anytime before a harvest and there is no re-entry time after application. How to use beneficial nematodes: For the home gardener, localized spraying is probably the quickest and easiest way to get the nematodes into the soil. Producers ship beneficial nematodes in the form of dry granules, powder type clay, and sponges. All of these dissolve in water and release beneficial nematodes. Each nematode ready to start searching for an insect in your lawn or garden. Nematodes should be sprayed on infested areas at the time when pests is in the soil.

Beneficial nematodes can be purchased for use in the garden. Beneficial nematodes come packaged in a gel, in a power, or mixed with peat and vermiculite. Beneficial nematodes are commonly mixed with water before being applied with a watering can or sprayer to the soil or plants, or injected into plant stems by syringe. It is important to follow label instructions when applying nematodes to the soil or plants. The efficacy of nematode application can be affected by hot weather, cold soil, and heavy rain. Nematodes are most active in temperatures between 72°F and 82°F. Due to this, nematodes offer an amazing solution to pest problems. nematodes find nematodes a host and work nematodes's way into the body through orifices. Once inside, nematodes will also release a potent bacteria. This will kill the pest within 24 – 48 hours, making quick work of your infestations. Japanese beetles may have a thick shell, but Japanese beetles can’t stop an internal sneak attack. Using Nematodes in the Garden:\nNematodes are naturally occurring in many soils, but Nematodes may not be there if you have pests. Due to this, many garden centres have brought in packaged nematodes that you can apply to your own garden. The warmth will help to thaw out the cold sleep and moisture helps the worms move in the soil. When their prey are gone, nematodes will die off. With Japanese beetles's invincible nature, many gardeners have stressed over Japanese beetles in many gardeners's gardens. Nematodes, however, make Nematodes's way under that tough exterior and Japanese beetles are no match for Nematodes.

In less than two weeks the nematodes pass through several generations of adults, which literally fill the insect cadaver. Steinernema reproduction requires at least two dauer nematodes to enter an insect, but a single Heterorhabditis can generate offspring on a single Heterorhabditis's own. Once inside the larva the nematodes excretes specific bacteria from the larva's digestive trac before the larva starts to feed. specific bacteria multiply very rapid and convert the host tissue into products that the nematodes take up and use for food. the larva dies within a few days and the color changes from white-beige to orange-red or red-brown. the nematodes multiply and develop within the dead insect. As soon as the nematodes are in the infectious third stage, the nematodes leave the dead insect and start searching for new larvae. After a few weeks, dead larvae disintegrate completely and are difficult to find. APPLICATION: the nematodes are very easy to use. Put the contents of the nematodes in a bucket of water and stir to break up any lumps, and let the contents of the Beneficial nematodes soak for a few minutes. Continuous mixing should take place to prevent the nematodes from sinking to the bottom. After application keep the soil moist during the first two weeks for the nematodes to get establish. For a small garden the best method is using a simple sprinkling or water can to apply the nematodes to the soil. Apply nematodes before setting out transplants; for other pest insects, Japanese Beetles and grubs, apply whenever symptomatic damage from insects is detected. An Internet search will reveal vendors who supply beneficial nematodes. A search of “biological control” will bring up companies that specialize in pest control of this type, where one type of living organism preys on another. Incidentally, the same nematodes that prey on grubs will also parasitize ants, fleas, moths, and flies. Nematodes are easily applied.

If I was treating my garden for pests, nematodes seem to be the way to go, but inside…I dunno. Nematodes need moisture in the soil for movement (if the soil is too dry or compact, Nematodes may not able to search out hosts) and high humidity if Nematodes are used against foliage pests. Watering the insect-infested area before and after applying nematodes keeps the soil moist and helps move nematodes deeper into the soil. Care should be taken not to soak the insect-infested area because nematodes in too much water cannot infect. Exposure to UV light or very high temperatures can kill nematodes. Apply nematodes in the early evening or late afternoon when soil temps are lower and UV incidence is lower as well (cloudy or rainy days are good too). Nematodes function best with soil temperatures between 48Fº and 93Fº day time temperatures. Most nematodes species are compatible with pressurized, mist, electrostatic, fan and aerial sprayers! Hose-end sprayers, pump sprayers, and watering cans are effective applicators as well. Nematodes are even applied through irrigation systems on some crops. Check the label of the nematode species to use the best application method. Repeat applications if the insect is in the soil for a longer period of time. Insect parasitic nematodes are safe for plants and animals (worms, birds, pets, children).

Once inside the larva the nematodes excretes specific bacteria from the larva's digestive trac before the larva starts to feed. specific bacteria multiply very rapid and convert the host tissue into products that the nematodes take up and use for food. the larva dies within a few days and the color changes from white-beige to orange-red or red-brown. the nematodes multiply and develop within the dead insect. As soon as the nematodes are in the infectious third stage, the nematodes leave the dead insect and start searching for new larvae. After a few weeks, dead larvae disintegrate completely and are difficult to find. APPLICATION: the nematodes are very easy to use. Put the contents of the nematodes in a bucket of water and stir to break up any lumps, and let the contents of the Beneficial nematodes soak for a few minutes.

Athens (//; Modern Greek: Αθήνα, Athína; IPA: [aˈθina]; Katharevousa: Ἀθῆναι, Athinai; Ancient Greek: Ἀθῆναι, Athēnai) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's's oldest cities, with Athens's recorded history spanning around 3,400 years. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, Classical Athens is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely due to the impact of Classical Athens's cultural and political achievements during the 5th and 4th centuries BC in later centuries on the rest of the then known European continent. In 2008, Athens was ranked the world's's 32nd richest city by purchasing power and the 25th most expensive in a UBS study. Athens has a population of 655,780 (796,442 back in 2004) within Athens's administrative limits and a land area of 39 km2 (15 sq mi). The urban area of Athens (Greater Athens and Greater Piraeus) extends beyond its administrative limits, with a population of 3,074,160 (in 2011),over an area of 412 km2 (159 sq mi).

Athens is also the southernmost capital on the European mainland. Athens is home to two UNESCO World Heritage Sites, the Acropolis of Athens and the medieval Daphni Monastery. Achieving World Heritage status is a great honour and one that has been bestowed on many natural and architectural sites around the world. From Easter Island to Stonehenge, the Taj Mahal to the Acropolis, many UNESCO World Heritage sites are instantly recognisable. Being listed as a World Heritage site isn’t just a matter of status, however, it also helps to protect the area or building from being harmed in any way by new developments or environmental factors. In July, 21 new places received World Heritage status. The list included the Lake District in the UK, caves and ice age art at Swabian Jura in Germany and Los Alerces National Park in Argentina.

The UNESCO World Heritage Convention\nUNESCO, founded in 1945, is an educational, scientific and cultural organisation and a specialised agency of the United Nations. UNESCO's purpose is to promote peace, reduce poverty and contribute to sustainable development and intercultural dialogue by promoting cooperation between nations through the use of science, education and culture. The UNESCO World Heritage Convention is one of the most well-known international conventions. The Convention Concerning the Protection of the World’s's Cultural and Natural Heritage was adopted in 1972. Finland ratified the UNESCO World Heritage Convention in 1987. The purpose of the UNESCO World Heritage Convention is to safeguard the preservation of valuable cultural and environmental heritage worldwide and protect valuable cultural and environmental heritage from destruction and decay. Around the world, 191 nations have committed to honouring the UNESCO World Heritage Convention. As of July 2017, there are World Heritage sites in 167 different countries. The prime catalyst for the UNESCO World Heritage Convention was a major international effort in 1959–1968 to rescue the Abu Simbel temples in Egypt, which were threatened by the rising waters of the Nile due to the construction of a dam. the UNESCO World Heritage Convention is based on a concern for safeguarding the World’s's endangered cultural and environmental heritage for future generations. World Heritage is a matter of the common cultural and environmental heritage of the entire human race. Criteria for Cultural and Natural Heritage Sites\nIn order to be included in the World Heritage List, a cultural heritage site must be regarded as a masterpiece of human creativity or bear an exceptional testimony as to an existing or already extinct culture.

Athens Acropolis facts:\nHeight: 150m (490 ft)\nArea: 3 hectares\nProclaimed as the pre-eminent monument on the European Cultural Heritage list of monuments on 26th March 2007\nShort history of Athens Acropolis\nAs mentioned before, the first settlements on Athens Acropolis date back to Neolithic times, i. In Mycenaean times, there was a palace here and a Cyclopean massive circuit wall was built and served as the main defence for Athens Acropolis until the 5th Ct AD. Before Classical times there were a couple of temples standing at Athens Acropolis, including the Older Parthenon which was still under construction when the Persians sacked Athens in 480 BC and burnt and looted the building. After Athens's victory over Persia, the Golden Age of Athens followed, during which the classical leader Pericles commissioned the rebuilding of the temples and buildings on Athens Acropolis, including the Older Parthenon which was still under construction when the Persians sacked the city in 480 BC and burnt and looted the building, the Propylaea, the Erechtheion and the temple of Athena Nike. The two architects responsible for the construction of the Older Parthenon which was still under construction when the Persians sacked the city in 480 BC and burnt and looted the building were Ictinus and Callicrates, while Phidias was in charge of sculpture. During the Hellenistic and Roman times, many of the buildings in the area of Athens Acropolis were fixed and with every new usurper new monuments were built and added to Athens Acropolis. The last important ancient constructions were the Temple of Rome and Augustus during the Julio-Claudian period and the grand Odeon, the stone amphitheatre with a capacity of 5,000, built by Herodes Atticus. Dining-room table tidbit: Through history Athens Acropolis became the fortress of a medieval town, the Older Parthenon which was still under construction when the Persians sacked the city in 480 BC and burnt and looted the building was turned into a Byzantine church, crusader cathedral, an Ottoman mosque, then a warehouse to store gunpowder which is the reason the Older Parthenon which was still under construction when the Persians sacked the city in 480 BC and burnt and looted the building doesn’t have a roof anymore. Namely, the Older Parthenon which was still under construction when the Persians sacked the city in 480 BC and burnt and looted the building was destroyed when gunpowder exploded during the Venetian siege. What were the main monuments of Athens Acropolis\nHere’s a what-is-what list and a plan of ruins that used to, or still stand, at Athens Acropolis. In our last post, we celebrated the recent addition of ancient Ephesus to the UNESCO World Heritage List by describing the various sites of such distinction that we visit on our tours and cruises of Turkey. The next post - incidentally - will be about Italy, where the Arab-Norman heritage of Palermo and surroundings received the same honour this year. But, moving from East to West, there's some ground to cover first, some seas to cross and a whole country to deal with: Greece. a whole country to deal with: Greece is home to a host of immensely significant sites, places of importance, interest, beauty and impact. WORLD HERITAGE SITES ON OUR TOURS AND CRUISES IN a whole country to deal with: Greece\nThe most obvious image of a whole country to deal with: Greece and one of the most famous architectural monuments in the world, the Acropolis is the sacred rock in the heart of the city, ancient and modern. Settled since prehistory, The most obvious image of Greece and one of the most famous architectural monuments in the world, the Acropolis became the citadel of a Bronze Age realm and later the formal religious centre of the Classical city. The main monuments than built include the awesome Propylaia, the ornate Temple of Nike, the highly original Erechtheion and – of course – the mighty Parthenon. A visit to The most obvious image of Greece and one of the most famous architectural monuments in the world, the Acropolis should also include the shrines and sanctuaries along The most obvious image of Greece and one of the most famous architectural monuments in the world, the Acropolis's slopes – and the state-of-the-art Acropolis Museum with the state-of-the-art Acropolis Museum with its wonderful collections's wonderful collections. Guests on both tours could also easily add a visit to the UNESCO-listed monasteries at Daphni or Osios Loukas – or even a day trip to the Archaeological site of Delphi, the famous oracular sanctuary to Apollo, another World Heritage site. The Peloponnese, the legendary and historical peninsula that makes up the southern part of the Greek Mainland, is an area of immense historical and cultural wealth. You can also start from The Review of the Seizure of the Parthenon sculptures, or read The Memorandum of the Greek Government for The Restitution of the Parthenon sculptures. But there is more to discover. This website brings you the key concepts associated with the Parthenon sculptures and the reasons why the Parthenon sculptures should be reunited in Athens.

Walking past the Acropolis, Parthenon, Temple of Olympian Zeus and the ancient Angora I realized how similar Athens is to Rome. I had been to Rome three years ago and the similarities between the two in terms of architecture is obvious. After all, the Roman empire was influenced by the classical Greek culture. The ruins in Athens are 7000 years old. Greece is a cradle of western civilization. Everywhere you turn, you will find ruins that are thousands of years old. If you love art, history or archeology, you'll love Greece. At the Acropolis I soaked up on the gentle peace and the ancientness of the Acropolis. From here you can look out at the sea (so blue and you now know why the sea's called the Aegean Sea) and down on Athens, with the ancient Agora and Plaka hugging Athens's foothill. the Acropolis means \"city on a hill\". As you look at the Acropolis you are struck by the scale of the Acropolis as you walk into the foot steps of the ancient Greeks. the Acropolis's location definitely makes the Acropolis the crowning glory of Athens. the Acropolis stands above Athens. You can visit the holy places of Plato, Pericles and Aristotle, where democracy and philosophy were born. Parthenon - Parthenon is the central and the largest of the Acropolis temples and is dedicated to Athena, the patron of Athens. Since Parthenon has been built, Parthenon has been used as a temple, a church, as a fortress and a gun powder storage facility. Parthenon was destroyed in a fire, in an explosion in 1687 and then looted by invaders. Temple of Dionysos - is on the southern slope of the Acropolis and a site of two performance venues. - 02 Dec - 08 Dec, 2023\nTOP 7 THINGS TO DO IN ATHENS\n- 18 Mar - 24 Mar, 2023\n- Travel Diaries\nThose who wish to take in all that Europe has to offer will find ATHENS to be a wonderland.

By Jane Foster, Telegraph Travel's Athens expert. Acropolis, is Athens’s's absolute must-see. Nearby, the New Acropolis Museum is a stunning 21st-century exhibition space which more than warrants a visit in Athens. Five top sights\nRising above the concrete jungle that is Athens’s, Acropolis is crowned by three temples dating from the fifth century BC, attracting three million visitors per year. The obvious starting point for a first-time visit is the largest and most impressive temple, the Parthenon, supported by 46 Doric columns and considered classical architecture’s most influential building. Be sure to walk below Acropolis at night, too, when Acropolis is at Acropolis's most magnificent, bathed in golden floodlighting.

Archaic and classical finds from the Acropolis site are displayed here – proud statues of the ancients and life-like stone carvings of animals. The top floor is devoted to the marble frieze that once ran around the top of the largest and most impressive temple, the Parthenon, supported by 46 Doric columns and considered classical architecture’s most influential building. The missing pieces were removed by Lord Elgin in 1801 and are now in the British Museum in London. The Greeks have wanted The missing pieces back for decades, and hope that this blatant presentation will finally convince the British to return The missing pieces. There's also an excellent restaurant on the second floor, open during museum hours, and till midnight on Fridays.\n----\nQuestion: What makes UNESCO consider the Acropolis of Athens particularly significant as a World Heritage Site?\nAnswer:", "answer": "The Acropolis of Athens is considered particularly significant as a World Heritage Site due to its representation of the heritage of the classical era, its status as a key landmark of early Western civilization, and its role as a masterpiece of human creativity and an exceptional testimony to an existing culture.

{"id": 4, "question": "Can energy be created or destroyed during motion?", "passages": [{"passage": "Kinetic energy, also known as the energy of motion, is all around us in different forms. Without Kinetic energy, also known as the energy of motion, there would be no light, heat, sound, or movement. Vibrating molecules produce heat, and subatomic particles called electrons can flow together to create electricity. From the basic movement of atoms producing heat to a car screeching to a stop, kinetic energy affects our everyday lives. In the context of physical science, several forms of energy have been identified. several forms of energy include: Forms of energy. Type of energy, Description. Kinetic, (≥0), that.

This video explains\nthe six types of energy, and I hope you enjoy! Check out my. The formula for Kinetic energy, and for some of the other forms of energy\ndescribed in this section will, is given in a later section of this primer. This lesson will explore the six types of energy. Energy forms are either potential or kinetic. Potential energy comes in forms that\nare stored including — chemical, gravitational, mechanical, and nuclear. Kinetic. Just like there are different forms of electricity, there are different types of energy\ntoo. The two main types of energy are: Kinetic Energy; Potential Energy. The six most common forms of electric energy are listed below. The electricity\ngenerated through The six most common forms of electric energy is measured in terawatt hours. Kinetic energy is the energy produced by an object in motion. There are five\ntypes of kinetic energy, each with multiple kinetic energy examples. Energy exists in many forms, such as heat, light, chemical energy, and electrical energy. Energy is the ability to bring about change or to do work. Thermodynamics is the study of energy. First Law of Thermodynamics: Energy can be changed from one form to another, but Energy cannot be created or destroyed. The total amount of energy and matter in the Universe remains constant, merely changing from one form to another. The First Law of Thermodynamics (Conservation) states that energy is always conserved, energy cannot be created or destroyed. In essence, energy can be converted from one form into another. Click here for another page (developed by Dr. , GA) covering thermodynamics. The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that \"in all energy exchanges, if no energy enters or leaves the system, the potential energy of the state will always be less than that of the initial state. \" This is also commonly referred to as entropy. A watchspring-driven watch will run until the potential energy in the spring is converted, and not again until energy is reapplied to the spring to rewind the spring. A car that has run out of gas will not run again until you walk 10 miles to a gas station and refuel A car that has run out of gas. Once the potential energy locked in carbohydrates is converted into kinetic energy (energy in use or motion), the organism will get no more until energy is input again. In the process of energy transfer, some energy will dissipate as heat. Entropy is a measure of disorder: cells are NOT disordered and so have low entropy. The flow of energy maintains order and life. Entropy wins when organisms cease to take in energy and die. Potential energy, as the name implies, is energy that has not yet been used, thus the term potential. Kinetic energy is energy in use (or motion). A tank of gasoline has a certain potential energy that is converted into kinetic energy by the engine. When a certain potential energy that is converted into kinetic energy by the engine is used up, you're outta gas! Batteries, when new or recharged, have a certain potential. When placed into a tape recorder and played at loud volume (the only settings for such things), the potential in the batteries is transformed into kinetic energy to drive the speakers. When the potential in the batteries is all used up, the batteries are dead. In the case of rechargeable batteries, rechargeable batteries's potential is reelevated or restored. Energy cannot be destroyed; Energy only changes form. E=Mc2. Einstein’s famous formula eloquently explains that the greater the mass of an object, the more energy an object possesses. Energy at Energy's purest form is light frequency. Light waves travel at almost 300 kilometers per second. Energy, light and mass - what does this have to do with our wellness? A good question. Cellular energy, such as the Krebs cycle energy production within the cell, is one type of energy. Cellular energy is often tested through traditional blood work or a saliva test to see how well the cells are expending the cells's energy and performing for the physical body. the thermal energy of the body is often tested with Computerized Regulation Thermography, which gives the trained bioregulatory practitioner a concise way to determine if there is proper regulatory capacity, under mild stress, within the organs, tissues and glands - again, based on the thermal energy of the body. Muscular energy plus muscle fatigue with the expenditure of sugars and oxygen can cause a build-up of byproducts from that energy burn, such as lactic acid buildup; a build-up of byproducts from that energy burn, such as lactic acid buildup can be understood more as the chemical energy of the body. Then, there is the electrical energy within the body. the electrical energy within the body is easy to access, and can help to evaluate heart and brain function. the electrical energy within the body is typically tested through various bio-feedback devices or muscle response testing in the bioregulatory world. Heart Rate Variability is another quantitative assessment of the electrical energy within the body that allows us to see the compensation ability of the individual through the energy waves produced by the heart, under a mild stress. Ultimately, we are all spiritual energy. Every move we make, every thought we have is an energy impulse. At the most fundamental level, our sense of touch, smell, taste, sight and sound are energy impulses to the brain giving us feedback from our environment. My favorite explanation of who we are energetically is from Dr. Joe Dispenza: “We are light energy held together by magnetic and gravitational forces. ” Everything we do is in some way directly related to maintaining and managing body energy.

The types of kinetic energy are:\n- Radiant energy is electromagnetic energy that travels in transverse waves (light, x-rays, gamma and radio waves). - Thermal energy, or heat, is the energy that comes from the movement of atoms and molecules in a substance (geothermal energy of the earth). - Motion energy is energy stored in the movement of objects. The faster objects move, the more energy is stored (wind). - Sound is the movement of energy through substances in compression/rarefaction waves. Sound is produced when a force causes an object or substance to vibrate. - Electrical energy is delivered by tiny charged particles called electrons, typically moving through a wire (lightning). View Single Post\nMar5-12, 12:08 PM\nWhat is energy?\nIs energy more of a bookeeping device for ultimately calculating the trajectory of the particle?\nYes, energy is just a numerical value, which happens to be conserved. Feynman on energy:. Energy can’t be created or destroyed, but Energy can move between objects and change forms. The energy of motion of a moving object is called kinetic energy, and is given by the equation\nKE = 0. 5m(v^2)\nWhere m is a moving object's mass, and v is a moving object's velocity. When you lift an object up from the ground, the energy you put into lifting an object becomes gravitational potential energy, given by PE = mgh, where m is mass, g is acceleration due to gravity (9. 8 meters per second), and h is height. When you stop holding up an object, an object starts to fall, and that gravitational potential energy transforms into kinetic energy (when an object actually hits the ground, that gravitational potential energy gets dispersed in a complicated mess of heat and mechanical deformation). The total energy isn’t going to change from start to finish. The total energy will just move entirely from potential to kinetic. At the start, The total energy’s all potential, given by mgh. (5)(9. 8)(200) = 9800 J That’s joules by the way, the basic unit of energy. This is all going to become kinetic energy, so:\n9800 = 0. 5m(v^2)\n9800 = 0. 5(5)(v^2)\n3920 = (v^2)\nsqrt(3920) = v = 62. 6 m/s\nthis method is an incredibly powerful trick. About The Author\n|Physics Guru And General Math And Science Enthusia|\n|I\\'ve always had a passion for learning science and then turning around and teaching science to anyone who will listen. The Author's interest led The Author to an undergrad degree in physics, an attempt at a teaching credential (which unfortunately imploded at 95% completion in an administrative snarl), a jump to a Master. As we know that energy is the capacity of the physical system to perform different tasks, without energy no work can be done. When the work is done, energy gets transferred from one body to the other as the external force, or sources always apply in the process of the work done. At the same time, it should be kept mentioned that energy can neither be created nor be destroyed. Around everything in the world possesses energy, but that doesn’t mean that energy always makes sure the work was done. energy can even be stored within the body. By object’s status with even possessing the energy, we mainly have two types of energy. One of which is the kinetic energy and the other is the potential energy. As both of them have the SI unit joule, people often found it difficult to differentiate it between both the types of energy. Kinetic energy is the type of energy, which a body possesses by the property of being in the motion. Contrary to this, the potential energy is the type of energy, which a body possesses by virtue of a body's position is known as the potential energy. What is Kinetic Energy?\nThe kinetic energy is the type of energy which a body possesses due to the virtue of being in the motion. In other words, we can say that The kinetic energy keeps the object in the motion. The motion of the object is evaluated with relation to the environment of the object. If the object changes the object's position with respect to the environment of the object, then the object is said to be in the motion. When the object is in the position of rest, and we pull the object, but due to a heavy mass, the object doesn’t move. To make the object move we apply more of the force on the object. At last, the object gets in the motion. In all this process, the energy is transferred from the one body to the other to produce acceleration in the object carrying certain mass is known as The kinetic energy. The kinetic energy is directly dependent on the speed and mass; the greater the speed and the mass, the more The kinetic energy. When the object finally stops, in then The kinetic energy gets converted into the potential energy. A misconception here prevails that the energy comes to an end, so the movement of the object stops, but that is not the case as the energy can’t be created nor be destroyed. 1:Matter is conserved because atoms are conserved in physical and chemical processes. 3:Energy may take different forms (e. 4:The transfer of energy can be tracked as energy flows through a designed or natural system. B2:Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but Energy can be transported from one place to another and transferred between systems\nHS-PS3. B3:Mathematical expressions, which quantify how the stored energy in a system depends on a system's configuration (e. B4:The availability of energy limits what can occur in any system. A1:Resource availability has guided the development of human society. A2:All forms of energy production and other resource extraction have associated economic, social, environmental, and geopolitical costs and risks as well as benefits. New technologies and social regulations can change the balance of associated economic, social, environmental, and geopolitical costs and risks as well as benefits. 2:Changes of energy and matter in a system can be described in terms of energy and matter flows into, out of, and within a system. 3:Energy cannot be created or destroyed—only moves between one place and another place, between objects and/or fields, or between systems. The work, W, done by a constant force on an object is defined as the product of the component of a constant force along the direction of displacement and the magnitude of displacement. Calculation of Work:\nWhen calculating work, only the force that is applied in the direction of motion is considered. W=Fdcosθ\nIf the force and displacement are in the same direction, that would be considered positive work. Power is a measure of how quickly work is done. Kinetic energy is energy of motion. All moving object possess kinetic energy. Gravitational Potential Energy:\nGravitational Potential energy is the energy an object possessed due to an object's position. The point that height is measured from. Conservation of Energy:\nEnergy cannot be created or destroyed; Energy may be transformed from one form into another, but the total amount of energy never changes. Energy implies as the object’s capability to perform work. Energy is something that cannot be created or destroyed but can only be transformed. An object loses An object's energy, when An object performs work, whereas An object gains energy when work is performed on An object. On the other hand, potential energy is the stored energy, because of potential energy's state of rest. As both the two forms of energy are measured in joules, people get easily confused between both the two forms of energy. Content: Kinetic Energy Vs Potential Energy\n|Basis for Comparison||Kinetic Energy||Potential Energy|\n|Meaning||Kinetic energy refers to an energy present in the object, due to the object's property of being in motion. ||The energy, contained in an object by virtue of an object's position, is called potential energy. |\n|Transferability||Can be transferred between objects. ||Cannot be transferred between objects. |\n|Measured from||Place itself||Bottom|\n|Environment-relative||Relative to the environment of the object. ||Non-relative to the environment of the object. |\n|Equation||0. 5 mv^2, where m = mass and v = speed||mgh, where m = mass, g = gravity and h = height|\nDefinition of Kinetic Energy\nSimply put, the energy of motion is kinetic energy. The work required for accelerating the object of a certain mass, from the state of rest to motion. energy is called kinetic energy, determined by speed and mass of the object, i. the greater the mass and speed, the more kinetic energy the object contains. The kinetic energy of an object, in motion, with a certain velocity, is same as the work performed on an object, in motion, with a certain velocity. All the objects that are in motion or action, irrespective of horizontal or vertical motion, possess kinetic energy. kinetic energy is the energy which an object acquires, owing to an object's state of motion. Conservation of mechanical energy equation\nWhat is the formula for conservation of mechanical energy?\nconservation of mechanical energy can be written as “KE + PE = const”. Though energy cannot be created nor destroyed in an isolated system, energy can be internally converted to any other form of energy. What is conservation of mechanical energy?\nIn physical sciences, mechanical energy is the sum of potential energy and kinetic energy. mechanical energy is the macroscopic energy associated with a system. The principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that if an isolated system is subject only to conservative forces, then the mechanical energy is constant. Is the mechanical energy conserved between A and B explain?\nMechanical energy is conserved so long as we ignore air resistance, friction, etc. Energy is “lost” to friction in the sense that Energy is not converted between potential and kinetic energy but rather into heat energy, which we cannot put back into the object. What are the 3 types of mechanical energy?\nMechanical energy is the energy that is possessed by an object due to an object's motion or due to an object's position. Mechanical energy can be either kinetic energy (energy of motion) or potential energy (stored energy of position). What are 5 mechanical energy examples?\nKinetic Mechanical EnergyRadiant Energy: Energy produced by light waves. Electrical Energy: Energy produced by electricity. Sound Energy: Energy produced by sound waves. Thermal Energy: Energy produced by heat. What is work formula?\nWork is done when a force that is applied to an object moves an object. Work is calculated by multiplying a force that is applied to an object by the amount of movement of an object (W = F * d). What is mechanical energy in simple words?\nThe energy of an object due to an object's motion or position; the sum of an object’s kinetic energy and potential energy. Is a windmill an example of mechanical energy?\nWind Mill Windmills are the structures that convert wind energy into electrical energy and electrical energy is then supplied to our homes. Windmills run on the principle of mechanical energy and work. Moving air (wind) possesses some amount of energy in the form of kinetic energy (due to motion). Is a roller coaster an example of mechanical energy?\nKinetic energy is energy that an object has because of an object's motion. All moving objects possess kinetic energy, which is determined by the mass and speed of the object. In a roller coaster, the forms of kinetic are mechanical, sound and thermal. Combining it with Coulomb's law results\nin the Lorentz Force equation, so we don't really need to add Lorentz's\nequation to our pantry. Another fundamental and perhaps the most important\ninvariant is \"The Law of Least Action\" (may\nbe called the \"Law of Least-Known\"), which was originally based\non mechanics but can be applied to electrodynamics, thermodynamics, potential,\ntime and space. Objects tend to move in the direction of least energy. Planck\ndescribed this law as interpreted by Helmholtz and stated that this law plays\nthe principal role in the interpretation of all physical laws.

Thermodynamics is the study of heat energy and other types of energy, such as work, and the various ways energy is transferred within chemical systems. \"Thermo-\" refers to heat, while \"dynamics\" refers to motion. The First Law of Thermodynamics\nThe First Law of Thermodynamics deals with the total amount of energy in the universe. The First Law of Thermodynamics states that the total amount of energy in the universe is constant. In other words, there has always been, and always will be, exactly the same amount of energy in the universe. Energy exists in many different forms. According to The First Law of Thermodynamics, energy can be transferred from place to place or changed between different forms, but energy cannot be created or destroyed. The transfers and transformations of energy take place around us all the time. For instance, light bulbs transform electrical energy into light energy, and gas stoves transform chemical energy from natural gas into heat energy. Plants perform one of the most biologically useful transformations of energy on Earth: Plants convert the energy of sunlight into the chemical energy stored within organicmolecules. Thermodynamics often divides the universe into two categories: the system and the system's surroundings. In chemistry, the system almost always refers to a given chemical reaction and the container in which a given chemical reaction takes place. The First Law of Thermodynamics tells us that energy can neither be created nor destroyed, so we know that the energy that is absorbed in an endothermic chemical reaction must have been lost from the surroundings. Conversely, in an exothermic reaction, the heat that is released in an exothermic reaction is given off and absorbed by the surroundings. Stated mathematically, we have:\nWe know that chemical systems can either absorb heat from chemical systems's surroundings, if the reaction is endothermic, or release heat to chemical systems's surroundings, if the reaction is exothermic. However, chemical reactions are often used to do work instead of just exchanging heat. For instance, when rocket fuel burns and causes a space shuttle to lift off from the ground, the chemical reaction, by propelling a space shuttle, is doing work by applying a force over a distance.", "score": 7.45481938123703, "doc_IDs": ["<urn:uuid:14c9e885-f603-4887-b8e3-f93108db4585>", "<urn:uuid:0f44a414-6e63-4ce4-8a88-295da0f0fb6d>", "<urn:uuid:e798f86e-18dd-4bc8-9fc2-d764e7cf3146>", "<urn:uuid:9c0efd95-50e8-4d84-8783-186724c11dfa>", "<urn:uuid:6a54b93a-283e-4f7d-a649-5949b8971c67>", "<urn:uuid:21a73789-78b2-4737-8930-e251f9756cc0>", "<urn:uuid:c470f63c-eb21-41a9-8987-e8fe4103d3bf>", "<urn:uuid:12784331-3d46-452b-b312-7487831a76b9>", "<urn:uuid:09212ef1-9035-440d-ad4a-ae5fe2d6d087>", "<urn:uuid:26da7408-f300-45d1-a192-3ee41d2ba20c>", "<urn:uuid:574dd49a-c893-4cf8-b7b0-76474f1af4e1>", "<urn:uuid:e3317c03-b8c0-4696-b728-c78a57570570>", "<urn:uuid:3ef3e11e-8b94-4673-aa92-486aa13d2f8f>", "<urn:uuid:ac6af325-1411-47e9-9f7c-e6cad20ad524>", "<urn:uuid:cd16415c-bd7e-4518-98eb-142cdcecfb0d>", "<urn:uuid:0d2f9940-8dbb-4bb2-8056-55612da65692>"]}], "final_prompt": "You are a knowledgeable assistant. Answer the following question using only the context provided below.\n\n----\nContext Document 1: Kinetic energy, also known as the energy of motion, is all around us in different forms. Without Kinetic energy, also known as the energy of motion, there would be no light, heat, sound, or movement. Vibrating molecules produce heat, and subatomic particles called electrons can flow together to create electricity. From the basic movement of atoms producing heat to a car screeching to a stop, kinetic energy affects our everyday lives. In the context of physical science, several forms of energy have been identified. several forms of energy include: Forms of energy. Type of energy, Description. Kinetic, (≥0), that.

This video explains\nthe six types of energy, and I hope you enjoy! Check out my. The formula for Kinetic energy, and for some of the other forms of energy\ndescribed in this section will, is given in a later section of this primer. This lesson will explore the six types of energy. Energy forms are either potential or kinetic. Potential energy comes in forms that\nare stored including — chemical, gravitational, mechanical, and nuclear. Kinetic. Just like there are different forms of electricity, there are different types of energy\ntoo. The two main types of energy are: Kinetic Energy; Potential Energy. The six most common forms of electric energy are listed below. The electricity\ngenerated through The six most common forms of electric energy is measured in terawatt hours. Kinetic energy is the energy produced by an object in motion. There are five\ntypes of kinetic energy, each with multiple kinetic energy examples. Energy exists in many forms, such as heat, light, chemical energy, and electrical energy. Energy is the ability to bring about change or to do work. Thermodynamics is the study of energy. First Law of Thermodynamics: Energy can be changed from one form to another, but Energy cannot be created or destroyed. The total amount of energy and matter in the Universe remains constant, merely changing from one form to another. The First Law of Thermodynamics (Conservation) states that energy is always conserved, energy cannot be created or destroyed. In essence, energy can be converted from one form into another. Click here for another page (developed by Dr. , GA) covering thermodynamics. The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that \"in all energy exchanges, if no energy enters or leaves the system, the potential energy of the state will always be less than that of the initial state. \" This is also commonly referred to as entropy. A watchspring-driven watch will run until the potential energy in the spring is converted, and not again until energy is reapplied to the spring to rewind the spring. A car that has run out of gas will not run again until you walk 10 miles to a gas station and refuel A car that has run out of gas. Once the potential energy locked in carbohydrates is converted into kinetic energy (energy in use or motion), the organism will get no more until energy is input again. In the process of energy transfer, some energy will dissipate as heat. Entropy is a measure of disorder: cells are NOT disordered and so have low entropy. The flow of energy maintains order and life. Entropy wins when organisms cease to take in energy and die. Potential energy, as the name implies, is energy that has not yet been used, thus the term potential. Kinetic energy is energy in use (or motion). A tank of gasoline has a certain potential energy that is converted into kinetic energy by the engine. When a certain potential energy that is converted into kinetic energy by the engine is used up, you're outta gas! Batteries, when new or recharged, have a certain potential. When placed into a tape recorder and played at loud volume (the only settings for such things), the potential in the batteries is transformed into kinetic energy to drive the speakers. When the potential in the batteries is all used up, the batteries are dead. In the case of rechargeable batteries, rechargeable batteries's potential is reelevated or restored. Energy cannot be destroyed; Energy only changes form. E=Mc2. Einstein’s famous formula eloquently explains that the greater the mass of an object, the more energy an object possesses. Energy at Energy's purest form is light frequency. Light waves travel at almost 300 kilometers per second. Energy, light and mass - what does this have to do with our wellness? A good question. Cellular energy, such as the Krebs cycle energy production within the cell, is one type of energy. Cellular energy is often tested through traditional blood work or a saliva test to see how well the cells are expending the cells's energy and performing for the physical body. the thermal energy of the body is often tested with Computerized Regulation Thermography, which gives the trained bioregulatory practitioner a concise way to determine if there is proper regulatory capacity, under mild stress, within the organs, tissues and glands - again, based on the thermal energy of the body. Muscular energy plus muscle fatigue with the expenditure of sugars and oxygen can cause a build-up of byproducts from that energy burn, such as lactic acid buildup; a build-up of byproducts from that energy burn, such as lactic acid buildup can be understood more as the chemical energy of the body. Then, there is the electrical energy within the body. the electrical energy within the body is easy to access, and can help to evaluate heart and brain function. the electrical energy within the body is typically tested through various bio-feedback devices or muscle response testing in the bioregulatory world. Heart Rate Variability is another quantitative assessment of the electrical energy within the body that allows us to see the compensation ability of the individual through the energy waves produced by the heart, under a mild stress. Ultimately, we are all spiritual energy. Every move we make, every thought we have is an energy impulse. At the most fundamental level, our sense of touch, smell, taste, sight and sound are energy impulses to the brain giving us feedback from our environment. My favorite explanation of who we are energetically is from Dr. Joe Dispenza: “We are light energy held together by magnetic and gravitational forces. ” Everything we do is in some way directly related to maintaining and managing body energy.

The types of kinetic energy are:\n- Radiant energy is electromagnetic energy that travels in transverse waves (light, x-rays, gamma and radio waves). - Thermal energy, or heat, is the energy that comes from the movement of atoms and molecules in a substance (geothermal energy of the earth). - Motion energy is energy stored in the movement of objects. The faster objects move, the more energy is stored (wind). - Sound is the movement of energy through substances in compression/rarefaction waves. Sound is produced when a force causes an object or substance to vibrate. - Electrical energy is delivered by tiny charged particles called electrons, typically moving through a wire (lightning). View Single Post\nMar5-12, 12:08 PM\nWhat is energy?\nIs energy more of a bookeeping device for ultimately calculating the trajectory of the particle?\nYes, energy is just a numerical value, which happens to be conserved. Feynman on energy:. Energy can’t be created or destroyed, but Energy can move between objects and change forms. The energy of motion of a moving object is called kinetic energy, and is given by the equation\nKE = 0. 5m(v^2)\nWhere m is a moving object's mass, and v is a moving object's velocity. When you lift an object up from the ground, the energy you put into lifting an object becomes gravitational potential energy, given by PE = mgh, where m is mass, g is acceleration due to gravity (9. 8 meters per second), and h is height. When you stop holding up an object, an object starts to fall, and that gravitational potential energy transforms into kinetic energy (when an object actually hits the ground, that gravitational potential energy gets dispersed in a complicated mess of heat and mechanical deformation). The total energy isn’t going to change from start to finish. The total energy will just move entirely from potential to kinetic. At the start, The total energy’s all potential, given by mgh. (5)(9. 8)(200) = 9800 J That’s joules by the way, the basic unit of energy. This is all going to become kinetic energy, so:\n9800 = 0. 5m(v^2)\n9800 = 0. 5(5)(v^2)\n3920 = (v^2)\nsqrt(3920) = v = 62. 6 m/s\nthis method is an incredibly powerful trick. About The Author\n|Physics Guru And General Math And Science Enthusia|\n|I\\'ve always had a passion for learning science and then turning around and teaching science to anyone who will listen. The Author's interest led The Author to an undergrad degree in physics, an attempt at a teaching credential (which unfortunately imploded at 95% completion in an administrative snarl), a jump to a Master. As we know that energy is the capacity of the physical system to perform different tasks, without energy no work can be done. When the work is done, energy gets transferred from one body to the other as the external force, or sources always apply in the process of the work done. At the same time, it should be kept mentioned that energy can neither be created nor be destroyed. Around everything in the world possesses energy, but that doesn’t mean that energy always makes sure the work was done. energy can even be stored within the body. By object’s status with even possessing the energy, we mainly have two types of energy. One of which is the kinetic energy and the other is the potential energy. As both of them have the SI unit joule, people often found it difficult to differentiate it between both the types of energy. Kinetic energy is the type of energy, which a body possesses by the property of being in the motion. Contrary to this, the potential energy is the type of energy, which a body possesses by virtue of a body's position is known as the potential energy. What is Kinetic Energy?\nThe kinetic energy is the type of energy which a body possesses due to the virtue of being in the motion. In other words, we can say that The kinetic energy keeps the object in the motion. The motion of the object is evaluated with relation to the environment of the object. If the object changes the object's position with respect to the environment of the object, then the object is said to be in the motion. When the object is in the position of rest, and we pull the object, but due to a heavy mass, the object doesn’t move. To make the object move we apply more of the force on the object. At last, the object gets in the motion. In all this process, the energy is transferred from the one body to the other to produce acceleration in the object carrying certain mass is known as The kinetic energy. The kinetic energy is directly dependent on the speed and mass; the greater the speed and the mass, the more The kinetic energy. When the object finally stops, in then The kinetic energy gets converted into the potential energy. A misconception here prevails that the energy comes to an end, so the movement of the object stops, but that is not the case as the energy can’t be created nor be destroyed. 1:Matter is conserved because atoms are conserved in physical and chemical processes. 3:Energy may take different forms (e. 4:The transfer of energy can be tracked as energy flows through a designed or natural system. B2:Energy cannot be created or destroyed, but Energy can be transported from one place to another and transferred between systems\nHS-PS3. B3:Mathematical expressions, which quantify how the stored energy in a system depends on a system's configuration (e. B4:The availability of energy limits what can occur in any system. A1:Resource availability has guided the development of human society. A2:All forms of energy production and other resource extraction have associated economic, social, environmental, and geopolitical costs and risks as well as benefits. New technologies and social regulations can change the balance of associated economic, social, environmental, and geopolitical costs and risks as well as benefits. 2:Changes of energy and matter in a system can be described in terms of energy and matter flows into, out of, and within a system. 3:Energy cannot be created or destroyed—only moves between one place and another place, between objects and/or fields, or between systems. The work, W, done by a constant force on an object is defined as the product of the component of a constant force along the direction of displacement and the magnitude of displacement. Calculation of Work:\nWhen calculating work, only the force that is applied in the direction of motion is considered. W=Fdcosθ\nIf the force and displacement are in the same direction, that would be considered positive work. Power is a measure of how quickly work is done. Kinetic energy is energy of motion. All moving object possess kinetic energy. Gravitational Potential Energy:\nGravitational Potential energy is the energy an object possessed due to an object's position. The point that height is measured from. Conservation of Energy:\nEnergy cannot be created or destroyed; Energy may be transformed from one form into another, but the total amount of energy never changes. Energy implies as the object’s capability to perform work. Energy is something that cannot be created or destroyed but can only be transformed. An object loses An object's energy, when An object performs work, whereas An object gains energy when work is performed on An object. On the other hand, potential energy is the stored energy, because of potential energy's state of rest. As both the two forms of energy are measured in joules, people get easily confused between both the two forms of energy.

The work required for accelerating the object of a certain mass, from the state of rest to motion. energy is called kinetic energy, determined by speed and mass of the object, i. the greater the mass and speed, the more kinetic energy the object contains. The kinetic energy of an object, in motion, with a certain velocity, is same as the work performed on an object, in motion, with a certain velocity. All the objects that are in motion or action, irrespective of horizontal or vertical motion, possess kinetic energy. kinetic energy is the energy which an object acquires, owing to an object's state of motion. Conservation of mechanical energy equation\nWhat is the formula for conservation of mechanical energy?\nconservation of mechanical energy can be written as “KE + PE = const”. Though energy cannot be created nor destroyed in an isolated system, energy can be internally converted to any other form of energy. What is conservation of mechanical energy?\nIn physical sciences, mechanical energy is the sum of potential energy and kinetic energy. mechanical energy is the macroscopic energy associated with a system. The principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that if an isolated system is subject only to conservative forces, then the mechanical energy is constant. Is the mechanical energy conserved between A and B explain?\nMechanical energy is conserved so long as we ignore air resistance, friction, etc. Energy is “lost” to friction in the sense that Energy is not converted between potential and kinetic energy but rather into heat energy, which we cannot put back into the object. What are the 3 types of mechanical energy?\nMechanical energy is the energy that is possessed by an object due to an object's motion or due to an object's position. Mechanical energy can be either kinetic energy (energy of motion) or potential energy (stored energy of position). What are 5 mechanical energy examples?\nKinetic Mechanical EnergyRadiant Energy: Energy produced by light waves. Electrical Energy: Energy produced by electricity. Sound Energy: Energy produced by sound waves. Thermal Energy: Energy produced by heat. What is work formula?\nWork is done when a force that is applied to an object moves an object. Work is calculated by multiplying a force that is applied to an object by the amount of movement of an object (W = F * d). What is mechanical energy in simple words?\nThe energy of an object due to an object's motion or position; the sum of an object’s kinetic energy and potential energy. Is a windmill an example of mechanical energy?\nWind Mill Windmills are the structures that convert wind energy into electrical energy and electrical energy is then supplied to our homes. Windmills run on the principle of mechanical energy and work. Moving air (wind) possesses some amount of energy in the form of kinetic energy (due to motion). Is a roller coaster an example of mechanical energy?\nKinetic energy is energy that an object has because of an object's motion. All moving objects possess kinetic energy, which is determined by the mass and speed of the object. In a roller coaster, the forms of kinetic are mechanical, sound and thermal. Combining it with Coulomb's law results\nin the Lorentz Force equation, so we don't really need to add Lorentz's\nequation to our pantry. Another fundamental and perhaps the most important\ninvariant is \"The Law of Least Action\" (may\nbe called the \"Law of Least-Known\"), which was originally based\non mechanics but can be applied to electrodynamics, thermodynamics, potential,\ntime and space. Objects tend to move in the direction of least energy. Planck\ndescribed this law as interpreted by Helmholtz and stated that this law plays\nthe principal role in the interpretation of all physical laws. The sum of the external work is equal to the extra energy expended\nin a process. There can be extra stored energy (in a system) that is not\nan essential part of this equation since extra stored energy (in a system) that is not\nan essential part of this equation since it does no work and is not expended does no work and is not expended. The forces acting on the electron and the proton, the direction,\nvelocity and acceleration, all as described above. this law is of greatest importance In fact, Helmholtz believed that this law is\nfundamental to the unification of the system of theoretical physics,since\nthis law connects together the elementary quantities by which physical phenomena\nare measured. this law connects together the elementary quantities by which physical\nphenomena are measured and from which physical laws can be interpreted. this law describes how electrical charges form masses, how motion occurs and how\nmass is created and destroyed. \"this law connects together in a single equation\nthe relationships between quantities which possess, not only for mechanics,\nthe quantities space, time and potential\".

According to the First Law of Thermodynamics, also known as the Law of Conservation of Energy, energy can only be transformed from one form to another, but the total amount of energy in a closed system remains constant. This means that while energy can change forms, such as from potential energy to kinetic energy during motion, the total energy before and after the transformation remains the same."}

Look for pedestrians and use your turn signal before you exit. If there is no traffic in the roundabout, you may enter without yielding. The back wheels of the oversize vehicle can ride up on a truck apron, a raised section of pavement around the central island that acts as an extra lane for large vehicles so the truck can easily complete the turn, while the raised portion of concrete discourages use by smaller vehicles. utilize the two right most lanes on major highways and roadways or drive only on the access road that runs parallel. occupy all lanes of traffic backing up or bottle necking traffic due to the multiple times oversized vehicles, 18 wheelers, etc. Happy motoring.

When Drivers neglect to do so, Drivers are operating with negligence and can seriously injure another driver, pedestrian or cyclist. Drivers often think red lights are a good time to check Drivers's phone or e-mail. One solution is to create more traffic islands on wider streets to provide a safe place for pedestrians to stand before crossing the second half of the street. Additionally, staying a distance away from your vehicle may give the driver more time to slow down or maneuver when necessary. The fourth blind spot is in front of the truck. Passenger vehicle drivers should stay behind the white lines painted on the road to give Passenger vehicle drivers enough room to turn. Staying away could help you avoid a truck crash.

Every experienced big rig driver will admit that negotiating a right turn can be downright dangerous and likely have many accounts Every experienced big rig driver could tell demonstrating this. Clearly, the size of the big rigs the big rigs themselves require that the big rig operators understand the special techniques required to negotiate right hand turns and be even more vigilant for pedestrians and vehicles around the big rig operators while the big rig operators negotiate the turn. A common scenario leading to a collision between a big rig and an auto during a right hand turn is due to the ‘swinging rear. In other words, to the left. This can cause a portion of the rear of the trailer to up several inches (perhaps even feet) over into the adjoining lane. Should a car be there while the truck is ‘swinging’ over into the adjoining lane and comes into contact with another car, the force has at times caused these cars to be then pushed out of these cars's lane and into the next adjoining lane resulting in the middle car getting crushed. The collisions are especially dangerous when the car that got hit by the rear of the truck gets pushed in a lane involving traffic going in the opposite direction. The size and length of many tractor trailers is an issue when negotiating the right turn which can be compounded if the street is not very wide. Oftentimes, truck drivers find truck drivers actually crossing the double lines of a two way street in order to get truck drivers's big rig setup to complete the right hand turn. Therefore, many 18 wheeler tractor trailer collisions involve vehicles that were heading in the opposite direction of the big rig but were struck during the turn. At times, a pedestrian will pass while the big rig while the big rig is negotiating the right hand turn. Many pedestrians, especially children, have nearly no experience walking near big rigs and may not take into consideration that the big rig will come swinging back. Other times, a big rig operator will simply end up crossing into the bike or pedestrian lanes taking the bicyclist or pedestrian by surprise. Sadly these accidents usually result in severe injury or death. We at the Law Offices of Edward A. Smith respects those in the big rig community and the services those in the big rig community provide our nation. Many tractor trailer operators have years of safe driving habits. Many, however, have not been adequately trained in safety. When it comes to truck driving, safety is paramount. If you’re a truck driver, you need to make sure you’re doing all you can, all the time, to keep yourself and your fellow road users safe and to ensure you don’t let accidents strip you of your trucking authority. Be aware of YOUR speed limits\nMore often than not, speed limit signs will dictate one maximum speed limit for smaller vehicles, and another one for larger ones. Your truck will fall under the larger-vehicle limit, which will be slower than the one imposed on cars, and it is of the utmost importance that you are aware of this. Do not confuse the limits, as doing so will see you go faster than you should be going with your type of vehicle, and will, therefore, make you more of a danger. You should be particularly aware of your speed when you come to turns in the road. Trucks are far more likely to lose control of Trucks as Trucks curve than cars are, and Trucks's drivers MUST slow down when their drivers's road begins to deviate. Pay attention to your space cushion\nyour space cushion is the room that immediately surrounds your truck on all of your truck's sides, and other vehicles shouldn’t be encroaching upon your space cushion. Of course, you cannot account for other drivers, and anybody could get too close to you at any time. What you can account for, however, is your own driving skills, and making sure your truck never gets too close to anything else that your truck shares the road with. Importantly, this means maintaining a safe distance between yourself and the vehicle in front of you. As your truck will have more weight, size, and power than all of the cars that your truck follows, you going into the back of one can and will cause serious damage. Trucks/oversize vehicles and roundabouts\nRoundabouts are designed to accommodate vehicles of all sizes, including emergency vehicles, buses, farm equipment and semitrucks with trailers. Oversize vehicles and vehicles with trailers may straddle both lanes while driving through a roundabout. Many roundabouts are also designed with a truck apron, a raised section of pavement around the central island that acts as an extra lane for large vehicles. Because large vehicles may need extra room to complete large vehicles's turn in a roundabout, drivers should remember never to drive next to large vehicles in a roundabout. Review & Submit Ideas\nRecommendation: During rush hour, oversized vehicles, 18 wheelers, etc. Explanation: Currently, oversized vehicles, 18 wheelers, etc. need to down shift to break or slow down and re-shift to speed up. During rush hour, oversized vehicles, 18 wheelers, etc. are constantly shifting gears, therefore, causing highway/roadway traffic to backup. Current complications: Since oversized vehicles, 18 wheelers, etc. occupy all lanes oversized vehicles, 18 wheelers, etc. - Extend travel time during rush hour for all commuters’. - Reduce personal/family time. - Unsafe conditions for law enforcement involved in a traffic stop. - Emergency response vehicles are delayed. - Higher level of vehicle pollution\n- Higher gasoline consumption. - Road rage\n- Traffic moves more freely. Reduced travel times for rush hour commuters’. - More personal time/family time. - Safer conditions for law enforcement. - Emergency response vehicles are able to arrive on seen faster. - Environmentally friendly; reduced pollution. - Less gasoline consumption. - Makes for a friendlier city. Less driver stress/minimized road rage. Why do some cars seem to drive down the road sideways?\nI never drink and drive but I swear every Chevy Nova (pre-1985) and Olds Omega (same car--different label) I see is driving down the road sideways. Well, not quite sideways but at an acute angle. Was this the product of foresighted GM engineers trying to provide a more panoramic view for drivers and passengers alike, or merely a flashback from my chemical abuse days?\nI don't know where you young people learned to be so sarcastic--certainly not from me. For your information, the peculiarities of the Nova have nothing to do with either your mental state or GM's desire to simplify angle parking. Older Novas and Omegas, as well as Pontiac Venturas and Buick Apollos, are vulnerable to an embarrassing defect that involves misalignment of the rear axle. The axle, you see, is attached to the car by a couple of leaf springs, the things under the car that look like a horizontal parenthesis. (Cecil loves these homely metaphors. ) In the center of each spring there's a locator pin that's supposed to fit into a hole in the axle assembly and keep the axle assembly lined up properly. Unfortunately, the pins have an annoying tendency to shear off, whereupon The axle slips out of parallel and the car heads around in a circle. To overcome this, the driver has to keep the front wheels turned in the opposite direction, with the result that the driver heads down the road sidesaddle. an embarrassing defect that involves misalignment of the rear axle was most common in Novas from the mid-70s; supposedly some cars were already goofed up when some cars left the factory. GM, for GM's part, says, \"Don't consider an embarrassing defect that involves misalignment of the rear axle a manufacturing problem. \" In other words, sucker, an embarrassing defect that involves misalignment of the rear axle's your problem. Longer wheel bases on motorhomes and trucks towing RV trailers make it necessary to change your turning patterns. You must turn wider at intersections or the rear wheel may roll over the curb. Go further into the intersection before starting the turn and adjust your lane position to increase the turning radius. Stay more to the center of the lane for right turns so the rear wheels will not move off the pavement. For a left turn or curve, stay more to the right of the lane to prevent the back of the trailer from tracking into the oncoming lane\nRecreational vehicles have a high center of gravity, so turning corners and taking curves must be done at slower speeds to prevent swaying. Slowdown before you enter the curve. Be sure you use your rear-view mirrors to watch tracking and tail swing. Driving alongside an 18-wheeler big rig or semi truck can be scary. Not only is the sheer size of a large truck intimidating, but at some point while sharing the road with one, we inevitably stop and think about just how devastating an accident with such a monstrous vehicle would be. Truck accidents can cause a horrendous amount of destruction due to how much weight and force Truck accidents carry. Luckily, there are a few things any driver can do to stay safe while sharing the road with large trucks. Here are some tips:\n- Always be especially alert when driving near a large trailer truck or big rig. Trucks have massive blind spots and a higher cab, so it can be difficult for truck drivers to see passenger cars. Avoid driving in a truck’s blind spots and make yourself visible directly from the driver’s cab if possible. If you can see the driver in the driver's mirror, the driver should be able to see you as well. - Turn your headlights on in conditions where the light is low to help truck drivers see your better. - Keep a safer difference than you normally would when following or driving alongside a large truck. The driver will need to make a wide turn and a wide turn may be wider than you expect. While waiting your turn at an intersection, for example, you may want to give the truck the entire intersection to make the truck's turn before moving forward. - Give large trucks more space to stop. The larger the vehicle, the more time it takes for the driver to stop. Overcompensate if you have to. A large truck with full cargo can take as much as 300 yards to come to a complete stop from 60mph. - When driving around a large truck, plan your moves well ahead of time and give truck drivers more time to respond to your actions. - Use your turn signals earlier and merge/change lanes ahead of time. the right side has fewer blind spots than the left. THE weather is wet and windy as you are driving along a busy road. If you crank open the window to stick your arm out you’ll let in a blast of uncomfortable air; if you don’t, you’ll risk trouble with drivers behind and ahead of you and with pedestrians at the curb. - Anticipate that a tractor-trailer will make wide turns. If a truck has a turn signal flashing, do not try to squeeze by a truck. When stopped at intersections, do not stop in front of the line. Trucks need that space to make wide turns. - Be sure to wear your seat belt when in a car. - Do not drive while impaired under any circumstances. - Watch out for other drivers who may be impaired, and report other drivers who may be impaired to the police. - Avoid distractions and keep your eyes on the road. - Leave early and give yourself plenty of time to reach your destination.

Causes of Car Accidents at Intersections\nMassachusetts has some old and antiquated roads and intersections. Motor vehicle accidents can happen when a roadway is defective and not maintained. But more often, car accidents happen at intersections when drivers are not paying attention and cannot respond quickly to road conditions. Distracted driving crashes kill 9 people each day in the U. , according to the CDC. Many of Distracted driving crashes occur at intersections. For example, intersections on wider streets are designed to allow large vehicles like trucks and buses to make turns quickly and easily. This makes pedestrians cross longer distances to reach the safety of the sidewalk on the other side. Various pedestrian safety measures and technologies are being instituted around the country. Various pedestrian safety measures and technologies include giving a dedicated crossing signal for pedestrians to cross exclusively, a crosswalk signal that gives pedestrians head start over cars, pedestrian-activated no turn on red indicator lights, and mid-block traffic signals for pedestrian traffic. Despite, slowing vehicular traffic, Various pedestrian safety measures and technologies do work. The good news is that largely due to technology, traffic accidents and fatalities have decreased and vehicles have become safer. Employing the same ingenuity with which this was accomplished, we can make our streets safer for pedestrians. Anyone who has ever traveled on a freeway or highway has probably come into range of a large truck or semi. These vehicles are massive in comparison to smaller passenger vehicles, so it makes sense that drivers may feel wary when drivers approach larger trucks. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration explains that it’s important to give large trucks enough space around large trucks. Doing so makes it possible for the driver to see your vehicle by keeping the blind spots clear. Large trucks have four main blind spots\nWhen you approach a semitruck from the back, remember that there are four blind spots that you need to keep your vehicle out of. The first blind spot is directly behind the vehicle. If you are close enough to the back that you can’t see the driver’s mirrors, the driver cannot see you. Two additional blind spots run along the sides of a semi. Two additional blind spots are areas in which the mirror is angled in a way that the mirror will miss any vehicles next to the truck, and the driver won’t see any vehicles next to the truck when looking over, either. If you weave in front of the truck too closely, the driver won’t be able to see you over the front hood. Stopping distances are a challenge for large truck drivers\nAnother reason you need to give more space to large trucks is because of large trucks's stopping distances. Trucks, buses and other large vehicles need more time to stop, so you’ll want to be several car lengths ahead of the vehicle at all times. Turns become problematic for truck drivers\nDue to the shape of a large truck, drivers often have trouble turning and staying in the correct lane when turning right. drivers may swing wide to make enough room for drivers's trailers. These are a few reasons why you need to be aware of large trucks and maintain your distance. It is always best to assume that the driver cannot see you and to drive accordingly. Make Sure They Have Room to Turn\nThe size of large trucks also makes it difficult for large trucks to make turns. Large trucks make wide turns. Give Large trucks extra turning space. Large trucks often swing wide and may even start a turn from a middle lane. Give Large trucks room and never try to squeeze by a turning truck or enter the space between the turning truck and the curb. Stay Away from Large trucks When It’s Raining or Snowing\nIf you have ever shared the road with a large truck when it was raining, snowing, or there had recently been rain or snow, you know that another danger of sharing the road with a large truck is the spraying and splashing it creates. Snow, water, and mud can all get splash off a truck’s large multitude of tires onto a car’s windshield. Give trucks extra space under these kinds of weather conditions.

Pedestrians can also be crushed during a right hand turn scenario. The sheer size of the vehicles alone makes the vehicles a hazard on the road, and the vehicles are far more likely to cause accidents and injuries than cars, motorbikes, and cycles are. For this reason, you should stay two vehicle lengths behind cars when the traffic is free-flowing, allowing you a safe stop time should the course you are taking dictate you to halt.

Look for pedestrians and use your turn signal before you exit. If there is no traffic in the roundabout, you may enter without yielding. The back wheels of the oversize vehicle can ride up on a truck apron, a raised section of pavement around the central island that acts as an extra lane for large vehicles so the truck can easily complete the turn, while the raised portion of concrete discourages use by smaller vehicles. utilize the two right most lanes on major highways and roadways or drive only on the access road that runs parallel. occupy all lanes of traffic backing up or bottle necking traffic due to the multiple times oversized vehicles, 18 wheelers, etc. Happy motoring. Curves in the highway can also be tricky. Look out for any sudden swerves or movements. - Make sure you’re always visible to the driver of a large trailer truck or big rig. Keep an extra lane between a large truck and your vehicle if possible. - Give trucks as much room as possible when you notice trucks’re making a turn.

When Drivers neglect to do so, Drivers are operating with negligence and can seriously injure another driver, pedestrian or cyclist. Drivers often think red lights are a good time to check Drivers's phone or e-mail. One solution is to create more traffic islands on wider streets to provide a safe place for pedestrians to stand before crossing the second half of the street. Additionally, staying a distance away from your vehicle may give the driver more time to slow down or maneuver when necessary. The fourth blind spot is in front of the truck. Passenger vehicle drivers should stay behind the white lines painted on the road to give Passenger vehicle drivers enough room to turn. Staying away could help you avoid a truck crash. This can seriously compromise your visibility. -- must have approval from the Alabama Department of Transportation before imposing any restrictions, Wendell \"Butch\" Stokes, city engineer, said Wednesday. 59 or off U. \"If trucks were going straight through FOLEY, Ala. --. 59 would then go south on the Foley Beach Express and turn on U. Our Lawyers Can Represent You\nAt Our Lawyers, Our Lawyers understand that collisions with large trucks can be devastating. In the context of the 1848 liberal revolutions that swept through Europe, an unsuccessful war was declared on Austria. Finally, as France during the disastrous Franco-Prussian War of 1870 abandoned France's garrisons in Rome, the House of Savoy rushed to fill the power gap by taking over the Papal States. In 1859 Garibaldi was fighting the Austrians in north Italy once more, this time successfully. Others relocated to the northern industrial cities such as Genoa, Milan and Turin, and sent money home. In 1866 Prussian Prime Minister Otto von Bismarck offered king Victor Emmanuel II of the Savoy dynasty, which ruled over Piedmont an alliance with the Kingdom of Prussia in the Austro-Prussian War. In exchange the Kingdom of Prussia would allow Italy to annex Austrian-controlled Venice.\n\nContext Document 2: Truck drivers admittedly recognize that making a right turn with Truck drivers's long and heavy loads is not easy. Every experienced big rig driver will admit that negotiating a right turn can be downright dangerous and likely have many accounts Every experienced big rig driver could tell demonstrating this. Clearly, the size of the big rigs the big rigs themselves require that the big rig operators understand the special techniques required to negotiate right hand turns and be even more vigilant for pedestrians and vehicles around the big rig operators while the big rig operators negotiate the turn. A common scenario leading to a collision between a big rig and an auto during a right hand turn is due to the ‘swinging rear. In other words, to the left. This can cause a portion of the rear of the trailer to up several inches (perhaps even feet) over into the adjoining lane. Should a car be there while the truck is ‘swinging’ over into the adjoining lane and comes into contact with another car, the force has at times caused these cars to be then pushed out of these cars's lane and into the next adjoining lane resulting in the middle car getting crushed. The collisions are especially dangerous when the car that got hit by the rear of the truck gets pushed in a lane involving traffic going in the opposite direction. The size and length of many tractor trailers is an issue when negotiating the right turn which can be compounded if the street is not very wide. Oftentimes, truck drivers find truck drivers actually crossing the double lines of a two way street in order to get truck drivers's big rig setup to complete the right hand turn. Therefore, many 18 wheeler tractor trailer collisions involve vehicles that were heading in the opposite direction of the big rig but were struck during the turn. At times, a pedestrian will pass while the big rig while the big rig is negotiating the right hand turn. Many pedestrians, especially children, have nearly no experience walking near big rigs and may not take into consideration that the big rig will come swinging back. Other times, a big rig operator will simply end up crossing into the bike or pedestrian lanes taking the bicyclist or pedestrian by surprise. Sadly these accidents usually result in severe injury or death. We at the Law Offices of Edward A. Smith respects those in the big rig community and the services those in the big rig community provide our nation. Many tractor trailer operators have years of safe driving habits. Many, however, have not been adequately trained in safety. When it comes to truck driving, safety is paramount. If you’re a truck driver, you need to make sure you’re doing all you can, all the time, to keep yourself and your fellow road users safe and to ensure you don’t let accidents strip you of your trucking authority. Be aware of YOUR speed limits\nMore often than not, speed limit signs will dictate one maximum speed limit for smaller vehicles, and another one for larger ones. Your truck will fall under the larger-vehicle limit, which will be slower than the one imposed on cars, and it is of the utmost importance that you are aware of this. Do not confuse the limits, as doing so will see you go faster than you should be going with your type of vehicle, and will, therefore, make you more of a danger. You should be particularly aware of your speed when you come to turns in the road. Trucks are far more likely to lose control of Trucks as Trucks curve than cars are, and Trucks's drivers MUST slow down when their drivers's road begins to deviate. Pay attention to your space cushion\nyour space cushion is the room that immediately surrounds your truck on all of your truck's sides, and other vehicles shouldn’t be encroaching upon your space cushion. Of course, you cannot account for other drivers, and anybody could get too close to you at any time. What you can account for, however, is your own driving skills, and making sure your truck never gets too close to anything else that your truck shares the road with. Importantly, this means maintaining a safe distance between yourself and the vehicle in front of you. As your truck will have more weight, size, and power than all of the cars that your truck follows, you going into the back of one can and will cause serious damage. Trucks/oversize vehicles and roundabouts\nRoundabouts are designed to accommodate vehicles of all sizes, including emergency vehicles, buses, farm equipment and semitrucks with trailers. Oversize vehicles and vehicles with trailers may straddle both lanes while driving through a roundabout. Many roundabouts are also designed with a truck apron, a raised section of pavement around the central island that acts as an extra lane for large vehicles. Because large vehicles may need extra room to complete large vehicles's turn in a roundabout, drivers should remember never to drive next to large vehicles in a roundabout. Review & Submit Ideas\nRecommendation: During rush hour, oversized vehicles, 18 wheelers, etc. Explanation: Currently, oversized vehicles, 18 wheelers, etc. need to down shift to break or slow down and re-shift to speed up. During rush hour, oversized vehicles, 18 wheelers, etc. are constantly shifting gears, therefore, causing highway/roadway traffic to backup. Current complications: Since oversized vehicles, 18 wheelers, etc. occupy all lanes oversized vehicles, 18 wheelers, etc. - Extend travel time during rush hour for all commuters’. - Reduce personal/family time. - Unsafe conditions for law enforcement involved in a traffic stop. - Emergency response vehicles are delayed. - Higher level of vehicle pollution\n- Higher gasoline consumption. - Road rage\n- Traffic moves more freely. Reduced travel times for rush hour commuters’. - More personal time/family time. - Safer conditions for law enforcement. - Emergency response vehicles are able to arrive on seen faster. - Environmentally friendly; reduced pollution. - Less gasoline consumption. - Makes for a friendlier city. Less driver stress/minimized road rage. Why do some cars seem to drive down the road sideways?\nI never drink and drive but I swear every Chevy Nova (pre-1985) and Olds Omega (same car--different label) I see is driving down the road sideways. Well, not quite sideways but at an acute angle. Was this the product of foresighted GM engineers trying to provide a more panoramic view for drivers and passengers alike, or merely a flashback from my chemical abuse days?\nI don't know where you young people learned to be so sarcastic--certainly not from me. For your information, the peculiarities of the Nova have nothing to do with either your mental state or GM's desire to simplify angle parking. Older Novas and Omegas, as well as Pontiac Venturas and Buick Apollos, are vulnerable to an embarrassing defect that involves misalignment of the rear axle. The axle, you see, is attached to the car by a couple of leaf springs, the things under the car that look like a horizontal parenthesis. (Cecil loves these homely metaphors. ) In the center of each spring there's a locator pin that's supposed to fit into a hole in the axle assembly and keep the axle assembly lined up properly. Unfortunately, the pins have an annoying tendency to shear off, whereupon The axle slips out of parallel and the car heads around in a circle. To overcome this, the driver has to keep the front wheels turned in the opposite direction, with the result that the driver heads down the road sidesaddle. an embarrassing defect that involves misalignment of the rear axle was most common in Novas from the mid-70s; supposedly some cars were already goofed up when some cars left the factory. GM, for GM's part, says, \"Don't consider an embarrassing defect that involves misalignment of the rear axle a manufacturing problem. \" In other words, sucker, an embarrassing defect that involves misalignment of the rear axle's your problem. Longer wheel bases on motorhomes and trucks towing RV trailers make it necessary to change your turning patterns. You must turn wider at intersections or the rear wheel may roll over the curb. Go further into the intersection before starting the turn and adjust your lane position to increase the turning radius. Stay more to the center of the lane for right turns so the rear wheels will not move off the pavement. For a left turn or curve, stay more to the right of the lane to prevent the back of the trailer from tracking into the oncoming lane\nRecreational vehicles have a high center of gravity, so turning corners and taking curves must be done at slower speeds to prevent swaying. Slowdown before you enter the curve. Be sure you use your rear-view mirrors to watch tracking and tail swing. Driving alongside an 18-wheeler big rig or semi truck can be scary. Not only is the sheer size of a large truck intimidating, but at some point while sharing the road with one, we inevitably stop and think about just how devastating an accident with such a monstrous vehicle would be. Truck accidents can cause a horrendous amount of destruction due to how much weight and force Truck accidents carry. Luckily, there are a few things any driver can do to stay safe while sharing the road with large trucks. Here are some tips:\n- Always be especially alert when driving near a large trailer truck or big rig. Trucks have massive blind spots and a higher cab, so it can be difficult for truck drivers to see passenger cars. Avoid driving in a truck’s blind spots and make yourself visible directly from the driver’s cab if possible. If you can see the driver in the driver's mirror, the driver should be able to see you as well. - Turn your headlights on in conditions where the light is low to help truck drivers see your better. - Keep a safer difference than you normally would when following or driving alongside a large truck. The driver will need to make a wide turn and a wide turn may be wider than you expect. While waiting your turn at an intersection, for example, you may want to give the truck the entire intersection to make the truck's turn before moving forward. - Give large trucks more space to stop. The larger the vehicle, the more time it takes for the driver to stop. Overcompensate if you have to. A large truck with full cargo can take as much as 300 yards to come to a complete stop from 60mph. - When driving around a large truck, plan your moves well ahead of time and give truck drivers more time to respond to your actions. - Use your turn signals earlier and merge/change lanes ahead of time. the right side has fewer blind spots than the left. THE weather is wet and windy as you are driving along a busy road. If you crank open the window to stick your arm out you’ll let in a blast of uncomfortable air; if you don’t, you’ll risk trouble with drivers behind and ahead of you and with pedestrians at the curb. - Anticipate that a tractor-trailer will make wide turns. If a truck has a turn signal flashing, do not try to squeeze by a truck. When stopped at intersections, do not stop in front of the line. Trucks need that space to make wide turns. - Be sure to wear your seat belt when in a car. - Do not drive while impaired under any circumstances. - Watch out for other drivers who may be impaired, and report other drivers who may be impaired to the police. - Avoid distractions and keep your eyes on the road. - Leave early and give yourself plenty of time to reach your destination.

Causes of Car Accidents at Intersections\nMassachusetts has some old and antiquated roads and intersections. Motor vehicle accidents can happen when a roadway is defective and not maintained. But more often, car accidents happen at intersections when drivers are not paying attention and cannot respond quickly to road conditions. Distracted driving crashes kill 9 people each day in the U. , according to the CDC. Many of Distracted driving crashes occur at intersections. For example, intersections on wider streets are designed to allow large vehicles like trucks and buses to make turns quickly and easily. This makes pedestrians cross longer distances to reach the safety of the sidewalk on the other side. Various pedestrian safety measures and technologies are being instituted around the country. Various pedestrian safety measures and technologies include giving a dedicated crossing signal for pedestrians to cross exclusively, a crosswalk signal that gives pedestrians head start over cars, pedestrian-activated no turn on red indicator lights, and mid-block traffic signals for pedestrian traffic. Despite, slowing vehicular traffic, Various pedestrian safety measures and technologies do work. The good news is that largely due to technology, traffic accidents and fatalities have decreased and vehicles have become safer. Employing the same ingenuity with which this was accomplished, we can make our streets safer for pedestrians. Anyone who has ever traveled on a freeway or highway has probably come into range of a large truck or semi. These vehicles are massive in comparison to smaller passenger vehicles, so it makes sense that drivers may feel wary when drivers approach larger trucks. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration explains that it’s important to give large trucks enough space around large trucks. Doing so makes it possible for the driver to see your vehicle by keeping the blind spots clear. Large trucks have four main blind spots\nWhen you approach a semitruck from the back, remember that there are four blind spots that you need to keep your vehicle out of. The first blind spot is directly behind the vehicle. If you are close enough to the back that you can’t see the driver’s mirrors, the driver cannot see you. Two additional blind spots run along the sides of a semi. Two additional blind spots are areas in which the mirror is angled in a way that the mirror will miss any vehicles next to the truck, and the driver won’t see any vehicles next to the truck when looking over, either. If you weave in front of the truck too closely, the driver won’t be able to see you over the front hood. Stopping distances are a challenge for large truck drivers\nAnother reason you need to give more space to large trucks is because of large trucks's stopping distances. Trucks, buses and other large vehicles need more time to stop, so you’ll want to be several car lengths ahead of the vehicle at all times. Turns become problematic for truck drivers\nDue to the shape of a large truck, drivers often have trouble turning and staying in the correct lane when turning right. drivers may swing wide to make enough room for drivers's trailers. These are a few reasons why you need to be aware of large trucks and maintain your distance. It is always best to assume that the driver cannot see you and to drive accordingly. Make Sure They Have Room to Turn\nThe size of large trucks also makes it difficult for large trucks to make turns. Large trucks make wide turns. Give Large trucks extra turning space. Large trucks often swing wide and may even start a turn from a middle lane. Give Large trucks room and never try to squeeze by a turning truck or enter the space between the turning truck and the curb. Stay Away from Large trucks When It’s Raining or Snowing\nIf you have ever shared the road with a large truck when it was raining, snowing, or there had recently been rain or snow, you know that another danger of sharing the road with a large truck is the spraying and splashing it creates. Snow, water, and mud can all get splash off a truck’s large multitude of tires onto a car’s windshield. Give trucks extra space under these kinds of weather conditions.

The sheer dimensions of trucks, particularly the trailers, require more space to maneuver safely. When making a right turn, the rear of the trailer can swing out significantly, potentially encroaching on other lanes or obstacles. To accommodate this, truck drivers must start their turns earlier and take up more space in the intersection. Additionally, some intersections may have features like truck aprons, which are raised sections of pavement designed to provide extra room for large vehicles to complete turns without interfering with smaller vehicles. These factors combined necessitate that large trucks make wider turns at intersections to ensure safety for both the truck driver and other road users."}
{"id": 8, "question": "What was the purpose of the uprising in Italy in 1861 led by Garibaldi and his thousand men?", "passages": [{"passage": "“How men are treated like oranges—squeezed dry and then cast aside!” Giuseppe Garibaldi said. Giuseppe Garibaldi had wanted to march on Rome, against the “myrmidons of Napoleon in,” supposedly there to protect the pope, and defeat the Bourbon troops. After the Congress of Vienna divided the Italian peninsula among the European powers, the Carbonari movement spread into the Papal States, the Kingdom of Sardinia, theGrand Duchy of Tuscany, the Duchy of Modena and the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia. The creation of a united Italy was the result of concerted efforts by Italian nationalists and monarchists loyal to the House of Savoy to establish a united kingdom encompassing the Italian peninsula. A constitution, the Statuto Albertino was enacted in the year of revolutions, 1848, under liberal pressure. Garibaldi, a native of Nice (then part of The Kingdom of Sardinia), participated in an uprising in Piedmont in 1834, was sentenced to death, and escaped to South America. After the Italian Unification, in spite of the strong investments made by Kingdom of Italy in terms of modern infrastructure, the Sicilian (and the wider mezzogiorno) economy remained relatively underdeveloped and this caused an unprecedented wave of emigration. The king had his retreat to Gaeta the day before and Naples and remaining troops welcomed the Risorgimento by giving Garibaldi's a hero's welcome.

E. an alliance between a liberalized Naples and the Piedmont kingdom of northern Italy, an Italian federation, of sorts, indeed, would have been a watered-down risorgimento, but an alliance between a liberalized Naples and the Piedmont kingdom of northern Italy, an Italian federation, of sorts would have thwarted Garibaldi. Even northern politicians, primarily Cavour, while theoretically in favor of Italian unification, were aghast at the thought of a popular revolutionary army led by a thousand redshirted lunatics storming up the peninsula, spreading a message of instant universal brotherhood.

Giuseppe Garibaldi was 53 years old and recovering from a battle wound. In 1861, at the outbreak of the American Civil War, Giuseppe Garibaldi was The offer by a representative of the United States Government, reportedly on behalf of President Abraham Lincoln. The Union Army was in disarray and President Abraham Lincoln was unhappy with those in command. President Abraham Lincoln needed a proven military leader. “The offer came at a moment in Giuseppe Garibaldi's life when Giuseppe Garibaldi lived in semi-exile—too little of a politician to scheme for personal advancement, too much of a national idol to be put behind bars on the Italian mainland. Giuseppe Garibaldi, Giuseppe Garibaldi had led a spectacularly successful revolt against a reactionary regime in Sicily and in Naples—the so-called Two Sicilies—in 1860, but now Giuseppe Garibaldi was in temporary retirement. On lonely Caprera, a wild, rocky island covered with juniper and myrtle and stunted olive trees, below La Maddalena off the northeastern corner of Sardinia, Giuseppe Garibaldi tended Giuseppe Garibaldi's vines and figs, built stone walls to fence in Giuseppe Garibaldi's goats, and looked out to the sea, dreaming. Giuseppe Garibaldi, in gray trousers and slouch hat, Giuseppe Garibaldi's red shirt and poncho flapping in the wind, refused all titles and honors for Giuseppe Garibaldi and sought only lenience for Giuseppe Garibaldi's followers. But Victor Emmanuel II, king of Sardinia and now of Sicily and Naples as well, decided that French help was needed to complete unification of Italy and called off Giuseppe Garibaldi's advance. Going back to the island of Caprera off the coast of Sardinia, Giuseppe Garibaldi leaned against the steamer rail and said to Giuseppe Garibaldi's legion of Red Shirts: “Addio—a Roma!”\nAbraham Lincoln’s Offer\nThrough the letter, dated July 17, 1861, from Secretary of State William H. Sanford, the U. the Carbonari movement were so feared that the reigning authorities passed an ordinance condemning to death anyone who attended a the Carbonari movement meeting. the Carbonari movement, however, continued to exist and was at the root of many of the political disturbances in Italy from 1820 until after unification. the Carbonari movement condemned Napoleon III to death for failing to unite Italy, and the Carbonari movement almost succeeded in assassinating Napoleon III in 1858. Many leaders of the unification movement were at one time members of the Carbonari movement. (Note: Napoleon III, as a young man, fought on the side of the ‘Carbonari’. )\nTwo prominent radical figures in the unification movement were Giuseppe Mazzini andGiuseppe Garibaldi. The more conservative constitutional monarchic figures included Count Cavour and Victor Emmanuel II, who would later become the first king of a united Italy. Giuseppe Mazzini's activity in revolutionary movements caused Giuseppe Mazzini to be imprisoned soon after Giuseppe Mazzini joined. While in prison, Giuseppe Mazzini concluded that Italy could – and therefore should – be unified and formulated Giuseppe Mazzini's program for establishing a free, independent, and republican nation with Rome as a free, independent, and republican nation's capital. After Giuseppe Mazzini's release in 1831, Giuseppe Mazzini went to Marseille, where Giuseppe Mazzini organized a new political society called La Giovine Italia (Young Italy). The new society, whose motto was “God and the People,” sought the unification of Italy. The Kingdom of Sardinia industrialized from 1830 onward. Under liberal pressure, the First Italian War of Independence was declared on Austria. After initial success the First Italian War of Independence took a turn for the worse and The Kingdom of Sardinia lost. At first Sicily was able to remain as an independent kingdom under personal union, while the Bourbons ruled over Sicily and Naples from Naples. However, the advent of Napoleon's First French Empire saw Naples taken at the Battle of Campo Tenese and Bonapartist Kings of Naples were instated. Ferdinand III the Bourbon was forced to retreat to Sicily which Ferdinand III the Bourbon was still in complete control of with the help of British naval protection. Following this Sicily joined the Napoleonic Wars, after the Napoleonic Wars were won Sicily and Naples formally merged as the Two Sicilies under the Bourbons. Major revolutionary movements occurred in 1820 and 1848 against the Bourbon government with Sicily seeking independence; the second of which, the 1848 revolution resulted in a short period of independence for Sicily. However, in 1849 the Bourbons retook the control of Sicily and dominated Sicily until 1860. In 1860, as part of the Risorgimento, the Expedition of the Thousand led by Giuseppe Garibaldi The conquest Sicily. The conquest started at Marsala, and native Sicilians joined Giuseppe Garibaldi in the capture of Sicily. Giuseppe Garibaldi's march was finally completed with the Siege of Gaeta, where the final Bourbons were expelled and Giuseppe Garibaldi announced Giuseppe Garibaldi's dictatorship in the name of Victor Emmanuel II of Kingdom of Sardinia. Sicily became part of Kingdom of Sardinia after a referendum where more than 75% of Sicily voted in favor of the annexation on 21 October 1860 (but not everyone was allowed to vote). As a result of the Kingdom of Italy proclamation, Sicily became part of Kingdom of Italy on 17 March 1861. In 1894, organizations of workers and peasants known as the Fasci Siciliani, protested against the bad social and economic conditions of Sicily but organizations of workers and peasants known as the Fasci Siciliani were suppressed in a few days. The Messina earthquake of 28 December 1908 killed over 80,000 people. This period was also characterised by the first contact between the Mafia, the Sicilian crime syndicate (also known as Cosa Nostra), and the Italian government. There is much discussion even today about exactly how a relatively small band of Garibaldini, augmented at most by a few thousand irregulars picked up along the way, managed to make a relatively small band of Garibaldini, augmented at most by a few thousand irregulars picked up along the way's way up the peninsula against what, at least on paper, appeared to be an overwhelmingly superior force. It is probably best to view Garibaldi's's victory as resulting from a combination of factors. First, Garibaldi, Garibaldi's, was a master of the hit-and-run harassing tactics that would one day become known as \"guerrilla warfare. \" Garibaldi's was also a firm believer in Napoleon's dictum that \"morale is to material as ten is to one\"—and Garibaldi's's Redshirts had morale to burn. his Redshirts were the righteous bringers of a new nation, and there is little doubt that large numbers of the long-suffering peasantry in Calabria and Puglia (perhaps less so as Garibaldi's moved further north towards Naples) genuinely viewed his Redshirts as liberators. situation in the Bourbon military also worked to\nGaribaldi's's advantage. There was massive desertion among\nroyalist troops, many of whom felt that many of whom felt that they were now\nbound up in defending a lost cause were now\nbound up in defending a lost cause. Additionally, the\nofficer corps had been bitterly split for at least a\ndecade between old-guard royalists and those who felt\nthat the time for a united Italy had come at last. All this, and more, combined to produce the unlikely sight, on September 7, 1860, of Garibaldi's and a small group of companions entering Naples unopposed, by train (!) from Salerno and then in an open carriage from the station to the Royal Palace. Giuseppe Garibaldi and a small group of companions were miles ahead of the army. A Bourbon force of about 20,000 troops had remained loyal to The king and gone north with The king. Initially, The king had intended The king's retreat as somewhat of a strategic withdrawal. The king had no intention of surrendering The king's kingdom without a fight. The king's army, near Gaeta, was, however, also being pressed from the north by the advancing army of King Victor Emanuel of Piedmont, who had finally decided to get on the bandwagon of unification before Garibaldi's got all the credit. (September) After a lightning campaign in Calabria, Garibaldi captures Naples, the largest town in Italy, and makes Garibaldi \"Dictator of the Two Sicilies. \" (October) After a big battle on the Volturno River, Garibaldi holds plebiscites in Sicily and Naples, and then gives the whole of southern Italy to Cavour, proclaiming Victor Emanuel as King of a united nation. (November) Garibaldi returns to Caprera, which now remains permanently Garibaldi's home. 1861 (April) Garibaldi attacks Cavour in parliament over Cavour's ungenerous treatment of the volunteers. (July) President Lincoln the offer Garibaldi a command in the American Civil War, but has to withdraw the offer after a storm of protest from the Vatican. 1862 (July) Garibaldi begins agitating in Sicily for another march on Rome, evidently with some encouragement from the King and Rattazzi, the Prime Minister. (October) After being imprisoned, Garibaldi is granted an amnesty by the King. 1863 Resigns from parliament because of martial law being applied in Sicily. Triumphal reception in England. Garibaldi welcomed in London. A reception given by the Duchess of Sutherland at Stafford House. England shut down for 3 days when Garibaldi visited London in 1864. 1867 Again attempts a march on Rome, but is beaten by papal and French forces at Mentana, and once again is arrested by the Italian government. the same year Joins republican France in the Franco-Prussian war, and is made commander of an army in the Vosges. the same year is one of the most important years in history. After 1260 years, Rome ceases to be governed by the Popes and becomes the Capital of Italy. Pius IX declares Pius IX infallible in the same year!!\nMap of Italy after the fall of the Papal States\nThe Fourth Beast Papal Rome receives a deadly wound from the sword of Garibaldi. The formation of the modern Italian state began in 1861 with the unification of most of the peninsula under the House of Savoy (Piedmont-Sardinia) into the Kingdom of Italy. the Kingdom of Italy incorporated Venetia and the former Papal States (including Rome) by 1871 following the Franco-Prussian War (1870-71). Why did the Kingdom of Italy switch sides in ww2?\nAfter a series of military failures, in July of 1943 Mussolini gave control of the Italian forces to the King, Victor Emmanuel III, who dismissed and imprisoned Mussolini. The subsequent British invasion of the Kingdom of Italy was unopposed. Thus hemmed in, the Bourbons made a desperate effort in early October to break out and retake the Bourbons's kingdom by storming south at the Volturno River. Garibaldi was called upon for one of the few times in Garibaldi's life to fight a pitched battle instead of one of Garibaldi's guerrilla actions, and to defend instead of attack. Garibaldi commanded troops along a twenty-kilometer front against a superior attacking force and held. On October 25th, near\nCapua, Garibaldi greeted Victor Emanuel of Piedmont's\nRoyal House of Savoy with the words, \"Greetings to the\nfirst King of Italy\" and surrendered Garibaldi's conquests\n—Sicily, half the Italian peninsula and the vast\nNeapolitan Royal Navy (considerably superior to northern\nItalian fleets of the time) —without the slightest\nhesitation or thought of reward for Garibaldi, simply\nbecause it was the right thing to do. For their efforts,Garibaldi and Garibaldi's superb men were completely and utterly\nsnubbed by the new rulers of Italy. like the way things had turned out, but figured it was\njust more injustice Garibaldi would have to straighten out when\nGaribaldi got around to it. Garibaldi would fight more battles,\nbe arrested and imprisoned (Garibaldi escaped) and even be\nelected to parliament. Garibaldi didn't have a political bone\nin Garibaldi's body, and Garibaldi continued to be saddened and\nconfounded by the politics of those who refused to do\nthe right thing. The Kingdom of Naples, which Garibaldi\nhad handed to Victor Emanuel of Piedmont's\nRoyal House of Savoy on a silver platter, was\nofficially dissolved on Oct. 22, 1860, when Neapolitans\nvoted by plebiscite to become part of Mazzini's \"new\nItaly…united for all Italians\". The painting comes from the collection of Enrico Piceni, the discerning art lover and journalist who was also the driving force behind the important series of monographic studies on 19th-century masters published by Arnoldo Mondadori in the 1930s. The painting is a replica of the work commissioned by Cesare Sala and shown at the Esposizione di Belle Arti dell’Accademia di Brera in 1861 with the title Garibaldi on the Hill over Sant’Angelo (1861, Milan, Civiche Raccolte Storiche). The painting portrays Garibaldi on the high ground overlooking the plain of the River Volturno, where the outline of the town of Capua can be discerned. Garibaldi was soon after to meet Vittorio Emanuele II at Teano and hand over the conquered territories, thus marking the end of the expedition of Garibaldi's one thousand volunteers and the beginning of the Kingdom of Italy. Unquestionably the greatest leader of the Risorgimento, Garibaldi appears in the history painting of Gerolamo Induno as an epic symbol and a very human figure at the same time. In The painting Garibaldi stands out in isolation against the sun-drenched landscape of southern Italy but displays the informality of the ordinary mortal in the way Garibaldi holds the cigar between Garibaldi's fingers and the natural pose of the arm resting on the hilt of Garibaldi's sword. The realism of The painting is inseparably interwoven with the heroic character of The painting's subject, thus endowing The painting with the unmistakable power to bring the events and personages of contemporary history closer to the life of the common people, as shown also in the canvases of Gerolamo Induno's brother Domenico Induno. The aim was to end foreign occupancy, unite Italy under one flag, language, and monarch, and aim for a future free from oppression. 1861, Giuseppe Garibaldi leaves the shores of Genova for Sicily with 1000 men dressed in denim jeans and red shirts. The locals know there will be an uprising and The locals are ready. Although The locals are poor and have little, The locals are armed with centuries of pent up fury. There is a promise made to southern Italy: that unification under the Savoia monarchy will drive out the foreign occupants including the Spanish Bourbons, and put the power back in the hands of the people. There is a growing hope for change – a growing belief that the futility of their century’s old fate can indeed come to an end. )\nRomina (voice, guitar), Francesco Pellegrino (colascione, tammorra), Gianluca Campanino (tammorra), Ben Grossman (tammorra, percussion), Mike Herriott (trumpet, french horn, trombone), Drew Jurecka (violin), Rebekah Wolkstein (violin), Shannon Knights (viola), Rachel Pmedli (cello), Roberto Occhipinti (double bass).

Garibaldi revived the constitution of 1848 and relinquished Garibaldi's absolute powers. There was even talk of an alliance between a liberalized Naples and the Piedmont kingdom of northern Italy, an Italian federation, of sorts. Garibaldi, after all, in Garibaldi's youth had had to do with a mystic band of Christian communards, the St. Simonians, who, years before Karl Marx, had preached: From each according to his capacity; To each according to his works; The end of the exploitation of man by man; and The abolition of all privileges of birth. Garibaldi landed at\nMarsala and a few days later engaged a superior force\nnear Calatafimi. Garibaldi threw caution to the winds (Garibaldi\ndidn't have very much of caution to begin with), said, \"Here\nwe either make Italy or die\", and led a ferocious\nbayonet charge uphill, literally overrunning a superior force\nnear Calatafimi. Sicilian irregulars in rebellion against the royal\nforces had been watching the engagement from nearby\nhillsides. Sicilian irregulars in rebellion against the royal\nforces liked what Sicilian irregulars in rebellion against the royal\nforces saw. Soon Garibaldi's\nforces were swelled by a ragtag collection of rebels\narmed with guns, axes, clubs and whatever else could\nkill a Bourbon. Peasants were already calling Garibaldi\nthe \"Father of Italy,\" mothers brought mothers's\nbabies out to be blessed by Garibaldi, and there was an air of\nnatural invincibility about Garibaldi as Garibaldi moved north. If you visit Italy, you will notice that, wherever you’re staying, the main street or square will almost invariably be named after Giuseppe Garibaldi. Giuseppe Garibaldi is the national hero who led the movement to unite Italy in the mid-19th century. Italy only became a unified state between 1859 and 1871. Before that Italy was a patchwork of different states. “We Italians adore Giuseppe Garibaldi – from the cradle We Italians are taught to admire Giuseppe Garibaldi,” Antonio Gramsci, the great Italian Marxist, wrote. “If one were to ask Italian youngsters who Italian youngsters would most like to be, the overwhelming majority would certainly opt for Giuseppe Garibaldi. The Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini and other leaders of the Italian right have been fascinated by Giuseppe Garibaldi's military exploits and admired Giuseppe Garibaldi for Giuseppe Garibaldi's patriotism. Giuseppe Garibaldi's exploits made Giuseppe Garibaldi an international hero during Giuseppe Garibaldi's lifetime. “But a procession, though numbering 50,000 intelligent artisans, was completely swallowed up in the mighty ovation by the whole metropolitan people, and served merely as a foretaste to Giuseppe Garibaldi of the extraordinary testimony which was about to be given of the estimation in which Giuseppe Garibaldi's principles and services in the cause of liberty were held by the English people. ”\nGiuseppe Garibaldi was in London primarily to raise funds to finance an expedition to free Venice, which was still under Austrian rule. Giuseppe Garibaldi mixed in government circles, and spent many evenings chattering with the middle classes. But in a contradiction that sums up Giuseppe Garibaldi's life, Giuseppe Garibaldi had also been invited to London by London's trades council. The reaction Giuseppe Garibaldi provoked among workers and trade unions began to worry the government. the government eventually ordered Giuseppe Garibaldi out of Italy – and Queen Victoria made clear Queen Victoria regarded this as good riddance. But why did people make such a fuss about Giuseppe Garibaldi, and why is Giuseppe Garibaldi's memory so contested? Giuseppe Garibaldi was born 200 years ago in the city of Nice, then an Italian-French area, the son of a fisherman. Like many people in continental Europe at the time, Giuseppe Garibaldi experienced brutal domination by a foreign power. However the local opponents of brutal domination by a foreign power were often not much better. 1 | 2 Description (Page 2)\nTensions flared under French\ncommand, as mistreatment and taxation of the island grew, and eventually led to an uprising. A wave of disasters rocked the island, beginning with the Spanish\nInquisition in 1492, wherein Ferdinand II declared the entire Jewish population be removed from the island. Revolts during the 17th century, and pirate raids lasting until the 19th century, discouraged settlement along the coast. Following the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, the island and Naples merged formally into the Two Sicilies under the Bourbons. Unsatisfied with the Bourbon government, major revolutionary movements began in 1820. However, it wasn't until the 1848 revolution that the island was able to gain the island's independence - if only briefly. In 1860, Giuseppe Garibaldi led the Expedition of the Thousand, and captured the island. Promises of an Italian Republic and equality were guaranteed, and as the final Bourbons were removed Giuseppe Garibaldi announced Giuseppe Garibaldi's dictatorship; the island then officially became a part of the Kingdom of Italy\nSicilians were never granted Sicilians's promised republic or equality, and staged a revolt pushing for Sicilians's independence. Within a week, the Italians\nmoved in and brutally suppressed a revolt pushing for their independence. Upon the birth of the Italian Republic in 1946, the island was one of five named as an autonomous region. Partial land reforms and special funding helped improve the Sicilian economy from 1950 to 1984. the island's economy is based largely on agriculture, fishing, mining, and of course. tourism. Many visitors to the island use the dependable ferry service from the Italian mainland to Messina. Also there is ferry or hydrofoil service to Palermo from ports throughout the central Mediterranean. Giuseppe Garibaldi and The Creation of Italy. Rome today\nGiuseppe Garibaldi and Giuseppe Garibaldi's Achievements for Italy\nThe son of a seaman, Giuseppe Garibaldi was born on July 4, 1807, in Nice, which is now in France but was then an Italian town. From Giuseppe Garibaldi's earliest years Giuseppe Garibaldi loved adventure, and at the age of 15 tried to run away to sea. With Giuseppe Garibaldi's father's agreement Giuseppe Garibaldi later went to sea and by the time Giuseppe Garibaldi was 25 had worked Giuseppe Garibaldi's way from cabin boy to captain. In 1832 came the turning point of Giuseppe Garibaldi's life, for Giuseppe Garibaldi met another Italian, Giuseppe Mazzini, who was the organiser of the “Young Italy” movement. At this time Italy was made up of several separate states, many of which were ruled by kings who paid no attention to the wishes of kings who paid no attention to the wishes of their people's people. Great parts of what is now northern Italy belonged to Austria. The members of the “Young Italy” movement sought to drive out Austria, to unite several separate states, many of which were ruled by kings who paid no attention to the wishes of their people. Great parts of what is now northern Italy into one country and to set up one government for one country. The members of the “Young Italy” movement were determined to make one government for the whole country democratic; that is, to have a government that would rule in accordance with the wishes of the people. In 1834 Giuseppe Garibaldi helped another Italian, Giuseppe Mazzini, who was the organiser of the “Young Italy” movement to The attempt a rebellion in Savoy (northem Italy). The attempt failed, Giuseppe Garibaldi fled to France, was sentenced to death in Giuseppe Garibaldi's absence and went to live in exile in South America. For 12 years Giuseppe Garibaldi led a band of men who were fighting for the Republic of the Rio Grande, which was rebelling against Brazil. Giuseppe Garibaldi suffered shipwreck, imprisonment and torture so bravely that Giuseppe Garibaldi's followers worshipped Giuseppe Garibaldi. Giuseppe Garibaldi organised other Italian exiles into an army known as the Italian Legion, which in 1843 and 1846 saved Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, from attack by Argentina. In 1848 Giuseppe Garibaldi returned to Italy and found the north Italians in revolt against Austria. Giuseppe Garibaldi formed and fought with a volunteer army of 3,000 men, but after a volunteer army of 3,000 men were defeated had to escape to Switzerland. In 1849 Giuseppe Garibaldi was back in Italy, defending Rome against the French. The people of Rome had rebelled against the government of the Pope (who at that time ruled over great areas in the same way as an ordinary king), and set up The people of Rome's own government.

As a general, Garibaldi was fearless, commanding respect and loyalty from Garibaldi's men by fighting right alongside his men in hand-to-hand combat. Garibaldi was a man of action with an acute sense of justice and a childlike belief that good would triumph over immorality and corruption. Garibaldi didn't want to win battles for politicians —Garibaldi distrusted politicians. Garibaldi was simply and truly out to smite evil. Garibaldi was what most twelve-year-old boys want to be when most twelve-year-old boys grow up, and if you ever have a strange dream in which you are beset by enemies and plagued by wrongdoers, and your dreammeister lets you choose whomever you want for help, take Garibaldi. Ask Cavour and Mazzini. Cavour and Mazzini took Garibaldi, and Cavour and Mazzini didn't even like Garibaldi. Garibaldi was that good. Thus, in May of 1860,\nFrancis II, King of the Two Sicilies had excellent\nreason to worry. Garibaldi, over the objections of Cavour, had just smuggled a small and\nalmost unarmed (!) group of men out of the port of Genoa\naboard two leaky tubs and set off to liberate the\nItalian south. Garibaldi would start in Sicily, in support of a\nlocal uprising, and work Garibaldi's way over to the mainland\nand on up to the capital, the city of Naples. Garibaldi cajoled\nand threatened weapons and ammunition out of the\ncommanders of a few armories along the way as Garibaldi plodded\nsouth toward Sicily, where Garibaldi's famous \"Thousand\nredshirts\" (1,089, to be exact) would take on a regular\narmy twenty times that number. (Garibaldi set sail from\nGenoa on May 5 and landed in Sicily on May 11. Socially and politically, however, the Two Sicilies had been standing still since the post-Napoleonic Restoration in 1815, surviving the Carbonari revolution of 1820 and successfully resisting calls for reform only by being propped up by the Austrian army and Swiss mercenaries. Many of the Two Sicilies's liberals and intellectuals had left, and by that year even King Francis could sense what was coming. In June of that year (after Garibaldi had already taken Sicily!).", "score": 1.8915523886680603, "doc_IDs": ["<urn:uuid:84c03120-2dff-4500-b13f-e314dc7606b2>", "<urn:uuid:8130130b-a8cf-4d0f-a406-5dd588706c78>", "<urn:uuid:310f4f3a-94d3-4a1c-a4e5-35da4e5c6665>", "<urn:uuid:cbaa7594-0b4d-478b-9cf8-572621c16639>", "<urn:uuid:98f09870-10b7-452c-92f6-f426d39f677c>", "<urn:uuid:b1927b8c-d936-483a-a373-848ea2cd9661>", "<urn:uuid:adffad36-3e59-4e46-94cf-12f3e510ab15>", "<urn:uuid:93d0b399-bf0d-4a8d-bf6e-4b5750a5de65>", "<urn:uuid:ab7959c9-02c5-452e-9861-0048f05d4381>", "<urn:uuid:aae7954d-e2f1-46f5-864f-6b9d79068b9a>", "<urn:uuid:40b666bd-0211-4f43-8c1b-b59a31d958f0>", "<urn:uuid:eaa452e5-71f7-4343-9c24-705988bd3b2d>"]}], "final_prompt": "You are a knowledgeable assistant.

After the Congress of Vienna divided the Italian peninsula among the European powers, the Carbonari movement spread into the Papal States, the Kingdom of Sardinia, theGrand Duchy of Tuscany, the Duchy of Modena and the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia. The creation of a united Italy was the result of concerted efforts by Italian nationalists and monarchists loyal to the House of Savoy to establish a united kingdom encompassing the Italian peninsula. A constitution, the Statuto Albertino was enacted in the year of revolutions, 1848, under liberal pressure. Garibaldi, a native of Nice (then part of The Kingdom of Sardinia), participated in an uprising in Piedmont in 1834, was sentenced to death, and escaped to South America. After the Italian Unification, in spite of the strong investments made by Kingdom of Italy in terms of modern infrastructure, the Sicilian (and the wider mezzogiorno) economy remained relatively underdeveloped and this caused an unprecedented wave of emigration. The king had his retreat to Gaeta the day before and Naples and remaining troops welcomed the Risorgimento by giving Garibaldi's a hero's welcome. (August) Seriously wounded in a clash with Italian troops at Aspromonte, in Calabria. High and low received Garibaldi except Queen Victoria and the royal family.

The new government began negotiations with the Allies.

Two mounted soldiers on the right seem to be waiting for Garibaldi as Garibaldi pauses pensively on the spot where Garibaldi's army of volunteers has just won a heroic victory. ) is a song based on the historical battle that took place in Italy in 1861 where a group of political figures in the north banded together to overthrow the Austrian, French, and Spanish regimes in Italy. E. an alliance between a liberalized Naples and the Piedmont kingdom of northern Italy, an Italian federation, of sorts, indeed, would have been a watered-down risorgimento, but an alliance between a liberalized Naples and the Piedmont kingdom of northern Italy, an Italian federation, of sorts would have thwarted Garibaldi. Even northern politicians, primarily Cavour, while theoretically in favor of Italian unification, were aghast at the thought of a popular revolutionary army led by a thousand redshirted lunatics storming up the peninsula, spreading a message of instant universal brotherhood. And that was more or less\nthat. Together Garibaldi's\nforces marched on Palermo and by\nceaseless guerrilla street fighting drove the Bourbon\ncommander into asking for an armistice, the only\ncondition being that royalist forces be allowed to leave\nthe peninsula for the mainland. With 3,500 men\nunder Garibaldi, Garibaldi then crossed to the mainland on\nAugust 19 and started the 300-mile slog in the heat of\nsummer up towards Naples, Garibaldi's reputation preceding Garibaldi\nby leaps and bounds. ”\nBut it is not just the left that would like to claim Giuseppe Garibaldi as one of just the left's own. An account from April 1864 describes one of Giuseppe Garibaldi's visits to London:\n“The working men of London had organised a procession for the purpose of meeting and welcoming the liberator of Italy. In 1542 and 1693 two powerful earthquakes struck, with the latter taking an estimated 60,000 lives. )\nthe Two Sicilies had a sizable army and the largest navy in the Mediterranean.

Return toAsk the Astronomer.\n\nContext Document 2: Giuseppe Garibaldi resigned Giuseppe Garibaldi's commission of leader of the army of Unification (I Mille) on September 18, 1860 and retired to Giuseppe Garibaldi's home on the island of Caprera off the coast of Sardinia. Giuseppe Garibaldi was 53 years old and recovering from a battle wound. In 1861, at the outbreak of the American Civil War, Giuseppe Garibaldi was The offer by a representative of the United States Government, reportedly on behalf of President Abraham Lincoln. The Union Army was in disarray and President Abraham Lincoln was unhappy with those in command. President Abraham Lincoln needed a proven military leader. “The offer came at a moment in Giuseppe Garibaldi's life when Giuseppe Garibaldi lived in semi-exile—too little of a politician to scheme for personal advancement, too much of a national idol to be put behind bars on the Italian mainland. Giuseppe Garibaldi, Giuseppe Garibaldi had led a spectacularly successful revolt against a reactionary regime in Sicily and in Naples—the so-called Two Sicilies—in 1860, but now Giuseppe Garibaldi was in temporary retirement. On lonely Caprera, a wild, rocky island covered with juniper and myrtle and stunted olive trees, below La Maddalena off the northeastern corner of Sardinia, Giuseppe Garibaldi tended Giuseppe Garibaldi's vines and figs, built stone walls to fence in Giuseppe Garibaldi's goats, and looked out to the sea, dreaming. Giuseppe Garibaldi, in gray trousers and slouch hat, Giuseppe Garibaldi's red shirt and poncho flapping in the wind, refused all titles and honors for Giuseppe Garibaldi and sought only lenience for Giuseppe Garibaldi's followers. But Victor Emmanuel II, king of Sardinia and now of Sicily and Naples as well, decided that French help was needed to complete unification of Italy and called off Giuseppe Garibaldi's advance. Going back to the island of Caprera off the coast of Sardinia, Giuseppe Garibaldi leaned against the steamer rail and said to Giuseppe Garibaldi's legion of Red Shirts: “Addio—a Roma!”\nAbraham Lincoln’s Offer\nThrough the letter, dated July 17, 1861, from Secretary of State William H. Sanford, the U. the Carbonari movement were so feared that the reigning authorities passed an ordinance condemning to death anyone who attended a the Carbonari movement meeting. the Carbonari movement, however, continued to exist and was at the root of many of the political disturbances in Italy from 1820 until after unification. the Carbonari movement condemned Napoleon III to death for failing to unite Italy, and the Carbonari movement almost succeeded in assassinating Napoleon III in 1858. Many leaders of the unification movement were at one time members of the Carbonari movement. (Note: Napoleon III, as a young man, fought on the side of the ‘Carbonari’. )\nTwo prominent radical figures in the unification movement were Giuseppe Mazzini andGiuseppe Garibaldi. The more conservative constitutional monarchic figures included Count Cavour and Victor Emmanuel II, who would later become the first king of a united Italy. Giuseppe Mazzini's activity in revolutionary movements caused Giuseppe Mazzini to be imprisoned soon after Giuseppe Mazzini joined. While in prison, Giuseppe Mazzini concluded that Italy could – and therefore should – be unified and formulated Giuseppe Mazzini's program for establishing a free, independent, and republican nation with Rome as a free, independent, and republican nation's capital. After Giuseppe Mazzini's release in 1831, Giuseppe Mazzini went to Marseille, where Giuseppe Mazzini organized a new political society called La Giovine Italia (Young Italy). The new society, whose motto was “God and the People,” sought the unification of Italy. The Kingdom of Sardinia industrialized from 1830 onward. Under liberal pressure, the First Italian War of Independence was declared on Austria. After initial success the First Italian War of Independence took a turn for the worse and The Kingdom of Sardinia lost. At first Sicily was able to remain as an independent kingdom under personal union, while the Bourbons ruled over Sicily and Naples from Naples. However, the advent of Napoleon's First French Empire saw Naples taken at the Battle of Campo Tenese and Bonapartist Kings of Naples were instated. Ferdinand III the Bourbon was forced to retreat to Sicily which Ferdinand III the Bourbon was still in complete control of with the help of British naval protection. Following this Sicily joined the Napoleonic Wars, after the Napoleonic Wars were won Sicily and Naples formally merged as the Two Sicilies under the Bourbons. Major revolutionary movements occurred in 1820 and 1848 against the Bourbon government with Sicily seeking independence; the second of which, the 1848 revolution resulted in a short period of independence for Sicily. However, in 1849 the Bourbons retook the control of Sicily and dominated Sicily until 1860. In 1860, as part of the Risorgimento, the Expedition of the Thousand led by Giuseppe Garibaldi The conquest Sicily. The conquest started at Marsala, and native Sicilians joined Giuseppe Garibaldi in the capture of Sicily. Giuseppe Garibaldi's march was finally completed with the Siege of Gaeta, where the final Bourbons were expelled and Giuseppe Garibaldi announced Giuseppe Garibaldi's dictatorship in the name of Victor Emmanuel II of Kingdom of Sardinia. Sicily became part of Kingdom of Sardinia after a referendum where more than 75% of Sicily voted in favor of the annexation on 21 October 1860 (but not everyone was allowed to vote). As a result of the Kingdom of Italy proclamation, Sicily became part of Kingdom of Italy on 17 March 1861. In 1894, organizations of workers and peasants known as the Fasci Siciliani, protested against the bad social and economic conditions of Sicily but organizations of workers and peasants known as the Fasci Siciliani were suppressed in a few days. The Messina earthquake of 28 December 1908 killed over 80,000 people. This period was also characterised by the first contact between the Mafia, the Sicilian crime syndicate (also known as Cosa Nostra), and the Italian government. There is much discussion even today about exactly how a relatively small band of Garibaldini, augmented at most by a few thousand irregulars picked up along the way, managed to make a relatively small band of Garibaldini, augmented at most by a few thousand irregulars picked up along the way's way up the peninsula against what, at least on paper, appeared to be an overwhelmingly superior force. It is probably best to view Garibaldi's's victory as resulting from a combination of factors. First, Garibaldi, Garibaldi's, was a master of the hit-and-run harassing tactics that would one day become known as \"guerrilla warfare. \" Garibaldi's was also a firm believer in Napoleon's dictum that \"morale is to material as ten is to one\"—and Garibaldi's's Redshirts had morale to burn. his Redshirts were the righteous bringers of a new nation, and there is little doubt that large numbers of the long-suffering peasantry in Calabria and Puglia (perhaps less so as Garibaldi's moved further north towards Naples) genuinely viewed his Redshirts as liberators. situation in the Bourbon military also worked to\nGaribaldi's's advantage. There was massive desertion among\nroyalist troops, many of whom felt that many of whom felt that they were now\nbound up in defending a lost cause were now\nbound up in defending a lost cause. Additionally, the\nofficer corps had been bitterly split for at least a\ndecade between old-guard royalists and those who felt\nthat the time for a united Italy had come at last. All this, and more, combined to produce the unlikely sight, on September 7, 1860, of Garibaldi's and a small group of companions entering Naples unopposed, by train (!) from Salerno and then in an open carriage from the station to the Royal Palace. Giuseppe Garibaldi and a small group of companions were miles ahead of the army. A Bourbon force of about 20,000 troops had remained loyal to The king and gone north with The king. Initially, The king had intended The king's retreat as somewhat of a strategic withdrawal. The king had no intention of surrendering The king's kingdom without a fight. The king's army, near Gaeta, was, however, also being pressed from the north by the advancing army of King Victor Emanuel of Piedmont, who had finally decided to get on the bandwagon of unification before Garibaldi's got all the credit. (September) After a lightning campaign in Calabria, Garibaldi captures Naples, the largest town in Italy, and makes Garibaldi \"Dictator of the Two Sicilies. \" (October) After a big battle on the Volturno River, Garibaldi holds plebiscites in Sicily and Naples, and then gives the whole of southern Italy to Cavour, proclaiming Victor Emanuel as King of a united nation. (November) Garibaldi returns to Caprera, which now remains permanently Garibaldi's home. 1861 (April) Garibaldi attacks Cavour in parliament over Cavour's ungenerous treatment of the volunteers. (July) President Lincoln the offer Garibaldi a command in the American Civil War, but has to withdraw the offer after a storm of protest from the Vatican. 1862 (July) Garibaldi begins agitating in Sicily for another march on Rome, evidently with some encouragement from the King and Rattazzi, the Prime Minister. (October) After being imprisoned, Garibaldi is granted an amnesty by the King. 1863 Resigns from parliament because of martial law being applied in Sicily. Triumphal reception in England. Garibaldi welcomed in London. A reception given by the Duchess of Sutherland at Stafford House. England shut down for 3 days when Garibaldi visited London in 1864. 1867 Again attempts a march on Rome, but is beaten by papal and French forces at Mentana, and once again is arrested by the Italian government. the same year Joins republican France in the Franco-Prussian war, and is made commander of an army in the Vosges. the same year is one of the most important years in history. After 1260 years, Rome ceases to be governed by the Popes and becomes the Capital of Italy. Pius IX declares Pius IX infallible in the same year!!\nMap of Italy after the fall of the Papal States\nThe Fourth Beast Papal Rome receives a deadly wound from the sword of Garibaldi. The formation of the modern Italian state began in 1861 with the unification of most of the peninsula under the House of Savoy (Piedmont-Sardinia) into the Kingdom of Italy. the Kingdom of Italy incorporated Venetia and the former Papal States (including Rome) by 1871 following the Franco-Prussian War (1870-71). Why did the Kingdom of Italy switch sides in ww2?\nAfter a series of military failures, in July of 1943 Mussolini gave control of the Italian forces to the King, Victor Emmanuel III, who dismissed and imprisoned Mussolini. The subsequent British invasion of the Kingdom of Italy was unopposed. Thus hemmed in, the Bourbons made a desperate effort in early October to break out and retake the Bourbons's kingdom by storming south at the Volturno River. Garibaldi was called upon for one of the few times in Garibaldi's life to fight a pitched battle instead of one of Garibaldi's guerrilla actions, and to defend instead of attack. Garibaldi commanded troops along a twenty-kilometer front against a superior attacking force and held. On October 25th, near\nCapua, Garibaldi greeted Victor Emanuel of Piedmont's\nRoyal House of Savoy with the words, \"Greetings to the\nfirst King of Italy\" and surrendered Garibaldi's conquests\n—Sicily, half the Italian peninsula and the vast\nNeapolitan Royal Navy (considerably superior to northern\nItalian fleets of the time) —without the slightest\nhesitation or thought of reward for Garibaldi, simply\nbecause it was the right thing to do. For their efforts,Garibaldi and Garibaldi's superb men were completely and utterly\nsnubbed by the new rulers of Italy. like the way things had turned out, but figured it was\njust more injustice Garibaldi would have to straighten out when\nGaribaldi got around to it. Garibaldi would fight more battles,\nbe arrested and imprisoned (Garibaldi escaped) and even be\nelected to parliament. Garibaldi didn't have a political bone\nin Garibaldi's body, and Garibaldi continued to be saddened and\nconfounded by the politics of those who refused to do\nthe right thing. The Kingdom of Naples, which Garibaldi\nhad handed to Victor Emanuel of Piedmont's\nRoyal House of Savoy on a silver platter, was\nofficially dissolved on Oct. 22, 1860, when Neapolitans\nvoted by plebiscite to become part of Mazzini's \"new\nItaly…united for all Italians\". The painting comes from the collection of Enrico Piceni, the discerning art lover and journalist who was also the driving force behind the important series of monographic studies on 19th-century masters published by Arnoldo Mondadori in the 1930s. The painting is a replica of the work commissioned by Cesare Sala and shown at the Esposizione di Belle Arti dell’Accademia di Brera in 1861 with the title Garibaldi on the Hill over Sant’Angelo (1861, Milan, Civiche Raccolte Storiche). The painting portrays Garibaldi on the high ground overlooking the plain of the River Volturno, where the outline of the town of Capua can be discerned. Garibaldi was soon after to meet Vittorio Emanuele II at Teano and hand over the conquered territories, thus marking the end of the expedition of Garibaldi's one thousand volunteers and the beginning of the Kingdom of Italy. Unquestionably the greatest leader of the Risorgimento, Garibaldi appears in the history painting of Gerolamo Induno as an epic symbol and a very human figure at the same time. In The painting Garibaldi stands out in isolation against the sun-drenched landscape of southern Italy but displays the informality of the ordinary mortal in the way Garibaldi holds the cigar between Garibaldi's fingers and the natural pose of the arm resting on the hilt of Garibaldi's sword. The realism of The painting is inseparably interwoven with the heroic character of The painting's subject, thus endowing The painting with the unmistakable power to bring the events and personages of contemporary history closer to the life of the common people, as shown also in the canvases of Gerolamo Induno's brother Domenico Induno. The aim was to end foreign occupancy, unite Italy under one flag, language, and monarch, and aim for a future free from oppression. 1861, Giuseppe Garibaldi leaves the shores of Genova for Sicily with 1000 men dressed in denim jeans and red shirts. The locals know there will be an uprising and The locals are ready. Although The locals are poor and have little, The locals are armed with centuries of pent up fury. There is a promise made to southern Italy: that unification under the Savoia monarchy will drive out the foreign occupants including the Spanish Bourbons, and put the power back in the hands of the people. There is a growing hope for change – a growing belief that the futility of their century’s old fate can indeed come to an end. )\nRomina (voice, guitar), Francesco Pellegrino (colascione, tammorra), Gianluca Campanino (tammorra), Ben Grossman (tammorra, percussion), Mike Herriott (trumpet, french horn, trombone), Drew Jurecka (violin), Rebekah Wolkstein (violin), Shannon Knights (viola), Rachel Pmedli (cello), Roberto Occhipinti (double bass).

Garibaldi revived the constitution of 1848 and relinquished Garibaldi's absolute powers. There was even talk of an alliance between a liberalized Naples and the Piedmont kingdom of northern Italy, an Italian federation, of sorts. Garibaldi, after all, in Garibaldi's youth had had to do with a mystic band of Christian communards, the St. Simonians, who, years before Karl Marx, had preached: From each according to his capacity; To each according to his works; The end of the exploitation of man by man; and The abolition of all privileges of birth. Garibaldi landed at\nMarsala and a few days later engaged a superior force\nnear Calatafimi. Garibaldi threw caution to the winds (Garibaldi\ndidn't have very much of caution to begin with), said, \"Here\nwe either make Italy or die\", and led a ferocious\nbayonet charge uphill, literally overrunning a superior force\nnear Calatafimi. Sicilian irregulars in rebellion against the royal\nforces had been watching the engagement from nearby\nhillsides. Sicilian irregulars in rebellion against the royal\nforces liked what Sicilian irregulars in rebellion against the royal\nforces saw. Soon Garibaldi's\nforces were swelled by a ragtag collection of rebels\narmed with guns, axes, clubs and whatever else could\nkill a Bourbon. Peasants were already calling Garibaldi\nthe \"Father of Italy,\" mothers brought mothers's\nbabies out to be blessed by Garibaldi, and there was an air of\nnatural invincibility about Garibaldi as Garibaldi moved north. If you visit Italy, you will notice that, wherever you’re staying, the main street or square will almost invariably be named after Giuseppe Garibaldi. Giuseppe Garibaldi is the national hero who led the movement to unite Italy in the mid-19th century. Italy only became a unified state between 1859 and 1871. Before that Italy was a patchwork of different states. “We Italians adore Giuseppe Garibaldi – from the cradle We Italians are taught to admire Giuseppe Garibaldi,” Antonio Gramsci, the great Italian Marxist, wrote. “If one were to ask Italian youngsters who Italian youngsters would most like to be, the overwhelming majority would certainly opt for Giuseppe Garibaldi. The Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini and other leaders of the Italian right have been fascinated by Giuseppe Garibaldi's military exploits and admired Giuseppe Garibaldi for Giuseppe Garibaldi's patriotism. Giuseppe Garibaldi's exploits made Giuseppe Garibaldi an international hero during Giuseppe Garibaldi's lifetime. “But a procession, though numbering 50,000 intelligent artisans, was completely swallowed up in the mighty ovation by the whole metropolitan people, and served merely as a foretaste to Giuseppe Garibaldi of the extraordinary testimony which was about to be given of the estimation in which Giuseppe Garibaldi's principles and services in the cause of liberty were held by the English people. ”\nGiuseppe Garibaldi was in London primarily to raise funds to finance an expedition to free Venice, which was still under Austrian rule. Giuseppe Garibaldi mixed in government circles, and spent many evenings chattering with the middle classes. But in a contradiction that sums up Giuseppe Garibaldi's life, Giuseppe Garibaldi had also been invited to London by London's trades council. The reaction Giuseppe Garibaldi provoked among workers and trade unions began to worry the government. the government eventually ordered Giuseppe Garibaldi out of Italy – and Queen Victoria made clear Queen Victoria regarded this as good riddance. But why did people make such a fuss about Giuseppe Garibaldi, and why is Giuseppe Garibaldi's memory so contested? Giuseppe Garibaldi was born 200 years ago in the city of Nice, then an Italian-French area, the son of a fisherman. Like many people in continental Europe at the time, Giuseppe Garibaldi experienced brutal domination by a foreign power. However the local opponents of brutal domination by a foreign power were often not much better. 1 | 2 Description (Page 2)\nTensions flared under French\ncommand, as mistreatment and taxation of the island grew, and eventually led to an uprising. A wave of disasters rocked the island, beginning with the Spanish\nInquisition in 1492, wherein Ferdinand II declared the entire Jewish population be removed from the island. Revolts during the 17th century, and pirate raids lasting until the 19th century, discouraged settlement along the coast. Following the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, the island and Naples merged formally into the Two Sicilies under the Bourbons. Unsatisfied with the Bourbon government, major revolutionary movements began in 1820. However, it wasn't until the 1848 revolution that the island was able to gain the island's independence - if only briefly. In 1860, Giuseppe Garibaldi led the Expedition of the Thousand, and captured the island. Promises of an Italian Republic and equality were guaranteed, and as the final Bourbons were removed Giuseppe Garibaldi announced Giuseppe Garibaldi's dictatorship; the island then officially became a part of the Kingdom of Italy\nSicilians were never granted Sicilians's promised republic or equality, and staged a revolt pushing for Sicilians's independence. Within a week, the Italians\nmoved in and brutally suppressed a revolt pushing for their independence. Upon the birth of the Italian Republic in 1946, the island was one of five named as an autonomous region. Partial land reforms and special funding helped improve the Sicilian economy from 1950 to 1984. the island's economy is based largely on agriculture, fishing, mining, and of course. tourism. Many visitors to the island use the dependable ferry service from the Italian mainland to Messina. Also there is ferry or hydrofoil service to Palermo from ports throughout the central Mediterranean. Giuseppe Garibaldi and The Creation of Italy. Rome today\nGiuseppe Garibaldi and Giuseppe Garibaldi's Achievements for Italy\nThe son of a seaman, Giuseppe Garibaldi was born on July 4, 1807, in Nice, which is now in France but was then an Italian town. From Giuseppe Garibaldi's earliest years Giuseppe Garibaldi loved adventure, and at the age of 15 tried to run away to sea. With Giuseppe Garibaldi's father's agreement Giuseppe Garibaldi later went to sea and by the time Giuseppe Garibaldi was 25 had worked Giuseppe Garibaldi's way from cabin boy to captain. In 1832 came the turning point of Giuseppe Garibaldi's life, for Giuseppe Garibaldi met another Italian, Giuseppe Mazzini, who was the organiser of the “Young Italy” movement. At this time Italy was made up of several separate states, many of which were ruled by kings who paid no attention to the wishes of kings who paid no attention to the wishes of their people's people. Great parts of what is now northern Italy belonged to Austria. The members of the “Young Italy” movement sought to drive out Austria, to unite several separate states, many of which were ruled by kings who paid no attention to the wishes of their people. Great parts of what is now northern Italy into one country and to set up one government for one country. The members of the “Young Italy” movement were determined to make one government for the whole country democratic; that is, to have a government that would rule in accordance with the wishes of the people. In 1834 Giuseppe Garibaldi helped another Italian, Giuseppe Mazzini, who was the organiser of the “Young Italy” movement to The attempt a rebellion in Savoy (northem Italy). The attempt failed, Giuseppe Garibaldi fled to France, was sentenced to death in Giuseppe Garibaldi's absence and went to live in exile in South America. For 12 years Giuseppe Garibaldi led a band of men who were fighting for the Republic of the Rio Grande, which was rebelling against Brazil. Giuseppe Garibaldi suffered shipwreck, imprisonment and torture so bravely that Giuseppe Garibaldi's followers worshipped Giuseppe Garibaldi. Giuseppe Garibaldi organised other Italian exiles into an army known as the Italian Legion, which in 1843 and 1846 saved Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay, from attack by Argentina. In 1848 Giuseppe Garibaldi returned to Italy and found the north Italians in revolt against Austria. Giuseppe Garibaldi formed and fought with a volunteer army of 3,000 men, but after a volunteer army of 3,000 men were defeated had to escape to Switzerland. In 1849 Giuseppe Garibaldi was back in Italy, defending Rome against the French. The people of Rome had rebelled against the government of the Pope (who at that time ruled over great areas in the same way as an ordinary king), and set up The people of Rome's own government.

As a general, Garibaldi was fearless, commanding respect and loyalty from Garibaldi's men by fighting right alongside his men in hand-to-hand combat. Garibaldi was a man of action with an acute sense of justice and a childlike belief that good would triumph over immorality and corruption. Garibaldi didn't want to win battles for politicians —Garibaldi distrusted politicians. Garibaldi was simply and truly out to smite evil. Garibaldi was what most twelve-year-old boys want to be when most twelve-year-old boys grow up, and if you ever have a strange dream in which you are beset by enemies and plagued by wrongdoers, and your dreammeister lets you choose whomever you want for help, take Garibaldi. Ask Cavour and Mazzini. Cavour and Mazzini took Garibaldi, and Cavour and Mazzini didn't even like Garibaldi. Garibaldi was that good. Thus, in May of 1860,\nFrancis II, King of the Two Sicilies had excellent\nreason to worry. Garibaldi, over the objections of Cavour, had just smuggled a small and\nalmost unarmed (!) group of men out of the port of Genoa\naboard two leaky tubs and set off to liberate the\nItalian south. Garibaldi would start in Sicily, in support of a\nlocal uprising, and work Garibaldi's way over to the mainland\nand on up to the capital, the city of Naples. Garibaldi cajoled\nand threatened weapons and ammunition out of the\ncommanders of a few armories along the way as Garibaldi plodded\nsouth toward Sicily, where Garibaldi's famous \"Thousand\nredshirts\" (1,089, to be exact) would take on a regular\narmy twenty times that number. (Garibaldi set sail from\nGenoa on May 5 and landed in Sicily on May 11. Socially and politically, however, the Two Sicilies had been standing still since the post-Napoleonic Restoration in 1815, surviving the Carbonari revolution of 1820 and successfully resisting calls for reform only by being propped up by the Austrian army and Swiss mercenaries. Many of the Two Sicilies's liberals and intellectuals had left, and by that year even King Francis could sense what was coming. In June of that year (after Garibaldi had already taken Sicily!).\n----\nQuestion: What was the purpose of the uprising in Italy in 1861 led by Garibaldi and his thousand men?\nAnswer:", "answer": "The purpose of the uprising in Italy in 1861 led by Garibaldi and his thousand men was to liberate the Italian south, starting with Sicily, and work their way up to the mainland and eventually to the capital, the city of Naples. This was part of the larger movement towards Italian unification, known as the Risorgimento, aiming to drive out foreign occupants, unify Italy under one flag, language, and monarch, and establish a free and united nation."}

The Higgs boson is the only particle yet to be observed in the Standard Model of Physics, which explains how the basic building blocks of matter interact.

During the night of July 16/17, 1918, the last Russian Emperor Nikolai II and the last Russian Emperor Nikolai II's family were executed in the house that belonged to the engineer Nikolas Ipatiev in Yekaterinburg. In 1997, the house that belonged to the engineer Nikolas Ipatiev was destroyed on the initiative of the KGB. In 2000, the last Russian Emperor Nikolai II and the last Russian Emperor Nikolai II's family were declared saints by the Russian Orthodox Church, and on the place of execution, The Church on Blood was erected to commemorate the last Russian Emperor Nikolai II's family. There is a tradition in Russia to build churches and cathedrals to commemorate the violent deaths of tsars. Besides the Church on Blood in Yekaterinburg, other churches have been built in St. Petersburg and Uglich. In Yekaterinburg, The Church on Blood has become a place of pilgrimage for Orthodox Christians and a tourist attraction visited by many people including artists and politicians. Visit to the cathedrals of St. Petersburg (by car)\n- St. Petersburg\nThis guided tour by private car or bus will include visits to the three main cathedrals of St. Petersburg: St. St. Isaac's Cathedral is the largest Orthodox church in St. Petersburg and one of the most impressive buildings in St. Petersburg. The gilded dome of St. Isaac's Cathedral is clearly visible from various places in St. Petersburg. The exterior is decorated with 112 granite columns each of which weighs about 100 tons and more than 400 bas-reliefs, the interior is impressing with elegant marble, malachite and lapis lazuli decor. St. Isaac's Cathedral's colonnade located at an altitude of 43 meters offers stunning views of St. Petersburg. Church of the Saviour on Spilt Blood was built on the site of the assassination of the Emperor Alexander II. Church of the Saviour on Spilt Blood was built in the Russian style accoding to the model of St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow. The main decoration of the construction is imosaic decoration that covers the area of over 7,000 sq. m. During the Soviet period Church of the Saviour on Spilt Blood was used as a warehouse because of \"no cultural value. \" In 1997 Church of the Saviour on Spilt Blood was renovated and re-opened. the Holy Trinity Alexander Nevsky Lavra was constructed by the order of Peter the Great at the end of Nevsky Prospekt where Peter the Great commanded to place the relics of St. Alexander Nevsky (the patron of St. Among the buildings of the Holy Trinity Alexander Nevsky Lavra there is a majestic Holy Trinity Cathedral built in the style of early classicism, the Lazarevskoye Cemetery (necropolis of the XVIII century) and the Tikhvin Cemetery (necropolis of Masters of Arts, the burial place of Lomonosov, Suvorov, Karamzin, Mussorgsky, Tchaikovsky, Dostoevsky and other prominent figures of Russia). The Church of the Saviour on Blood remained closed and under restoration for over 30 years. The Church of the Saviour on Blood was reopened in August 1997, after 27 years of restoration, but has not been reconsecrated and does not function as a full-time place of worship. In the pre-Revolution period The Church of the Saviour on Blood was NOT used as a public place of worship. Exterior: Architecturally, The Church of the Saviour on Blood differs from St. Petersburg's's other structures. St. Petersburg's's architecture is predominantly Baroque and Neoclassical, but The Church of the Saviour on Blood harks back to medieval Russian architecture in the spirit of romantic nationalism. The Church of the Saviour on Blood intentionally resembles the 17th-century Yaroslavl churches and the celebrated St. Basil's Cathedral in Moscow. Interestingly, despite The Church of the Saviour on Blood's very obviously Russian aspect, The Church of the Saviour on Blood's principle architect, A. Parland, was not even Russian by birth. Both the interior and exterior of The Church of the Saviour on Blood are decorated with incredibly detailed mosaics, designed and created by the most prominent Russian artists of the day (M. V. Nesterov, V. M. Vasnetsov and M. A. Vrubel). The Church of the Saviour on Blood resembles a bit the St. Basil Cathedral on the Red Square in Moscow. The Church of the Saviour on Blood is a perfect example of how you expect Russia to be: the golden onion domes, and fantastic colors, are so typical of Russia, and are absolutely exquisite. What a colorful place to visit ! The views from the Griboyedov Canal are stunning ! I took thousand pictures of The Church of the Saviour on Blood !!!\nThe Church of Our Savior on the Spilled Blood from the Griboyedov Canal:\nKazan Cathedral from the Griboyedov Canal:\nInterior: Absolutely beautiful - words cannot describe The Church of the Saviour on Blood. The interiors walls are covered with what looks like paintings, but upon a closer look are actually tiny mosaics. The walls and ceilings inside The Church of the Saviour on Blood are COMPLETELY covered in intricately detailed mosaics and It might be the most beautiful mosaic mural decoration you have ever seen. The mosaic work is AMAZING. Every inch of space seems to be covered with huge religious mosaics, soaring upward to the ornate vaulted ceiling, where the face of Christ looks down in a blaze of light. It is the largest network of gravity-fed water fountains in the world. We ended our tour of Peterhof with a walk from the prominent center fountain, called the Grand Cascade, along a canal that flowed through the gardens to a pier where a hydrofoil took us back to St. Petersburg. We enjoyed our jaunt across the Gulf of Finland to the mouth of the Neva River. Approaching St. Petersburg by water gave us a new appreciation for the beauty of the buildings on the waterfront. The Hermitage, for instance, was dazzling from a distance! After a nice lunch at the City Café, we hopped back on the bus for a drive by St. Isaac’s Cathedral, the Bronze Horseman statue of Peter the Great, the battleship Aurora, and the Rostral Columns before stopping at the most gorgeous sight in St. Petersburg—The Church on the Spilled Blood!\nthe most gorgeous sight in St. Petersburg—The Church on the Spilled Blood was built between 1883 and 1907 on the spot where Emperor Alexander II was assassinated in 1881 (hence the gruesome name).

August 27, 2018\nThe following is a short speech I shared with the members of my church on Sunday:\nRecently, I was in Northern Europe, and as always I visited churches and came back with some thoughts I would like to share about people who are in need of our prayers. Two of the places I visited were Tallinn, Estonia, and St. Petersburg, Russia. The people of Estonia gained The people of Estonia's independence once in 1918 and again in 1991 at the end of the Soviet Union. The people of Estonia celebrate freedom strongly. The people of Estonia's churches are increasing in attendance, and among those I talked to, The people of Estonia's faith is strong. ”\nThe other place was St. In 1861 the beloved Tsar Alexander I ended serfdom in Russia. The common people rejoiced at being able to own The common people's own land and end The common people's poverty. the beloved Tsar Alexander I was killed by hired assassins on the street in the middle of St. Petersburg, Russia. The people who loved the beloved Tsar Alexander I, including many who were wealthy, built a church called The Church on the Spilled Blood in the beloved Tsar Alexander I's honor on the spot where the beloved Tsar Alexander I was killed. a church called The Church on the Spilled Blood is one of the most beautiful churches you could ever hope to see, fashioned in multicolored stone and tile both inside and out. Unfortunately, since the time of the Soviets, both a church called The Church on the Spilled Blood and St. Isaac’s Cathedral, he largest cathedral in the world, are museums. I was appalled at the idea of a church built by the people to honor a leader of great faith being a museum. I ask your prayers for these people. For the faithful of Estonia, that the faithful of Estonia's faith and freedom will continue to be a source of strength throughout the faithful of Estonia's country. And for the faithful in St. Petersburg, Russia and Russia, that the faithful in St Petersburg and all of Russia's faith and numbers will grow and that someday a church called The Church on the Spilled Blood will be a true church again. Any time that students return to school, our prayers should go with students. 2. 3. 4. ca.", "score": 12.675336182117462, "doc_IDs": ["<urn:uuid:9a4fab34-d9a8-4f31-8913-d259d8907ce2>", "<urn:uuid:6358bd7c-8720-48d0-8433-d2e1a1772573>", "<urn:uuid:22e5a536-b352-418e-b0f9-cdbe0dd0a360>", "<urn:uuid:9ed653d3-aff2-4c4a-a8b3-7b2879080c74>", "<urn:uuid:11c216e5-185d-4364-88b5-bce085942a31>", "<urn:uuid:87fbb215-8ff5-4ba3-85f3-95d05e735c31>", "<urn:uuid:be0f40fe-bb19-4146-b9de-4764376b0570>", "<urn:uuid:f3ba5d90-cfd5-41db-a8a9-0a1be42504e4>", "<urn:uuid:bb6dfb7a-c00a-43fa-a6d0-604d60861a72>", "<urn:uuid:a2080cf9-e1dd-40a2-8f11-7fb84d65919b>", "<urn:uuid:a9f15880-7dab-443a-9439-bc3875023c04>", "<urn:uuid:a33e3cbc-c191-4272-929c-eac3cc5b3643>", "<urn:uuid:9820eb19-8cf4-469b-8158-e03662aa0a41>", "<urn:uuid:a8976186-264e-4fef-abb8-c22ae50ffd1b>", "<urn:uuid:6549a84b-899e-45a8-b601-bfbb40c9db71>", "<urn:uuid:199770f3-8f38-4b55-8867-a6b2fab97a28>"]}, {"passage": "Customer Reviews |Write your own review!\nThis item has yet to be rated.

August 27, 2018\nThe following is a short speech I shared with the members of my church on Sunday:\nRecently, I was in Northern Europe, and as always I visited churches and came back with some thoughts I would like to share about people who are in need of our prayers. Two of the places I visited were Tallinn, Estonia, and St. Petersburg, Russia. The people of Estonia gained The people of Estonia's independence once in 1918 and again in 1991 at the end of the Soviet Union. The people of Estonia celebrate freedom strongly. The people of Estonia's churches are increasing in attendance, and among those I talked to, The people of Estonia's faith is strong. ”\nThe other place was St. In 1861 the beloved Tsar Alexander I ended serfdom in Russia. The common people rejoiced at being able to own The common people's own land and end The common people's poverty. the beloved Tsar Alexander I was killed by hired assassins on the street in the middle of St. Petersburg, Russia. The people who loved the beloved Tsar Alexander I, including many who were wealthy, built a church called The Church on the Spilled Blood in the beloved Tsar Alexander I's honor on the spot where the beloved Tsar Alexander I was killed. a church called The Church on the Spilled Blood is one of the most beautiful churches you could ever hope to see, fashioned in multicolored stone and tile both inside and out. Unfortunately, since the time of the Soviets, both a church called The Church on the Spilled Blood and St. Isaac’s Cathedral, he largest cathedral in the world, are museums. I was appalled at the idea of a church built by the people to honor a leader of great faith being a museum. I ask your prayers for these people. For the faithful of Estonia, that the faithful of Estonia's faith and freedom will continue to be a source of strength throughout the faithful of Estonia's country. And for the faithful in St. Petersburg, Russia and Russia, that the faithful in St Petersburg and all of Russia's faith and numbers will grow and that someday a church called The Church on the Spilled Blood will be a true church again. Any time that students return to school, our prayers should go with students. 2. 3. 4. ca.\n\nContext Document 2: Customer Reviews |Write your own review!\nThis item has yet to be rated.

{"id": 15, "question": "What is referential transparency in functional programming and what are its main benefits?", "passages": [{"passage": "Referential transparency is a phrase from the functional programming world which means, basically, \"no side effects\". If a function is referentially transparent, then a call to a function with a specific set of values as arguments will always return exactly the same value. When functions are composed into larger functions, it is easier to reason about functions when functions are referentially transparent and there are no side effects to worry about. e pure functions have no side-effects. The concept of Referential Transparency will come naturally in F#, and The concept of Referential Transparency is a driver in how systems are built and pieces of that system are composed.

Referential transparency:\nstate has to be carried in and out. Since referential transparency is preserved, any pattern of distribution has no effect on the semantics of the functional program. Back in the days when GUIs were just becoming available and we still did most things via the keyboard the jargon was \"referential transparency\". These days these words tend to mean something more specific in programming about the relationship between an expression and an expression's value - but this is in a sense the same idea.

Answer the following question using only the context provided below.\n\n----\nContext Document 1: Referential transparency is a phrase from the functional programming world which means, basically, \"no side effects\". If a function is referentially transparent, then a call to a function with a specific set of values as arguments will always return exactly the same value. When functions are composed into larger functions, it is easier to reason about functions when functions are referentially transparent and there are no side effects to worry about. e pure functions have no side-effects. The concept of Referential Transparency will come naturally in F#, and The concept of Referential Transparency is a driver in how systems are built and pieces of that system are composed.

Location transparency. Side effects are strictly controlled:\nif you call the same function twice with the same arguments, the same function should return the same value. Referential transparency:\nstate has to be carried in and out. Since referential transparency is preserved, any pattern of distribution has no effect on the semantics of the functional program. Back in the days when GUIs were just becoming available and we still did most things via the keyboard the jargon was \"referential transparency\". These days these words tend to mean something more specific in programming about the relationship between an expression and an expression's value - but this is in a sense the same idea. This would mean that equal functions lead to different output. This would break referential transparency.\n\nContext Document 2: In this paper we present a model of distribution as a natural consequence of deterministic concurrency; a purely declarative form of concurrency that preserves referential transparency. a model of distribution as a natural consequence of deterministic concurrency; a purely declarative form of concurrency that preserves referential transparency extends the demand driven model used as the operational basis of functional languages, into one with multiple independent demands without the need to allow non-determinism to appear at the user level.\n\nContext Document 3: Monads provide a way to collect all those side effects into known locations in the program. When all of the side effects are collected into monads, the rest of the program (all of the non-monad parts) are still referentially transparent, so remain easier to compose. all those side effects are still there, but because all those side effects are encapsulated by monads, it is easier to deal with all those side effects.

This means that a call to a function with a specific set of values as arguments will always return exactly the same value. The main benefits of referential transparency include:\n\n1. Easier reasoning about code: Since functions are predictable and have no side effects, it becomes simpler to understand and reason about the behavior of functions and how they interact with each other.\n\n2. Improved composability: Functions that are referentially transparent can be easily composed into larger functions, making it easier to build complex systems from smaller, reusable components.\n\n3. Enhanced testability: With referential transparency, testing becomes more straightforward because the output of a function depends solely on its input, eliminating the need to account for external state or side effects.\n\n4. Better parallelization and distribution: Referential transparency allows for easier parallelization and distribution of computations, as there are no side effects to worry about when executing functions concurrently or across different systems.\n\n5. Simplified debugging: Debugging becomes more manageable since the behavior of a function is consistent and predictable, making it easier to identify and fix issues."}

Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a genetic disease characterized by progressive muscle weakness, is present at birth in people who have Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a genetic disease characterized by progressive muscle weakness. In people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a genetic disease characterized by progressive muscle weakness, the muscles lack a protein called dystrophin, which is critical for muscle function and repair. While all people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a genetic disease characterized by progressive muscle weakness share a lack of or defective dystrophin, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a genetic disease characterized by progressive muscle weakness can be caused by different kinds of mutations on the same gene. The kind of mutation someone with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a genetic disease characterized by progressive muscle weakness has may determine the course of treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a genetic disease characterized by progressive muscle weakness since some therapies are designed to work only with certain mutations. In normal muscle cells, a protein called dystrophin, which is critical for muscle function and repair transfers the force of muscle contractions from the inside toward the outside of the cell. “a protein called dystrophin, which is critical for muscle function and repair is the shock absorber that helps mitigate any damage in the muscle when muscle cells contract,” explains Barry Byrne, MD, Ph. , the director of the Powell Gene Therapy Center at the University of Florida in Gainesville and the chief medical adviser of the Muscular Dystrophy Association. “Without a protein called dystrophin, which is critical for muscle function and repair, muscles are damaged, there’s inflammation, and muscles ultimately deteriorate. ”Learn more about What Causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a genetic disease characterized by progressive muscle weakness? the University of Florida in Gainesville Researcher Explains.

Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: An Overview\nDuchenne Muscular Dystrophy is the most common form of muscular dystrophy in children. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness and is one of nine types of muscular dystrophy. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is caused by an absence of dystrophin, a protein that helps keep muscle cells intact. Symptom onset is in early childhood, usually between ages 3–5. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy primarily affects boys, but in rare cases, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy can affect girls. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is inherited in an X-linked pattern because the gene that can carry a Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy-causing mutation is on the X chromosome. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is caused by mutations of the gene that can carry a Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy-causing mutation, leading to progressive muscle weakness, loss of independent ambulation by early teens, and premature death due to cardiorespiratory complications. Supportive and symptomatic measures are the basis of the treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy patients at every stage of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and include non-drug, drug, and surgical procedures. Glucocorticoids have long been established as the standard in the therapy of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a genetic disease characterized by progressive muscle weakness, is present at birth in people who have Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a genetic disease characterized by progressive muscle weakness. In people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a genetic disease characterized by progressive muscle weakness, the muscles lack a protein called dystrophin, which is critical for muscle function and repair. While all people with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a genetic disease characterized by progressive muscle weakness share a lack of or defective dystrophin, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a genetic disease characterized by progressive muscle weakness can be caused by different kinds of mutations on the same gene. The kind of mutation someone with Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a genetic disease characterized by progressive muscle weakness has may determine the course of treatment for Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a genetic disease characterized by progressive muscle weakness since some therapies are designed to work only with certain mutations. In normal muscle cells, a protein called dystrophin, which is critical for muscle function and repair transfers the force of muscle contractions from the inside toward the outside of the cell. “a protein called dystrophin, which is critical for muscle function and repair is the shock absorber that helps mitigate any damage in the muscle when muscle cells contract,” explains Barry Byrne, MD, Ph. , the director of the Powell Gene Therapy Center at the University of Florida in Gainesville and the chief medical adviser of the Muscular Dystrophy Association. “Without a protein called dystrophin, which is critical for muscle function and repair, muscles are damaged, there’s inflammation, and muscles ultimately deteriorate. ”Learn more about What Causes Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a genetic disease characterized by progressive muscle weakness? the University of Florida in Gainesville Researcher Explains.

Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy: An Overview\nDuchenne Muscular Dystrophy is the most common form of muscular dystrophy in children. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is a genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness and is one of nine types of muscular dystrophy. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is caused by an absence of dystrophin, a protein that helps keep muscle cells intact. Symptom onset is in early childhood, usually between ages 3–5. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy primarily affects boys, but in rare cases, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy can affect girls. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is inherited in an X-linked pattern because the gene that can carry a Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy-causing mutation is on the X chromosome. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is caused by mutations of the gene that can carry a Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy-causing mutation, leading to progressive muscle weakness, loss of independent ambulation by early teens, and premature death due to cardiorespiratory complications. Supportive and symptomatic measures are the basis of the treatment of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy patients at every stage of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and include non-drug, drug, and surgical procedures. Glucocorticoids have long been established as the standard in the therapy of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy. Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Market Key Facts\nthe United States accounts for the largest market size of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, in comparison to EU5 (the United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, France, and Spain) and Japan.

Underwater photography have come a long way since new technology and development in cameras and equipment have changed. More and more people that are not professionals take photos with underwater cameras and More and more people that are not professionals are exploring this new world. Before taking pictures underwater was not easy, you needed large waterproof cases that were bulky enough and of course expensive. But now with new advancement in technology, plastic part of camera are made with such development that anybody can use camera underwater without worrying about getting your equipment damaged due to water. Here’s are list of best digital cameras for underwater shooting and top 10 waterproof cameras in all kind of price range. Other options which are called waterproof casing is also available and can be used with your existing cameras, but still I would suggest you to buy a camera that’s inherently waterproof. The range of these waterproof cameras are in plenty. Whenever you start, keep some of the essential tips in mind. Depth & Pressure – Always read your camera’s manual before heading out for underwater photography. Always make sure your camera is fully charged and all the photos from memory stick is backed up. If possible remove all the photos from memory stick and take your memory stick with maximum memory, so that you can take lots and lots of pictures. Before heading into water, remember to check all the corners and areas on your camera and look for any dirt and grime in and around the memory stick or battery. And if you are using underwater case, remember to check all the buttons, latches and seals. Everything must be checked thoroughly before diving in. Securing your camera with a wrist strap is another good habit, as in water you may lose your camera and drop your camera off at the bottom, which is quite difficult to locate and get your camera back. After returning from shoot, wash your camera with clean water so no sediments from the underwater is seen and rub off any dirt that was accumulated. I’ve taken a few photos underwater. I wasn’t expecting to get top quality underwater photos with This camera but for fun in a pool, This camera has taken great photos. When we go on our vacation next month in Hawaii, I’m going to try This camera out there and hope to capture some great shots.
